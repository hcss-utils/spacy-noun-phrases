The debate centers on the Russian service module, which will form a key part of the station when launched in 1998. The Russian Space Agency has had trouble getting its government to fork out funds to pay contractors building the module. On 10 March, Vice President Gore warned Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in a strongly worded letter that Russia's failure to fully fund its portion of the station ""could lead our opponents in Congress to kill our partnership."" Gore asked Chernomyrdin to ensure ""adequate and steady funding"" to avoid launch slips and suggested the United States might begin preparing monthly status reports on Russia's progress. Gore's warning follows an 8 March letter to Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets from Representatives Jerry Lewis and James Sensenbrenner , who must defend 1997 station spending this spring as chairs of panels that oversee the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. They asserted that ""a slip in the schedule of the service module seriously threatens continued congressional support for Russian participation"" in the program. Russia anticipated the U.S. complaints: They came just as a 4 March letter from Soskovets was making its way to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole ""to reaffirm the Russian government's commitment to provide economic and financial support"" for the station. Russian officials in Moscow were meeting last week to find money to pay the contractors and allay U.S. concerns."

Mamedov told delegates the treaty does not unfairly limit Russia's land-based strategic missiles because the life-cycle of existing missiles expires in 2000-2005 and Russia does not have the funds to develop new types of ICBMs. He also emphasized the continued development of Topol missiles will provide Moscow with ""a compact and sufficiently invulnerable grouping of missiles."" According to Mamedov, the START II Treaty will also reduce the counterforce capability of the two arsenals by 80 percent in Russia and 65 percent in the U.S. In a translation provided by Federal News Service, the deputy foreign minister further estimated that 15 trillion rubles will be needed for implementing START I and 25 million rubles for START II. Linking START II to the 1972 ABM Treaty, Mamedov told the Russian lawmakers that ""if the U.S. does not strictly adhere to the ABM treaty... there can be no question of ratification.""

1c6260f9-5514-4a2c-ae38-24e5549ccfef,"NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia -- The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush, pursuing its brand of business-centered economic diplomacy, is urging Russia to enact significant reforms in a few regions to demonstrate how the entire country could attract private foreign investment. Frustrated by his own past efforts to invest in Russia's aluminum industry, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is lobbying Russian and Western European officials to support creation of prototype Russian investment zones. Officials would take a tough stand against corruption in these areas, contracts would be enforceable and the rule of law applied. ""If they choose a place they can get their arms around, the probability of making a real difference is greater than if they try to achieve this over their entire 5,000-mile expanse at one time,"" Mr. O'Neill said during a trip to Russia last week. The secretary's proposal, still in its formative stages, meshes with the Bush administration's strategy of tackling Russia's economic problems by making it more attractive to business investment. During most of the former U.S. President Bill Clinton's time in office, Russia was heavily dependent on multibillion-dollar international rescue packages. The Bush economic team considers those loans as wasted money. Now, with the weakened ruble sparking an industrial comeback and high oil prices filling government coffers, Washington sees an opportunity to shift to a private-investment model. Mr. Bush's team is concentrating on promoting Western companies investing in Russia and expanding business with their Russian counterparts, as well as reducing barriers to commerce by helping the country secure membership in the World Trade Organization. Mr. O'Neill has been intrigued by the investment-zone concept since 1999, when as chairman of Alcoa Inc. he tried to buy a $1 billion Russian aluminum smelter and metal fabricator. But he had to back off the deal when he realized the company had no reliable way to enforce electricity-supply contracts or other critical elements of the project. In Mr. O'Neill's vision, regions would receive outside assistance if they reform their courts and bureaucracies so that investors can be certain the rules of the game will be fairly enforced. U.S. Treasury officials are already trying -- with limited success so far -- to convince their counterparts in Europe, Canada and Japan that the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should provide business finance only to Russian regions that meet strict business-climate standards. ""Capital is basically only going to go to areas that are friendly,"" said U.S. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, who accompanied Mr. O'Neill to Russia. Both cabinet members were effusive in their praise of President Vladimir Putin and his willingness to improve Russia's business climate. Some Russian officials, however, are wary of singling out any of the country's 89 regions. Mr. Putin, trying to strengthen the central government, has emphasized uniformity in his approach to reform. And some earlier attempts to set up special economic areas -- sheltered from taxes or import tariffs -- ended up creating havens for money laundering and graft. The Bush administration faces a tougher challenge in winning Russian support for international negotiations aimed at cutting global steel supply by shuttering inefficient mills world-wide. The White House believes the initiative could prop up prices and help troubled U.S. steelmakers and their workers at a time when the U.S. president needs the support of congressional Democrats for his broader free-trade agenda. ""We are designing a global solution to a global overcapacity of steel,"" Mr. Evans said. ""We hope will be a very positive participant in that solution."" But, stung by recent U.S. steps to block steel imports, Russian officials remain privately suspicious that their industry would bear the brunt of any attempt by wealthier governments to cut production. In public, they say they are willing to participate in coming U.S.-led discussions aimed at identifying high-cost producers world-wide. ""But as regards the final settlement, I would say that we have to discuss it,"" said Maxim Midvidkow, Russia's deputy trade minister. ""It's too early to say if the U.S. formula is good or bad."" One reason for Russia's hesitance is that its private steel mills have been enjoying a boom in recent years, aided by the weakness of the ruble. Private companies will likely resist production cutbacks, and analysts say the government can do little to force them to comply.

61be355c-41d0-4890-b229-e06d5313fa4e,"30 /CNW/ - World Wildlife Fund Canada today urged Premier Dan Miller to protect 1million acres of BC's wilderness by Canada Day, 2000. The appeal came as part of a nationwide challenge by WWF to all of Canada's First Ministers to complete the protection of over 43 million acres of Canadian wilderness in the next seven months. ""With Canadian forests being cut at the rate of an acre every 13 seconds and 12,000 acres of land are staked for mineral claims every hour, Premier Miller needs to act decisively to ensure protection of BC's natural heritage in the new millennium,"" said Monte Hummel, President of WWF Canada. ""Recent protected area gains of eight million acres in Ontario and Manitoba illustrate how progress is achievable when political leaders move wilderness protection to the top of the political agenda,"" Hummel said. ""We're calling on Premier Miller to demonstrate this kind of leadership in British Columbia."" The 1million acres for BC represent the potential contribution of various candidate protected areas in two land and resource management planning areas: the Okanagan-Shushwap and Mackenzie . ""For many years, British Columbia was a national leader in wilderness protection,"" John Broadhead, B.C. Endangered Spaces Coordinator for WWF Canada, said. ""With the exception of the protection of the large site in BC's northeastern Rockies, that leadership has slipped dramatically in recent years. This is a good opportunity for Premier Dan Miller to regain that leadership role and ensure a tremendous natural legacy for future generations of British Columbians."" Recent public opinion polling demonstrates that there is strong support for protecting Canada's wilderness. A poll, conducted this month by Market Facts of Canada Ltd., indicates that 91% of Canadians believe that it is important for Canada's leaders to protect an additional 40 million acres of wilderness by July 1, 2000. In 1992, all senior governments in Canada signed the Tri-Council Statement of Commitment to complete a nationwide network of protected wilderness areas by the year 2000. The WWF-sponsored Endangered Spaces Campaign was organized to ensure that government commitments would be met, thus ensuring prospects for a healthy environment and economy. This survey of 1,002 Canadians was conducted by Market Facts of Canada Limited, during November 17-21, 1999. Percentages quoted are accurate to 4% plus or minus, 19 times out of 20. Footage of November 30th news conference, including comments by John Turner, former Prime Minister of Canada, as well as selected Canadian wilderness and wildlife footage will be distributed by satellite on Tuesday, November 30th from 14:00 - 14:30 .

fb35216a-d3a2-4506-b3b9-b985c76b99ab,"The 'New Nato' In May 1997, George A. Joulwan, a general in the United States army and supreme allied commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, paid the traditional farewell visit to Canada before relinquishing his official duties. In the nature of things, this was an occasion to show the flag for NATO, to review the state of play with the Canadian government, and to thank the Canadian forces for their support and co-operation. A burly, engaging figure, Joulwan enthusiastically presented the 'new NATO' to a meeting organized by the Atlantic Council of Canada. In direct, vivid language, he described how NATO was reaching out to its former adversaries -- to Poland, Hungary, Russia, and the whole array of countries that had once been encompassed by the Warsaw Treaty Organization . Of course, the 'new NATO' had kept the attributes that had enabled it to give its members political confidence and military security for over forty years, the firm base on which Europe's unprecedented half-century of prosperity, tranquillity, and freedom had been built. Given his audience, he did not need to spell out that the popular desire in central and eastern Europe for a similar measure of freedom and prosperity was what finally brought the cold war to an end. While the new NATO had not abandoned the vigilance and solidarity of the past, Joulwan was at pains to demonstrate that it now went well beyond collective defence. Through a series of special instruments devised for the purpose, NATO had reached out to Russia and its other interlocutors east and south of the Oder. It had initiated a deep, continuing institutional dialogue with those countries and, perhaps more important, had started to work closely with a number of them on matters of military management, including civilian control, training, doctrine, communications, equipment, and peacekeeping techniques. Joulwan took considerable and justifiable pride in how the new NATO programmes with their elaborate titles -- the North Atlantic Cooperation Council , Partnership for Peace, and Combined Joint Task Forces -- grew and developed during his time as supreme commander. They not only created a pool of common knowledge and a capacity to work together among the military forces involved, but, by fostering a habit of co-operation, they also helped to overcome the fears and suspicion of the past. Almost 30 non-NATO countries had missions accredited to NATO headquarters in Brussels with ready access to its senior managers, current thinking, and specialized programmes. Those missions were both means to achieve closer collaboration and symbols of growing ties. All this was quite impressive -- a series of measures that were working and held promise for the future. But when the bluff and confident general was asked how the enlargement of NATO would strengthen security and co-operation in Europe- specifically, what the addition of new members would contribute to the new NATO -- he was momentarily at a loss: 'Oh, that is a political question ...' He quickly rallied, affirming his support for NATO's official policy with standard words about 'extending stability' to central and eastern Europe. What he did not do was try to define the concrete benefits that would accrue to NATO members beyond those already conferred by the current outreach programmes. It was a telling moment. Joulwan's hesitation puts him in good company. Some specialists in Europe and the United States complain that these issues have not been sufficiently aired there, although their debates look very lively indeed compared to the relatively few voices raised in comment or advocacy in Canada. In fact, there is now an extensive literature on NATO expansion, in scholarly journals and general publications, in western Europe and particularly in the United States. What is striking about this debate is that a large proportion of the military and security experts, and many interested historians and students of politics, find little to commend in NATO enlargement. It is also striking that those in favour of enlargement have some difficulty in defining where the process should start and end and what the result will be. None of the sceptical assessments -- or the vagueness of expansion's exponents -- has had much effect on Canada's politicians and their chosen policy advisers. Other political leaders may have thought about the choices and harboured some doubts, but there have been few signs of serious reflection here. Taking the Longer View Meeting in Madrid in July 1997, Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, and his NATO colleagues committed themselves to a series of steps that will, over time, radically reduce NATO's capacity to take strong and concerted action. As enlargement proceeds, those steps may also set the politics of central and eastern Europe on a course that will breed division and difference in the years ahead. Chretien and his ministers clearly did not see the issue in this light prior to Madrid; their focus was on the here and now. But one must examine the decisions taken there in terms of what they mean for the future, and not just for today. In Madrid, NATO leaders committed themselves to admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO now and to adding further members later -- Romania and Slovenia, for starters, with some other Balkan and Baltic states to follow. In addition, they made it clear that NATO would cease to be a tightly knit collective security organization whose member-states are committed to common action, political and military, in the face of threats to international security that endanger any one of them. Instead, it will be transformed into an instrument of general reassurance and reconciliation akin, in some ways, to the Organisation for European Security and Cooperation , which operates by exhortation and moral suasion. The signals from Madrid also show, however, that NATO will continue to differ from the OSCE in some basic ways. First, while an ostensible rule of consensus applies in both bodies, NATO will continue to operate under strong American leadership and to reflect United States priorities in an unmistakable way. No one should need to ask why: the United States remains the one heavy lifter in the organization precisely because it still has the military capacity and, equally important, the political will, in given circumstances, to act and to intervene with deadly force. Meanwhile, some other members -- Canada foremost among them -- have forfeited much of their potential influence because they are unwilling to pay the political and military price for a meaningful place at the table. But that is a story with a long history. The second clear signal from Madrid is that NATO will never be an inclusive organization . It will keep outside its walls most of the Slavic countries which share the Eastern or Orthodox tradition, thus giving a tinge of plausibility to Samuel P. Huntington's controversial theories about an evolving 'conflict of civilizations.' Two grandly titled agreements, a Charter with Ukraine and a Founding Act with Russia, were endorsed at Madrid, but the grandiose tides do not obscure their main purpose. They were sops thrown to compensate for the fact that, while practical, day-to-day co-operation with NATO is already available to Russia and Ukraine through the programmes lauded earlier by Joulwan, they are out of the running where membership is concerned. The third signal from Madrid is that NATO will develop institutional links with certain Mediterranean countries that qualify for such treatment. One can imagine countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Malta, Cyprus, and Israel eventually benefiting from the co-operative programmes currently used in central and eastern Europe. This decision, which will undoubtedly be slow in execution, rewarded NATO's Mediterranean members for agreeing to eastward expansion and for accepting the additional budget charges involved. They now have their own project for 'extending stability' in their sub-region -- in effect, for fighting a dubious battle against radical Islam. NATO Going East: Doing the Wrong Thing for the Right Reasons? That NATO should pursue a vague and lopsided policy of expansion can hardly be regarded as a self-evident truth. It would be nearer the mark to say that expansion is a hopeful, well-meaning, but highly speculative -- and possibly costly -- venture. The proponents of expansion argue that it can be done on the cheap, and they are right. But you get the NATO you pay for: a frail instrument of collective security that may fail to respond with concerted action when put to the test. The figures are interesting: current cost estimates range from $27 to $130 billion for the alliance as a whole over ten years, depending on the assumptions one makes about membership and function. Estimates of Canada's immediate share range from $7 million to $30 million annually. Even the higher figure would add only some 20 per cent to the roughly $150 million spent annually to support participation in NATO. Even if all our NATO-related expenses come to $200-$250 million, that would hardly be a prohibitive amount in an annual federal budget of $180 billion -- a drop in the bucket, if the advantages to us warrant it. Faced with a vague, inchoate project and additional costs, why have governments gone ahead with such insouciance, in the absence of obvious need or public demand? The first reason usually cited is that NATO 'needs a new role' after the cold war, otherwise it will collapse. It is said that governments and electorates will not back NATO and, specifically, that the United States Congress will withdraw its support unless NATO does something that is visibly different and new. Cast in this light, the venture has a certain plausibility as a self-help project to ensure NATO's institutional survival. This may not be heroic but it makes sense in its own terms. By 'extending security' to selected democracies in central and eastern Europe, and by standing up to the -- also newly democratic -- Russians in the process , NATO's political leaders have been able to evoke a familiar pattern from the cold war era and to show, quite graphically; who won it. This stance is, of course, accompanied by avowals of devoted partnership with Russia -- outside NATO. These would have greater credence if they were matched by deeper and more evident concern for fostering understanding and practical co-operation among the countries of the region and by greater sensitivity to the possible consequences of making the Russians and their nearest neighbours perpetual outsiders. If the true aim is to foster a new kind of security co-operation and mutual support in the Euro-Atlantic region, and the game is institutional survival, why would Russia not already be a candidate for admission? The institutional argument may, thus, have some political force through its subtle appeal to atavistic cold war attitudes, even if it does not hang together very well in terms of international peace and security. Two other motives provide rather more down-to-earth explanations for the actions of NATO member-states. The first is the strength and character of the demand for membership from central and eastern Europe. The second is the response which that demand has evoked in the domestic politics and public conscience of western states. Visegrad Visions: Demanding Membership Poland's tragic and heroic history and the Polish people's singular, quasi-religious attachment to the Western world: together they provide one answer to the question of why NATO is going east. The demand for NATO membership has nowhere been as strong as it is in Warsaw. If the Poles had not insistently pressed their claim- as a moral debt owed to them by the West -- on every occasion that presented itself from 1989 to the present, it is most unlikely that NATO would be on the point of admitting three new members. The Polish claim is not new or unique, but it does carry particular weight. With a population approaching 40 million, Poland is almost as large as all the other former, non-Soviet, Warsaw pact members put together. It also occupies the most strategic ground, lying athwart the north European plain between Germany and Russia. Poland's impulse to 'go west' dates back at least to its division and disappearance from the map in the 18th century. The determination to build, and rebuild, ties with western Europe and the United States was, of course, immeasurably strengthened by the disasters that visited the country during the Second World War and the Soviet period which followed it. The resulting preoccupation with NaTO as a symbol of security and 'Western-ness' was curiously reflected in discussions I had with Polish strategic planners in 1987 and 1988, during the latter days of the cold war. Although they regularly accompanied their president and foreign minister to Warsaw pact meetings, in private they were more supportive of NATO and far more enthusiastic about Canadian membership in it than any Canadian I had met, apart from those working directly with NATO. They thought they saw its influence almost every day, as an indirect constraint on Russian behaviour, and they believed that it might have a further role to play in achieving and sustaining a Europe that would be free and open and no longer divided into armed camps. At the time, it was hard to credit these visions of sunny uplands ahead: they seemed to reveal an alarming level of naive optimism, if one did not dismiss them as cynical and disingenuous ploys. It was equally startling to come across Polish intellectuals such as Anna Wolff-Poweska at the Western Institute in Poznan who had the temerity to argue that Poland's 'western vocation' could be realized only through the unification of Germany. That was the price Poles would have to pay to 'rejoin the west,' and the possibility of such a choice was -- they predicted -- coming ever closer. Although no one could have known it, it was at hand. By backing Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms within the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact, and by conceding Solidarnosc's possible -- and then actual -- entry into government, Poland's political leaders were already making their choice. I suspect that for some the choice was more conscious than they could admit at the time. When the Berlin Wall came down in October 1989, Lech Walesa and his colleagues increasingly mustered the history and mythology of Poland -- Solidarnosc and the church on the ramparts -- to lay claim to NATO membership. Admission to NATO, they intimated , would be a guarantee of Poland's independence from Russia, a reward for Solidarnosc's strong defiance, recompense for the remarkable contributions Polish units made to the defeat of Adolf Hitler, and moral restitution for Poland's 'betrayal' by the West, that is, by the United States and Britain, at Yalta. Within Poland, the religious and nationalist right, the Western-oriented liberals, and the social democrats could all rally to this cry, whatever their previous history. Not that Poland is alone in pressing arguments of this kind for NATO membership. In Budapest, the 1956 uprising and its leadership in moving toward 'market socialism' and a freer system provide the moral coin. For the Czech Republic, betrayal by the West at Munich in 1938, the Prague Spring in 1968, and the ironic dissidence of its writers led by Vaclav Havel have established its bona fides, its moral claim to join the west by way of NATO. Together, the Visegrad Three have put forward a further argument and have created a bogey for the purpose. Their Western-backed efforts to implant democracy and free markets in their countries will be at grave risk and may well fail unless their own people and foreign investors have the reassurance that only NATO membership can bring. This may be a rather bold theory, given NATO's failure either to establish or to sustain democracy in some member states in the past -- see Portugal, Greece, and Turkey. Yet one could argue that the times and NATO have both changed. There is another side to this coin. 'Joining Europe,' becoming a member of the European Union, would confer far greater economic and political benefits on the Visegrad Three than membership in NATO ever can. That EU membership would solve the problem was for some time the unofficial American line. Certainly, many of the arguments used at NATO headquarters outside Brussels have also been heard at the Berlaymont, the EU's administrative centre downtown. Yet the response has been different. While the solidly entrenched EU has seen little need to rush ahead, existential fears at NATO headquarters have made it eager to embrace a course of action that promises, among other things, to keep it alive. Selling Membership in the West: The Politics of Expansion The Visegrad Three's parallel demands for membership have been consistent and strong. They are framed to appeal to the conscience of their friends in the West as well as to NATO's institutional self-interest. They have hinted at possible economic rewards. Expansion would not be pending now but for the shrewd and persistent efforts of the Polish, Czech, and Hungarian governments. Even so, neither uneasiness about NATO's future nor the claims voiced by the Visegrad Three explain why NATO is pressing ahead with enlargement now. If our political leaders have decided to act quickly, they have clearly done so for reasons other than concern for international peace and security. If instability and the possibility of conflict were real concerns, they would surely have paid greater heed to the substantial body of experts who hold that enlargement will weaken, not strengthen, security in the 'Euro-Atlantic' region. While the situation varies from one country to the next, it appears that domestic political calculations have shaped Western policy more than anything else. A number of the best-informed NATO leaders, for example the German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and his minister of foreign affairs, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, were initially sceptical about NATO enlargement. In the United States, it was not clear for some time how President Bill Clinton and his secretary of state, Warren Christopher, would react. In France, President Francois Mitterrand and his successor, Jacques Chirac, initially thought the EU and a purely European defence mechanism might do the trick. But the enlargement project, promoted by the applicant states and some NATO bureaucrats, caught press interest as new and in step with the times. No major voice proposed any clear alternative for dealing with the changed geopolitics of central and eastern Europe. In Germany, Volker Ruhe, the ambitious defence minister, embraced expansion to show that he and his supporters in the traditional, conservative CDU party were forward-looking, innovative, and capable of broader views. His advocacy drove the government coalition forward, particularly as it became clear that EU expansion would have to await the resolution of the prickly issues surrounding German integration and a common currency. Kohl's reputation and that of his government had suffered earlier over his hesitant and grudging acceptance of the postwar borders of eastern Europe. Backing enlargement thus became a way to validate Germany's benign role in central and eastern Europe, provided it could be squared with positive ties with Russia. It could be used to demonstrate that 'integration into Europe' still lay at the heart of German statecraft. In the United States, Clinton's choices were clear as the 1996 presidential elections approached. There were few votes to be won by opposing expansion and seeking other ways of working with the countries of central and eastern Europe and with Russia. Residual fear of Russia made 'denying it a veto on NATO expansion' an attractive move. More important, in electoral terms, the Visegrad ethnic vote was a potent force in a number of states. Promising early Polish, Hungarian, and Czech accession was the obvious way to secure that vote. The Polish vote was the main prize when Clinton made his policy declaration in Detroit on 23 October 1996, but the backing of the Hungarian community in the United States was also worth a special effort. To his credit, Clinton has been rigorous and logical in carrying out his commitment. At Madrid, knowing the possible pitfalls ahead , he staunchly and prudently insisted that only the three countries with the broadest support and the best cases should be invited to apply for membership. With those three and no others -- on the table, he will have the best possible chance of reassuring Congress about the cost, security consequences, and coherence of what he is proposing. Canada: Peace on the Cheap? Similar factors have influenced Canadian attitudes within a generally indifferent public. The support of interested ethnic communities and the broad if shallow appeal of policies that are described as conciliatory and forward-looking have created a climate that favours expansion. Here, too, recollections of the Soviet past and horror stories about the Russian present have played a part. By now, the only thing that could shatter the Canadian public's calm acquiescence in NATO enlargement would be a greatly increased defence budget to pay for it. But no minister in the present government would dream of proposing such a thing. Despite the public's general lack of interest, it is strange to see how expansion has been promoted and where active support for it now lies. The new approach to international security has been proposed as a means of adjusting to new realities. Its spokespeople have happily made the case -- sometimes overtly, more often by implication -- for changing NATO's character in the course of changing its membership. Indeed, the one implies the other. What is promised is that NATO will no longer be a harsh military and political alliance, led by militaristic American generals, brutally standing up to a brutal enemy. Instead, it will become a kindly, conflict-resolution centre, open to co-operation with all worthy partners. The 'new NATO' which emerges from the chrysalis of the old will not worry the Russians even if they are excluded from it in perpetuity- because it will be such a friendly, inoffensive body. Russia's exclusion will, at the end, be meaningless, a harmless political gesture because it will not have any security consequences. This is the mildest of caricatures of what has been argued: it is Canada's policy today and the philosophy that lies behind it. This vision of a world in which history has come to an end and the serious use of force is no longer contemplated is strangely shared by two quite different groups in Canada. On the one hand, the analysts who invested the cold war with great significance are now deprived of its insistent logic and feel that all has changed in the contemporary world. On the other hand, activists who questioned Canada's membership in NATO now welcome a transformed NATO with a new mandate. Both groups were represented among the Liberal intellectuals and activists who put together the Canada 21 document to guide our latest foreign and defence policy reviews. The pending changes in NATO give both satisfaction. Under Chretien and his minister of foreign affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, they will have a NATO they can love: one that costs little and downplays the actual and potential use of force in favour of conflict resolution and peacekeeping. A False Bill of Goods? The truth is, however, that NATO cannot have it both ways. It cannot be a staunch defender and guardian of security and an international conciliator and mediator. As David Haglund points out, NATO is moving from collective security to co-operative security: it cannot be an instrument of both simultaneously. Enlargement will change NATO's role and function and is a political sine qua non for the transformation of NATO: without it, altering NATO's basic character would command little interest and might well hasten its demise. Hardly anyone in the media has mentioned it, but one of the anomalies of including the Visegrad Three is that for the first time a member of NATO, Hungary, will not be directly accessible to the rest of the alliance by either sea or air. To get there, NATO forces will have to cross or overfly Slovakia, Austria, or Slovenia; Hungarian forces will have to do the same if they are to join NATO forces elsewhere in Europe. While it is true that NATO has no intention of permanently stationing forces in Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic -- that itself is a sign of the times -- joint training and exercises are essential for effective military collaboration. So, what will be done if joint exercises are to be held in Hungary? Or in the event of a security crisis requiring NATO troops? I recently posed the question to an official responsible for NATO affairs. The answer was that Hungary's isolation was one reason Chretien wanted Slovenia to join NATO at the outset -- it would have provided a physical link. Still, there was no great problem. NATO would surely be able to prevail upon officially neutral Austria or Slovenia, a pending applicant, for transit rights. The Slovak Republic, we agreed, was a less certain bet. A droll way to run an alliance: NATO would rely on the kindness of non-members! No stationed troops also means that no nuclear weapons will be placed on the territory of the new entrants . This, it is said, will help to reassure Russia and the Visegrad Three's immediate neighbours. Yet it makes it even less clear what the new entrants will get from membership that they would not get from continued participation in existing NATO programmes. The security guarantee is the usual answer -- the one feature that distinguishes membership from non-membership. Joseph Joffe, a notable German commentator, has pointed out, however, that the words in article v of the treaty are rather vague. What has given the security guarantee its force is the political culture and, even more, the entire military infrastructure of NATO: a unified command under SACEUR, the forward stationing of forces, a common doctrine and concerted nuclear strategy, standardized equipment, and demonstrated co-operation in training and exercises. The changes taking place in NATO in the military field and the new political culture which is evolving as part of the on-going transformation of NATO are already undermining the traditional security guarantee. Imagine Canada's response to an emergency. With no forces stationed in Europe to sustain and trigger our commitment, defence headquarters will be hard-put to find the resources -- troops, money, or equipment- with which to respond in our scaled-down military establishment. Ministers will lack the resolve to take quick decisions, to change course abruptly, to spend money. The opposition parties will clamour for parliamentary debate and a thorough review by a parliamentary committee before troops are sent overseas. Some months later we might be in a position to make a modest contribution, which might by then be irrelevant. For Canada, NATO's European trip-wire has frayed beyond use. Similar scenarios would probably apply with respect to some other members of NATO. And how great will be the resolve of those members which still have operational forces, notably the United States, as their alliance partners shuffle their feet? It is hard to say. One may be sure, however, that as co-ordination of effort and commitment decline within NATO, the security guarantee will mean less and less -- and that Canada will lead the retreat from it in practical terms. One may frame a general maxim: the wider NATO membership now becomes and the more it turns to co-operative security, the weaker the ties that bind it together, the slower its decision-making, and the less certain its response. Its capacity to intervene collectively and to safeguard international peace and security has declined, is declining, and will continue to decline as NATO expands and changes its character. This must be disturbing to the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs, as it becomes more evident. NATO membership was to be the iron-clad security guarantee from Western Europe and especially the United States that they lacked at earlier stages in their history. They stand to be disappointed: NATO negotiators have tacitly acknowledged that. Knowing that NATO's commitment to the Visegrad Three will weaken as the alliance expands, they have extracted promises from Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic that they will not, after accession, block further applications for membership. A fine sign of trust and mutual confidence! So the Three are joining an organization which is gradually but steadily losing the qualities that made it attractive to them. If they are wise -- and they are a pretty shrewd crowd -- they will continue to focus on ties with the United States. The bilateral political leverage they have in Washington will be better insurance than membership in NATO. Slovenia's accession may ease Hungary's anomalous situation, but the addition of others -- Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic states, the Slovak Republic, and possibly others -- will surely weaken NATO's commitment not only to the Visegrad Three but to one another. The fact is that maintaining and strengthening the alliance's political and military co-operation, demonstrating its capacity to intervene promptly when required to do so , and, not least, carrying further the excellent programme of co-operation in which General Joulwan took such pride would be a better approach to 'extending stability eastward.' It would give us all the advantages we may gain from expansion without the problems and costs. So far as NATO is concerned, one may reverse Mies van der Rohe's dictum: More means less . The final irony is that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic would have obtained greater security protection from a NATO that excluded them than they will get from the NATO to which they belong -- a NATO that is changing its character and that will come to include more and more of central and eastern/eastern Europe. The Missing Link: Building Co-operation There are actual and potential threats to international peace and security in central and eastern Europe which arise from political and economic dislocation, cultural and religious differences, historical enmities and fears, racial discrimination, crime and violence. The OSCE, the Council of Europe, the Economic Council of Europe are doing what they can to foster co-operation and ameliorate differences within Europe as a whole. We hardly need an expanded NATO to do the same thing. Yet one important security dynamic, one important means of fostering collaboration, seems to be missing from this still-unsettled half- continent. There is no structure or organization or mechanism that induces or compels the countries of central and eastern Europe to work together, to address together their inter-related economic, social, or technical problems. Such a mechanism would enable the smaller countries to deal with Russia, the giant of the half-continent, and each other, in a multilateral setting. Since 1989, the countries of the region have been called, competitively, to Brussels to advance their collaboration with the Western world . Clients have flocked to these twin and in some ways competitive poles of attraction. They could not afford to do otherwise. None of these bodies has done much, however, to foster bilateral and multilateral co-operation among the countries of central and eastern Europe whose many common interests and problems require concerted action. Since the welcome collapse of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the Warsaw pact, sorry instruments of Soviet domination, their inter-relations have been left to bilateral discussions, where the larger power normally has the upper hand. If we are genuinely interested in promoting Euro-Atlantic security, few things are as important as gradually building a new and equitable system of practical collaboration among the countries of central and eastern Europe. There are no ready models to follow. The OEEC, the OECD's forerunner, the EU and its predecessors , and NATO itself did the job for Western Europe when it was under reconstruction and badly in need of mechanisms to foster reconciliation and co-operation. There is nothing like that in central and eastern Europe now, no body geared to current needs.'3 Sceptics may say that such quasi-regional bodies have no place in the immense half-continent east and south of the Oder, that all that is needed can be done indirectly by the West or by global bodies. The habit of co-operation grows out of working together; it must be nurtured, it is not a natural growth. Without it, central and eastern Europe will remain in flux, tense and unstable. As the West European example shows, institutionally fostered collaboration can be a powerful means of overcoming fears and building confidence within a region. There is an evident need for such institutional collaboration in a half-continent where almost all the countries that once were part of the Soviet Empire remain wary if not fearful of Russia's present and future intentions; where other historical resentments remain alive; and where signs of anger, fear, and resentment call forth anger, fear, and resentment in return. Creating an institutional base for practical co-operation among the countries of central and eastern Europe will, in the long run, do far more to 'extend stability eastward' than will adding a chosen few to a special Western club. This is the missing element in the Western programmes of assistance to the region. Western countries have failed to address this need because they have focussed too narrowly on the immediate profits to be made and the costs to themselves, rather than on the economic and security benefits that will flow from a central and eastern Europe that is not only dynamic but also a centre of co-operation at peace with itself. Not that it will be a simple task to find the right formula now. It would certainly have been easier to start down this road at an earlier stage: so many vested interests have been created by Western actions since the momentous changes of 1989-90. We have given many hostages to fortune. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , set up to finance the reconstruction and transformation of the region, was placed in marble, Attalian splendour at Canary Wharf in London. Multilateral aid co-ordination and economic policy co-ordination were, from the outset, dispersed among the G-24 in Brussels, the EBRD in London, and the IMF/IBRD in Washington, with the OECD in Paris holding a watching brief. It will be more difficult and costly to establish appropriate mechanisms for policy scrutiny and co-ordination within the region now and to place a significant share of the responsibility for them on the shoulders of the member countries in the region. But, if it can still be done, there will surely be ample rewards in the future. Could an institution or mechanism be framed that would be acceptable to governments and of sufficient weight to capture their interest and commitment? One that could readily interact with the major international institutions, in a situation involving cross-membership? Could one, for example, seriously think of an OECD-sponsored institution, backed by both the World Bank and the EBRD, in which member countries would consider the levels and allocation of outside funding, the needs and policies of individual countries, and- as required- the means of jointly facilitating such things as transport, communications, trade, and investment across the half-continent? Bureaucrats with parochial views in Washington and Brussels would surely oppose the idea; so would politicians concerned about winning contracts for companies in their own ridings. It would entail increased spending on the part of Western countries during its early years -- but no more than NATO expansion and perhaps less. Western states and multilateral financial institutions would have to make it worth while for the countries of the. region to sit and work together. The real pay-off-would come in home-grown solutions that work, in greater common effort, and in mutual support. The expectation would be that the evident benefits of collaboration, including better credit ratings and greater weight and cohesion in dealing with the financial houses of the world, would, over a short period, give the institution its own momentum. There may be better ways of proceeding. The real challenge is to get Western countries to examine seriously, in dialogue with the countries of the region, how practical co-operation within central and eastern Europe can be deepened and strengthened. If they really want to back peace, freedom, and democracy in central and eastern Europe, they will make this their priority -- call conferences, consider options, talk about it. To those who say this is a far-fetched dream and unnecessary, given existing institutions, one may pose several questions. How do you justify excluding half of Europe from bodies such as the EU, the OECD, and even NATO? Could we not save money and enhance our own security by investing some of our transitional assistance funds in a body designed to meet current needs while rationalizing those that have fading relevance? The OSCE and the Economic Council of Europe are among those that might be reviewed. Then Vilnius or Kiev or Budapest or Warsaw might become the operational centre for self-help and multilateral co-operation in central and eastern Europe; and co-operation within the region might, in some small way, balance the current, floating crap game that brings various sets of countries as mendicants to Brussels, London, Paris, Frankfurt/Bonn/Berlin, or Washington, but gives them no stake in working together and, indeed, subtly but powerfully divides them. None of this may happen, but in encouraging division and failing to foster co-operation in central and eastern Europe, we may be taking unnecessary risks. It is no bad thing to respond to the strongly held views of some members of your electorate. It is a highly honourable thing to respond positively to appeals from countries which have themselves fought tyranny and sought freedom, which have helped you in the past and now seek your assistance. But if you do respond to such claims, whether foreign or domestic, what you do should be designed to improve your partner's situation as well as your own. The Canadian government cannot be faulted for listening to the appeals addressed to it: what it needs to think about more deeply and seriously are the negative consequences of the policy it has embraced and how such consequences may be lessened or avoided. A former Canadian ambassador to Moscow, Peter Roberts, recently examined the negative consequences of expansion and reached his own conclusions as to what should be done. He makes an eloquent plea for Canada to leave an organization that will do more harm than good by its expansion, that will sow dissent in the region, not 'extend stability' to it. One aspect of his argument merits special attention. If one takes into account Russia's history and the current hardships faced by ordinary Russians, it does not take any great leap of imagination to understand why NATO expansion will add to the apprehension and disorientation which already exist within Russian society. Fine words and Founding Acts will not wipe away those fears. What is most dangerous, as many commentators have noted, is that expansion will strengthen the hand of the most chauvinist leaders in Russian politics and weaken the modern-day Westernizers in their midst. No one can predict or guarantee Russia's future. It is surely unwise, if not an act of folly, to provide a warrant for arguments that provoke real fear, particularly when there is no evident need to do so. We may come to regret it. One may, however, recognize the force of these arguments, even share Roberts' concern about a Russia marginalized as a permanent outsider, without accepting his conclusions. Leaving NATO would salve the consciences of a number of Canadians, but what else would it achieve? It would vex the United States and our closest partners in Western Europe, countries where we need as much credit as we can muster. It would weaken our claim to a seat with the G-7/G-8 economic powers. It would irritate and offend the applicant countries, which we have assisted since 1989 and which we are trying to develop as trade and investment partners. Initially, Russia might be quite pleased but, on mature reflection, its leaders would probably conclude that a pragmatic northern neighbour such as Canada would be of more use to them inside NATO. What leaving NATO would not do is start a Gadarene rush to abandon the organization. The greater danger is that our departure would go virtually unnoticed -- even in Bosnia, where we, like other non-NATO countries, would continue to contribute to the integrated operation as sympathetic outsiders. In short, we would lose influence and standing by leaving NATO. Why not consider some other steps that are open to us to modify or ameliorate an ill-conceived policy and that are consistent with the initiative suggested above? 1 Canada should lend strong, continuing support to NATO's outreach programmes to non-member states in central and eastern Europe. It should be prepared to invest additional resources in these programmes, including the specially designed mechanisms set up with Russia and Ukraine, with a view to breathing as much life into them as possible. Our aim in championing these measures will be to narrow the difference between membership and non-membership until it becomes insignificant. 2 Canada should urge Russia to make a case for membership in NATO, through a series of slow and discreet steps. It should work out a strategy for convincing its 'old NATO' partners that Russian membership is the logical culmination of the course on which Canada is now embarked and point out that an all-inclusive NATO is a better guarantee of security than one that perpetuates new divisions in Europe. Russia's inclusion would be the final and conclusive step in NATO reform, in changing it from a collective security to a co-operative security organization . The corollary of these steps, and of the security-building initiative outlined earlier, is to rationalize what is sometimes pompously called the 'new security architecture' of Europe. Savings in time and money are possible if otiose structures are either renovated and combined with one another or simply closed down. 3 Canada should think hard about the best way to fulfil NATO's crucial security functions once it loses the capacity, by expansion and conversion, to do them itself. Enabling the key countries of the old north Atlantic alliance to act with reasonable cohesion when the need arises -- to respond quickly and decisively in response to major security threats and, more important yet, to forestall such threats by the dissuasive force of their readiness and solidarity -- is still the best security guarantee that members and neighbouring non-members of this alliance can have. 4 Canada should upgrade and adequately maintain its armed forces so that they have the training and the means to carry out the functions demanded of them. It should examine an elegant way of 'reinserting' permanently stationed troops into Europe. 5 Canada should start thinking hard about the best ways of building cohesion and practical co-operation in central and eastern Europe. Options should be explored with NATO members and partners in the region. These policy alternatives do not constitute the best, the ideal, solution. That would be a non-enlarged, cohesive NATO that retains the capacity to act promptly and decisively and the resolve to do so; and which also reaches out vigorously to all of central and eastern Europe through the new NATO, through Partnership-for-Peace and the other programmes developed since 1990.. That road is no longer open. The recommendations outlined above point toward an attainable second-best, one that avoids the dangers of our present course. Notes See International Journal 50 in which there are two articles strongly supporting expansion and one that is explicitly critical of it.

The most solid examination of the issues does not seem to have won much favour with the government's policy advisers. See David Haglund, ed, Will NATO GO East? The Debate over Enlarging the Atlantic Alliance . Haglund's thoughtful review of NATO'S future in the summer 1997 issue of International Journal came too late to have any bearing on discussions at the July 1997 NATO summit in Madrid. Strictly speaking, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited 'to begin accession talks with NATO' at Madrid. That the talks held during the autumn of 1997 would succeed in defining mutually acceptable protocols of accession was a foregone conclusion. The protocols were signed at the NATO Foreign Ministers Meeting in Brussels on 16 December 1997. Assuming they are ratified by the member states, formal accession will take place in 1999; the timing is being given some symbolic importance as it will enable the Visegrad Three to take part in NATO'S 50th anniversary. The symbolism will be read rather differently in Moscow than in Visegrad or Western capitals. 'The Madrid Declaration of Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation' is a 5000-word document which espouses many kindly causes rather along the lines of a comprehensive United Nations resolution. No single phrase can capture its intent, but it is worth noting that in the last substantive paragraph NATO'S goal is given as 'building co-operative security in Europe.' In the same paragraph, its part in promoting peace and prosperity in Europe is given pride of place over its part 'in meeting the security challenges in the times ahead.' Major declarations involve compromises among many authors and often acquire a certain windy grandeur. This one sets a new standard for communiques issued by the new NATO. Chretien's rueful comments before an open microphone in Madrid bore witness to this reality. See 'Chretien's wisecracks overheard,' Globe and Mail , 10 July 1997. Brian Mulroney's withdrawal of Canada's last permanently stationed troops from Europe was only the final step -- later vaunted, strangely, by David Collenette when he was minister of defence -- in a story that goes back to Trudeau's efforts to retreat from Canada's military and political commitments to NATO. Our solid but modest contribution to NATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia provides some substance for our continuing membership, but it can neither compensate for nor reverse the effect of those earlier decisions. Anna Wolff-Poweska, ""'Przed przepwadzka do wspolnego domu"" -- Glod Europy' , Polityka ; 'Die Polen in geteilten Europa' , Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte , 2 June 1989; personal interview, 13 June 1989, Poznan. The article in Polityka, shortened by censorship, was the first Wolff-Poweska was able to publish in the Polish press. To a foreign observer, it was a notable sign of changing times in Poland. We now know that, by 1988-9, Erich Honecker and some of his colleagues in the German Democratic Republic feared that Gorbachev might deliberately or unwittingly sacrifice East Germany to save glasnost, perestroika, and improving relations with the West. It is, perhaps, not surprising that such disparate observers as Honecker and Wolff-Poweska should have glimpsed what was happening in central and eastern Europe long before Western analysts and foreign offices began to come to grips with it. Both had far more at stake. European Union leaders addressed the question of future expansion on 13-14 December 1997. Anticipating NATO'S signature of Protocols of Accession with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic by two days, they established a list of eleven possible entrants, six of whom they favoured for the first round of negotiations-Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia, and Cyprus. Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister of Slovenia -- the best bet for early accession -- looked to possible accession to the Eu in 2002. While one cannot foresee how the process will unfold, it seems very probable that the EU'S main energies will be devoted to monetary integration in the coming years. This will be a crucial and absorbing task until the millennium. Once it is complete, the addition of new members will, no doubt, move up on the agenda. Only a forthright commitment to a timetable for accession could add to his political support at this point in the campaign. Earlier assurances that NATO expansion was 'no longer a question of whether, but when and how' had not spared him from criticism. 'President Clinton Address to the Polish Parliament,' Federal News Service, 7 July 1994. See also 'Clinton offers Poland hope, but little aid,' New York Times, 7 July 1994, 9. Canada 22: Canada and Common Security in the Twenty-first Century . As speculation about NATO expansion spread, Austria's chancellor, Viktor Klima, reiterated that his country would not seek to join any military alliance . Nevertheless, the debate about membership continues in Vienna. It was cited, in classic terms, by Clinton during his speech in Detroit in 1996: 'an attack on one is an attack on all.' Madeleine Albright has been quoted as saying that: 'The new NATO can do for Europe's east what the old NATO did for Europe's West.' So long as the new NATO divides rather than unites Europe's East, that is patently wrong. Peter Roberts, Globe and Mail, 19 July 1997. Roberts took as a foregone conclusion that the United States Senate will endorse the entry of the Visegrad Three into NATO, and that no other NATO member will prevent their entry. Given public attitudes in the United States and Clinton's deft management of the issue, he was surely right to see this as a done deal. If the deal does, surprisingly, fail, then a Western initiative to strengthen co-operation in the region will, for obvious reasons, become all the more timely and appropriate. The Russians are naturally listening to neighbouring voices, too. Although their sentiments are totally at odds with the policies and outlook of Poland's current government leaders, there are Poles who say 'Wait until we are in NATO: then we will show the Russians.' Similar attitudes may be found in Hungary, although they are disavowed by the government there, as in Poland. While it is a great exaggeration to cast NATO expansion as 'a new Versaille Treaty,' as some have done in public debate, the parallel does provide food for thought."
5fd3dccb-2537-4803-bebc-949dab80f032,"Text of report in English by Japanese news agency Kyodo Tokyo, 15 December: Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi on Monday reiterated Japan's call for Russia to build a crude-oil pipeline in line with a Japanese proposal it says would help Russia increase its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, Japanese officials said. Kawaguchi made the call in a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov who arrived in Tokyo for a three-day visit to Japan earlier in the day. Kawaguchi and Kasyanov agreed on the importance of boosting bilateral trade and investment, while discussing other issues including Iraq's reconstruction, North Korea's nuclear arms programme, and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the officials said. The two also agreed that Kawaguchi will visit Russia in the first half of next year to accelerate talks on a bilateral peace treaty, they said. On the pipeline project, Kawaguchi was quoted as telling Kasyanov that adopting Japan's proposal would help Russia develop natural resources in eastern Siberia and strengthen its relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan has urged Russia to build a pipeline linking Angarsk near Lake Baikal and Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan coast, and said it would provide loans to Russia if it accepted the Japanese proposal. China, however, has put forward a competing proposal, urging Russia to built the pipeline to Daqing, an inland city in Heilongjiang Province that is closer to Angarsk than Nakhodka. Kasyanov responded he will explain Russia's stance to Japanese officials as well as business leaders. He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Shoichi Nakagawa on Tuesday. It is Kasyanov's first trip to Japan since he became prime minister in May 2000. Koizumi and Kasyanov, who is in charge of Russia's economic affairs, are expected to issue a joint statement on bilateral relations, covering economic cooperation and other broad areas, and two other documents on trade and illegal fishing, the officials said. The Russian prime minister also plans to meet Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, Tasuku Takagaki, head of the Japan Association for Trade with Russia and Central-Eastern Europe, and executives of Japanese energy-related companies. Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Seiji Murata told reporters earlier in the day that no final decision will be made on the pipeline project during Kasyanov's visit to Japan and said the focus is on how the joint statement to be issued will refer to the matter. Kawaguchi and Kasyanov, meanwhile, agreed on the need to boost bilateral trade further, and basically agreed to set up an institution to promote bilateral trade and investment, which is aimed at increasing Japanese investment in Russia, the officials said. The establishment will formally be endorsed at the meeting between Koizumi and Kasyanov. The entity will provide information on Russia's investment climate, offer consultation services to potential investor firms and help firms prevent and deal with commercial disputes. Kawaguchi also renewed Japan's call for Russia to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global warming, saying Russia holds the key to the pact being implemented and that ratifying the pact would be in Russia's interest, the officials said. Kasyanov, however, made no response to Kawaguchi's request. Russia's ratification of the pact is crucial for its implementation now that the United States has walked out on the treaty. Kawaguchi also told Kasyanov that it is important for the international community to be united to assist in Iraq's reconstruction following the capture of former Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, the officials said. She said Japan will dispatch Self-Defence Forces troops to Iraq for its reconstruction and that it is important for Russia to promote its contribution for Iraq's rehabilitation, they said. Kawaguchi also told Kasyanov that Japan hopes to cooperate with Russia to achieve an early resumption of six-way talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. China, Japan, North and South Korea, Russia and the US have been seeking the talks' early resumption, but it is unlikely the talks will be held by the end of this year.

bd5a8f65-d96f-4c8e-abd6-fcf9f4cd38a5,"Text of report in English by Japanese news agency Kyodo Moscow, 4 October: Japan's vice minister for global environmental affairs, Hironori Hamanaka, has urged Russian officials to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global warming, Japanese officials said Friday . Hamanaka, who was in Moscow to attend the World Climate Change Conference, made the appeal in meetings with Mukhamed Tsikanov, vice minister at the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade; Vladimir Grachev, chairman of the State Duma committee on ecology; and other Russian officials. Ratification by Russia is key to put the Kyoto Protocol into effect, as the United States has abandoned the treaty. The treaty, adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 would go into force 90 days after it is ratified by 55 nations representing 55 per cent of industrialized countries' carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. Hamanaka told a news conference on Friday that Russian government agencies involved on the environment agreed on the need for ratification, but none of the Russian officials he met mentioned a specific time table. Addressing the World Climate Change Conference on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia will decide on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of its national interest.

725d36fc-b86c-4bdd-8a1e-d33ca856fb68,"Oleksandr Gladkyy is an Edmund S. Muskie Fellow in international affairs at Southwest Missouri State University, in Springfield. The White House's ""National Security Strategy for a New Century"" names three categories of American national interests. 1 The first is vital interests, which include the physical security of American territory, the safety of American citizens, the economic well-being of American society, and the protection of critical infrastructures from paralyzing attacks. According to the security strategy, to defend vital interests, troops ""might be used unilaterally and decisively."" The second category consists of important national interests that do not affect national survival but do influence national well-being. For instance, protection of the global environment, elimination of crises in the regions where American interests are the greatest, prevention of refugee flows, and commitment to allies are in this category. The third category includes humanitarian and other interests, whose basis is American values. These interests include responding to natural disasters, promoting human rights, and supporting democratization and the rule of law. It is evident that the 11 September terrorist attacks, which killed more than three thousand innocent civilians on American soil, shaped the most important category of U.S. interests: vital interests. 2 As a result, we can see changes in U.S. domestic and foreign policies that emphasize U.S. security. Bush has declared that ""he Government of the United States has no more important mission than fighting terrorism overseas and securing the homeland from future terrorist attacks."" 3 The United States today pays major attention to security, implementing both domestic and foreign policies to protect U.S. citizens from possible attacks by terrorists and rogue states armed with weapons of mass destruction . The Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the recently established Office of Homeland Security and Department for Homeland Security are the main agencies that protect Americans through enforcement of domestic policy. The Office of Homeland Security, whose mission is ""to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks,"" was established by the president's order in October 2001. 4 The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the Department for Homeland Security in January 2002 to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism at home, and minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from any attacks that may occur. 5 Furthermore, $37billion was devoted to homeland security in the proposed 2003 budget, twice the amount that has been dedicated to this type of security in the past. Twenty-eight percent of that money is to be spent for securing U.S. borders, 18 percent for funding outside initiatives by the Department of Defense, 16 percent for defending against biological terrorism, and 13 percent for ensuring aviation security. 6 The U.S. State Department is the main institution that protects American citizens through foreign policy, by creating the antiterrorist coalition, facilitating cooperation with important allies in the war against international terrorism, and cooperating with the United Nations to disarm rogue states. The change in U.S. national interest in security after 11 September has also affected U.S. foreign policy. The Department of Defense's new strategy for America's defense is just one of the tools through which the change has been implemented. The strategy's premise is that America, to be effective abroad, must be safe at home. 7 That denotes the dominance of security issues in American foreign policy. At the same time, U.S. defense policy will not overshadow foreign policy because ""the nation can be safe at home only if it is willing and able to contribute to effective security partnerships abroad."" 8 Official U.S. policies toward Russia and China have also changed, the result of a shift in defense planning from a ""threat-based"" model to a ""capabilities-based"" model. 9 The Department of Defense's new model focuses more on how an enemy might fight rather than who the adversary might be or where a war may occur. This shift implies that the United States is more likely to view its past adversaries Russia and China as partners, and that the United States will be more concerned with security than other fields of cooperation with these countries. President Bush argues that terrorism is a permanent condition of today's world; it is an inescapable reality of life in the twenty-first century. Fighting terrorism--namely, defeating Al Qaeda as well as every other terrorist group in the world--is a long-term goal and priority for the U.S. government. In his address to Congress on 20 September 2001, Bush stated, ""Our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated."" 10 Because the war on terror is ""a struggle of uncertain duration"" and the vital interests of the United States are at stake, I would argue that the recent changes in U.S. foreign policy are enduring ones. Let us look at the dynamics of U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations after 11 September, as well as areas of cooperation and disagreement between these states, to see if there has been a major change in relations, not just official policies, and whether this change has been beneficial. U.S. FOREIGN POLICY TOWARD REGIONAL POWERS Because governmental officials tend to call the public's attention to cooperation and because some analysts tend to speculate over certain disagreements, I am going to artificially break down U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations into areas of cooperation and conflict, to emphasize both sides of the relationship and to see the broadest view of the picture. Thus we can avoid downplaying either of these two sides of the relations and see both the current and potential benefits from cooperation as well as the present and potential dangers from areas of disagreement. This comprehensive view will allow us to see the real state of U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations. In reality, cooperation and disagreements are not separated from each other, but are closely interlocked. Furthermore, they are usually dynamic, and as they increase or decrease in importance, so does their positive or negative influence. THE SHIFT IN U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS TOWARD GREATER COOPERATION Since 11 September, common interests have prevailed over disagreements in U.S.-Russia relations, especially in the official policies between these two states. After Bush's first meeting with President Vladimir Putin on 16 June 2001, the Russian president noted that ""Russia and the U.S. are not enemies, they do not threaten each other, and they could be fully good allies."" 11 Bush shared this point of view and emphasized that Russia ""can be a strong partner or friend; more than people could imagine."" 12 The U.S. president was convinced that both states must establish a new, more cooperative relationship, leaving behind the cold war mentality to deal together with the problems of the twenty-first century: the energy crisis, poverty, and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Both presidents liked each other personally, and this first meeting may be seen as the beginning of new relations between the United States and Russia, mainly in the security sphere. After 11 September, U.S.-Russia relations intensified and became mainly focused on international terrorism and the war in Afghanistan. American interest in Russia was obvious, because the latter nation was very familiar with Afghan terrain after fighting the Afghan war in 1979-89. Furthermore, Russia retained its influence in most former Soviet Central Asian republics, whose territory, military bases, and assistance were necessary for the U.S. war against terrorism. Putin did not object when the United States asked the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for access to their military bases. Russia was interested in cooperation because of its similar problems with Chechen terrorists, and because maintaining its influence in the Asian region was possible only through participation. Furthermore, they posited that the ""spillover effect"" might increase economic and other types of cooperation between both states. Consequently, Russia ""provided political support and technical assistance for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan"" 13 and became an important ally in America's war there. To contribute more to the war in Afghanistan, Putin opened Russian air space to American humanitarian and support flights and shared intelligence with Washington. The Russian president ""gave the green light to the former Soviet Central Asian republics to allow U.S. military forces to stage bases there."" 14 In addition to cooperating in South Asia, the countries are working together to resolve conflicts in Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, and the Middle East. Another example of rapprochement is the U.S.-Russia Working Group, which has met regularly on eliminating terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan. The United States and Russia agreed that if Afghanistan moves toward reconstruction, ""they will continue to respond to the humanitarian needs of vulnerable Afghans and to promote the safe return and sustainable reintegration of Afghan refugees and displaced persons."" 15 In addition to their counterterrorist cooperation, Russia and the United States have also collaborated to battle against narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, and organized crime. Russia is also seeing increased cooperation with NATO. NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said, ""More then ten years after the end of the Cold War, at the start of the 21st century, the NATO-Russia relationship must evolve into a true strategic partnership."" 16 It would be unfair to state that there was no cooperation between Russia and NATO before. Russia joined the Partnership for Peace Program in 1994 and signed the NATO-Russia Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation, and Security in May 1997. 17 However, NATO-Russian relations were frozen because of the NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo. In the middle of 2001, these relations started to recover, as evidenced by a 6 June memorandum about establishing the NATO Information Office in Moscow. Nevertheless, it took the terrorist attacks to create a breakthrough in Russia and NATO relations and to eliminate outdated cold war stereotypes. According to a joint statement, the Permanent Joint Council was established in Brussels on 7 December 2001 to enhance Russia and NATO's ""ability to work together in areas of common interest and to stand up to new threats and risks to security."" 18 The council has tasked its ambassadors with exploring and developing, in the coming months, ""new, effective mechanisms for consultation, cooperation, joint decision, and coordinated/joint action."" 19 Russia and the alliance are supposed to meet on a regular basis to work jointly on security issues: crisis management, nonproliferation, arms control and confidence-building measures, theater missile defense, search and rescue at sea, military-to-military cooperation, and civil emergencies. Consequently, Russia has been given a voice in NATO, but not a veto. Then, on 20 March 2002, the Russian Federation and NATO signed the agreement to found the Information Center for Consultations and Studies in Moscow. 20 The center will be opened by the Russian Ministry of Defense and will deal with the adaptation of retired military personnel to civilian jobs. The establishment of new relations between the former adversaries Russia and NATO is unprecedented. Russia has not yet applied to join NATO, but what we see is rapprochement between Russia and the alliance. Furthermore, the relationship allows the United States a new way of cooperating with the Russian Federation in ensuring Euro-Atlantic security. In response to Bush's moves toward further U.S. cooperation with Russia, Putin has called for closer cooperation with NATO and announced the withdrawal of Russian forces from the last two major overseas military bases--the electronic eavesdropping base in Cuba and the Cam Ranh Bay Naval Base in Vietnam. 21 Although the main reason for closing the bases was the lack of financial resources, the action and timing facilitated U.S.-Russia cooperation. The Joint Declaration between the United States and the Russian Federation was signed in Moscow on 24 May 2002. This document declared that the relationship between the two states should be based on friendship, cooperation, common values, trust, openness, and predictability, so that they may respond to new challenges and threats and thus contribute to creating a peaceful, prosperous, and free world and to strengthening strategic security. 22 According to the declaration, the strengthening of mutual understanding and trust between the United States and Russia will also rest on a growing network of ties between our societies and peoples. Therefore, the United States and Russia should support growing economic interaction between the business communities of our two countries and people-to-people and cultural contacts and exchanges. The NATO-Russia Council has also been set up to further that aim. On 13 December 2001, President Bush announced the unilateral renunciation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. According to him, the treaty limited the capabilities of the U.S. government to establish new ways of defending the nation from further attacks by terrorists or rogue nations. 23 Russia remained committed to the treaty, and Putin considered the decision of President Bush to be a mistake. 24 The renunciation is not likely to hurt Russian national and military security, and according to Putin's official point of view, it will not be an obstacle in new Russian-U.S. relations. But it may weaken international stability. The treaty of 1972 was the primary instrument that started the process of disarmament and nonproliferation of WMD, which the United States is currently very concerned about. Bush's decision may lead to a new wave of arms races, challenging China and shaking international stability. During Bush's visit to the Russian Federation in May 2002, he signed the U.S.-Russia Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty, also known as the ""Moscow Treaty."" The treaty commits both countries to reduce their number of strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200, out of 6,000 deployed warheads for each side. 25 In line with the treaty, the states should finish the reduction by the end of 2012. On 12-15 November 2001, Putin visited the United States and agreed with Bush about new Russian-U.S. economic relations. Both presidents agreed on the following issues: Russia should further integrate into the world economy; the Russian Federation should enter the World Trade Organization ; the two countries should develop trade and economic cooperation; and they should continue to struggle against money laundering and financing of terrorism. 26 The presidents underlined the successful visit to Russia of American businessmen, who were accompanied by Secretary of Commerce Don Evans. Other examples of growing cooperation are the development of the Caspian oil pipeline consortium and the successful creation of the oil-gas project ""Sahalin-1."" As a matter of fact, the United States and the European Union have recently recognized Russia as a market economy, and they acknowledged that the Russian Federation is on its way to becoming a full-fledged member of the G-8. 27 Since 11 September, representatives of the United States and Russia have discussed economic cooperation at summits in Ljubljiana, Genoa, Shanghai, Washington/Crawford, and Houston. Despite these efforts and the creation of the U.S.-Russia Business Council in October (and Secretary Powell's saying in Houston that "" center of gravity of our relationship will shift--and should shift--toward issues of economics, trade, and investments"" 28), economic ties between the states remain weak. In 2001, the United States traded with Russia slightly more than with South Africa or Argentina. 29 U.S. imports of Russian oil have just started to increase. Despite the great potential of Russian raw materials and some growth of partnership between the United States and Russia on energy policy, energy cooperation is not developing as rapidly and intensively as security and military cooperation. In October 2002, the Moscow hostage crisis, when fifty heavily armed Chechen fighters took around eight hundred people hostage in a Moscow theater, affected not only the Russian people but also the rest of the world. During the rescue operation by the Russian Special Forces, more than 120 individuals died, but about 650 persons were saved. This event, which was similar to the terrorist attacks on the United States, is likely to unite the United States and Russia even more closely in the war against international terrorism. The official policies of the United States and the Russian Federation toward each other have changed tremendously since 11 September. Common interests have largely prevailed over disagreements, and the countries have become much friendlier. There is great potential for a beneficial change of the whole U.S.-Russia relationship. But although U.S.-Russia military relations have improved via cooperation in the war against international terrorism, Russia's more intensive participation in NATO, and reduction of nuclear warheads, military cooperation alone is not sufficient to stabilize the newly established U.S.-Russia relationship. Economic cooperation started to grow after 11 September, but that process is extremely slow, and the commercial relationship is more potential than real. Economic and other ties between the countries, which could make relations stronger and more stable, remain underdeveloped. The building of stable and reliable U.S.-Russia relations remains unfinished, in a transitional stage. THE SHIFT IN U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS TOWARD GREATER COOPERATION U.S.-China policy has had an important opportunity for development since the terrorist attacks. After 11 September, George Bush made two fruitful visits to China, and Chinese president Jiang Zemin came to the United States in October 2002. During Bush's first visit, the presidents agreed that the nations are friends and that they should work ""to develop constructive relations of cooperation."" 30 Bush also assured Jiang that he strongly supports China's entry into the WTO. The American president thanked China for its firm support and cooperation in fighting terrorism. The presidents agreed that their states are important partners in combating terrorism and that a medium- and long-term mechanism for antiterrorism cooperation might be established between both states. 31 Jiang told the press that although there are some existing differences, both China and the United States have extensive common interests. Consequently, they would hold high-level strategic dialogues and push forward exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, energy, and others. 32 During Bush's second visit, on 21 February 2002, the presidents agreed to actively carry out exchanges and cooperation in such areas as the economy, trade, science and technology, environmental protection, and prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. 33 They also agreed to call for three joint meetings on the economy, trade, science, and technology, to take place during the year. Bush emphasized that China is the most important country in the region, and maintaining close relations with China conforms to the national interests of the United States. 34 Especially since China became a full member of the WTO on 11 November 2001, 35 the United States is more interested in China as a full trading partner. During Jiang's visit to Bush's Texas ranch on 25 October 2002, the presidents addressed the crisis created by North Korea's admission that it has nuclear weapons. China agreed that its closest friend and old communist ally North Korea should abandon its nuclear weapons program. 36 In a joint news conference from Texas, the Chinese president said, The two great nations have extensive and important common interest and should expand cooperation and exchanges in various fields, including trade, culture and education, as well as dialogue in important international and regional issues to push forward the constructive and cooperative relationship between the two countries. 37 In 2001-02, China achieved many successes in its attempt to integrate into the world community, and the United States has contributed greatly to that. For example, Beijing received the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games. 38 Recently, China joined the WTO, fifteen years after beginning the process. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, which was held in Shanghai in October 2001, was the first meeting of world leaders on Chinese soil. Secretary of State Colin Powell, speaking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to outline the Bush administration's engagement policy, declared, ""A candid, constructive and cooperative relationship is what we are building with China: candid where we disagree; constructive where we can see some daylight; and cooperative where we have common regional, global or economic interests."" 39 This new U.S. policy is often called ""three C's,"" and it best describes current U.S.-China relations. Before 11 September, trade was the main form of cooperation between the United States and China. After the terrorist attack, cooperation in counterterrorism strengthened the ties between the two states. Although cooperation in such fields as science, technology, environmental protection, and prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS has slightly intensified, it remains weak. The United States and China have more common interests than differences, but they have become neither stable partners nor strategic allies. CONSTRAINTS ON U.S. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA In the previous sections, which were mainly based on government documents, I discussed newly changed official U.S. policies toward Russia and China and the resulting change in U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations. Although the documents have demonstrated beneficial changes in the official policies of the states toward one another after 11 September, they do not reflect the whole situation. In reality, it is still too early to state that U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations have become entirely cooperative and strategically stable and that the changes are long term. The actions of one nation, if they do not correspond with the interests and expectations of another country, become constraints on the foreign policy of the latter toward the former. Such restraints are obstacles to further improvement of U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations and prevent successful relations in one area from spilling over to another. Moreover, current barriers are dangerous because those issues have the most potential to become serious problems, preventing the further improvement of relations and even hindering already established cooperation. Despite growing common interests between the United States and the Russian Federation, as well as the United States and the People's Republic of China, and their generally positive attitudes toward one another, there are many areas of conflict between them. Some are just a legacy of the cold war, but other disagreements are new, dating since 11 September . However, both types of disagreements are a threat to forming new relations. Constraints on U.S.-Russia Relations TABLE 2. Constraints on U.S.-China Relations CONSTRAINTS ON U.S., RUSSIAN, AND CHINESE FOREIGN POLICIES Disagreements between countries can be a mutual constraint on their foreign policies toward each other. For example, nuclear confrontation, espionage and potential security threats, and trade disputes are problematic issues that have been inherited from the past and remain strong obstacles to the improvement of U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations. These areas of disagreements have been created mutually by two countries; therefore, the constraints may be resolved or minimized only by the mutual efforts of both states. Nuclear Confrontation During the cold war, the United States used its nuclear weapons to deter a potential Soviet attack on Western Europe and North America. Unfortunately, today nuclear confrontation remains strong between both the United States and Russia and the United States and China. These three states have the largest nuclear arsenals in the world; Russia controls the only nuclear arsenal that could destroy the United States. Of the three, the United States is the most concerned about the nuclear issue. The Pentagon report ""Nuclear Posture Review,"" 40 which was released in March 2002, and the congressional ""Report of U.S.-China Security Review Commission,"" 41 released in July 2002, identified China and Russia as potential military and economic rivals and nuclear targets for the United States. This is believed to be the first time that the United States has revealed a list of potential nuclear targets. Among new contingencies in which nuclear weapons might be employed are "" North Korean attack on South Korea and a military confrontation over the status of Taiwan."" 42 The report of the U.S.-China Security Review Commission said that China's economic and military growth would pose a national security threat to the United States, and it recommended a rolling back of bilateral cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade and high technology. 43 At the same time, the Pentagon report also stated that the United States might need to resume nuclear testing and argued for developing earth-penetrating weapons to destroy bunkers that might be storing biological or chemical weapons. 44 Recently, the Bush administration has refused to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and withdrew from the ABM treaty. Meanwhile, in March 2002, China announced a 17percent, or $3 billion, increase in spending for modernizing its military. China said it was ""deeply shocked"" by its place on the list of potential targets for U.S. nuclear weapons and by the U.S. intention to develop new nuclear weapons. Russia also reacted to the report with concern about both the list and the U.S. quest for a qualitative nuclear monopoly. Both China and Russia demanded explanations. Not surprisingly, the U.S. position was that it is not an enemy of Russia or China and that the report is not an ""operational planning document."" 45 Unfortunately, this has not resolved the issue of nuclear confrontation, and that concern remains acute for Russia and China. As we can see, nuclear confrontation did not go away with the cold war. Furthermore, there is a threat of another nuclear arms race and a resumption of nuclear testing if the United States starts implementing the recommendations of the ""Nuclear Posture Review."" China, like the United States, has not ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, so although the country adhered to the voluntary international moratorium and has not conducted nuclear testing since 1996, China will almost certainly follow suit if the United States resumes testing its nuclear weapons. Russia has ratified the treaty, but it remains capable of resuming full-scale testing and new weapons development and deployment if the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as a mutual deterrent should fail. The Moscow Treaty, signed between Russia and the United States in May 2002, does not help much to reduce nuclear confrontation because the treaty implies the reduction and limitation of only ""strategic nuclear warheads,"" 46 not tactical or nondeployed ones, which have also been amassed in huge numbers. Therefore, nuclear confrontation remains a strong enough issue to throw all three countries into a new arms race if any of them starts changing the established equilibrium, either to lessen their own vulnerability or to attain nuclear superiority over them. Espionage and Potential Security Threats Espionage is a problem inherited from the cold war that affects the United States, Russia, and China. In March 2001, the U.S. government expelled about fifty Russian diplomats working in the United States, whom it accused of being intelligence officers. 47 Despite the protests of the Russian government, all fifty diplomats had to leave the United States that spring. 48 It was the biggest such move since ""Operation Famish"" in 1986, when President Reagan expelled eighty Soviet diplomats. Similarly, on 28 December 2002, CNN announced that the Russian government would not welcome any more American Peace Corps volunteers because the Federal Security Service , successor of the KGB, charged some of the volunteers with espionage. According to FSB head Nikolai Patrushev, ""Among them are persons who were collecting information on the social, political and economic situation in Russian regions, on officials of governmental bodies and departments, on the course of elections and so on."" 49 Russian officials also deported a prominent American labor activist and the executive director of the American Center for Labor Solidarity, Irene Stevenson, who lived and worked in Russia from 1989 to 2002. 50 From time to time, the United States and China also charge each other with espionage. Not long ago, the United States accused China of stealing nuclear technology. 51 Subsequently, China detained an American writer and former teacher, Wu Jianmin, as part of a sweeping anti-espionage campaign. 52 In January 2003, U.S. authorities started to investigate whether Chinese state-owned companies or the Chinese government backed attempts at commercial espionage on U.S. soil. 53 In April 2001, a U.S. spy plane made an emergency landing on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, after a collision with a Chinese fighter jet. 54 As a result, China accused the U.S. plane of ramming its aircraft, although the United States said it was an accident. China released the twenty-four crew members only after President Bush said that he was ""very sorry"" that a Chinese pilot died in the incident. Regardless of the Russian Federation's protests against U.S. expulsion of Russian diplomats, and the dismissal of the charges as ""groundless"" by the Russian and Chinese Embassies, espionage is a problem for U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations. It undermines trust and creates a bad climate for the further development of positive relations. Trade Disputes The most recent example of a trade dispute between the United States, Russia, and China may be the ""steel war,"" which started in March 2002 and still continues. To protect the American steel industry, which has lost not only twenty thousand of 175,000 jobs but also some of its competitiveness to cheap foreign steel imports, in March 2002 President Bush approved tariffs on the majority of steel imported to the United States. Tariffs ranging from 13 to 30 percent were introduced on certain types of steel imported from fifteen countries, including Russia and China. 55 According to calculations by the U.S. government, 33 percent of Russia's steel exports to the United States were affected by the tariffs. The potential losses for Russian steel producers were estimated at $400-500 million. 56 Consequently, the Russian Agricultural Ministry banned the importation of chicken legs from the United States, citing health concerns. 57 As it turned out, it was good leverage against the United States because the Russian Federation is the biggest importer of American poultry, which is exported from thirty-eight U.S. states. Last year, U.S. producers reportedly sold about 1 million tons--or $700 million worth--of poultry to Russia. As a result of the ban, employees of the U.S. poultry industry faced possible lay-offs, and four states were about to experience the total cessation of poultry production, which would lead to mass unemployment. The Russian minister for economic development and trade, German Gref, came to the United States to conduct negotiations; as a result, Russian companies concluded an agreement with the Americans on 23 September 2002. Pursuant to that agreement, cold-rolled steel deliveries, the major component of Russian steel exports to the United States, were supposed to resume in April 2003. 58 China, whose steel exports also have been affected by U.S. tariffs, acted with other countries within the WTO. China and five other states filed formal complaints with the WTO against the United States and demanded compensation for losses by their steel industries. 59 Because the WTO's process of resolving trade disputes is lengthy, China also imposed sanctions on U.S. imports in March 2002. For example, China imposed tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 26 percent on nine types of steel products in a bid to prevent an import surge from damaging its steel industry. When a country decides to protect a national industry by imposing sanctions on imports of its trade partners, the affected countries usually react with countermeasures, imposing their own tariffs, quotas, or restrictions on imports. As a result, one industry may be protected, but several other industries may suffer. U.S. tariffs on steel imports from Russia and China, as well as other nations, created such a chain reaction. Furthermore, U.S. bilateral relations with Russia and China in other areas may also have cooled or even been damaged as a result of the ""steel war."" CONSTRAINTS ON RUSSIA'S AND CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICIES TOWARD THE UNITED STATES The United States should pay special attention to Russian and Chinese foreign policy constraints. First, because Russia and China share many complaints, reducing or eliminating disagreements will improve U.S. relations simultaneously with both Russia and China. Second, because the United States has aggravated areas of conflict recently through its unilateral behavior and its likely military actions against Iraq and North Korea, it has the main responsibility to address those disagreements. American Leadership and ""Unilateralism"" The Russian Federation is a successor of the world superpower the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China is a rapidly emerging regional superpower; therefore, the political elites of both countries oppose American leadership in today's world. U.S. unilateralism only increases opposition against the United States in China and Russia. NATO's attack on Yugoslavia in 1999, when the United States acted within NATO boundaries but without a Security Council resolution, is an example of such unilateralism. Similar may be the U.S. war against Iraq or a missile attack on North Korea. ""I am certain that unilateral actions would be a mistake,"" said President Putin, referring to a possible U.S.-led military strike against Iraq. 60 Another recent example of American unilateralism is U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, which has been the basis for international security and stability for thirty years. Russian and Chinese officials disagree with the U.S. decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty because it might lead to a new defensive arms race. 61 Furthermore, both the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China currently oppose the proposed U.S. deployment of a limited missile shield by 2004 because they feel that they would be its targets. President Bush's Intentions to Wage War against Iraq Vladimir Putin and Jiang Zemin are also strongly convinced that George W. Bush should not wage a war against Iraq without the approval of the UN Security Council. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov has said several times that Russia does not believe that Iraq has breached the UN disarmament resolution or that it has WMD. Although Russia and China share U.S. interest in demanding that Saddam Hussein fulfill his obligations to disarm, any U.S. military actions in Iraq will run counter to their national interests. Putin and Jiang disagree with both U.S. allegations of the existence of weapons in Iraq and Bush's intended method of resolving the problem. Even after 5 February 2003, when Colin Powell presented tape recordings, satellite photos, and informants' statements to the Security Council to prove his case that Iraq has defied international demands to disarm, Russia's position on Iraq has not changed. 62 The presentation merely reinforced Russia's belief that weapons inspections must continue in Iraq, according to Igor Ivanov. 63 China shares the same position and warns the United States to strictly abide UN resolutions and resolve the conflict by diplomatic and political means. At the same time, President Bush, who has sought Congress's support to use armed force against Iraq, pushes for military actions against the Muslim state and for the toppling of Saddam Hussein. After Russia officially stated that its concerns over Iraq are economic, President Bush hoped to resolve the issue by compensating Russia's potential economic losses in the event of a war with Iraq. 64 However, because Russia has geopolitical interests in the region as well, it is still questionable if the United States will be able to account for the potential Russia-Iraq economic agreements and the $7 to $9 billion debt that Iraq owes to the former U.S.S.R. Possible U.S. Military Actions against North Korea After North Korea officially declared in fall 2002 that it would resume operations of its nuclear facilities, and after it withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Comprehensive Ban Treaty on 10 January 2003, this ""axis-of-evil"" state became one of the major international concerns for the United States. Although Putin and Jiang share Bush's belief that the Korean Peninsula should be kept free of nuclear weapons, to ensure the security of the region and the rest of the world, Putin and Jiang disagree with Bush about the way to reach this goal. 65 China and Russia, both traditional allies of North Korea, are strongly opposed to any U.S. military actions against North Korea. ""We are convinced that these problems can be resolved through political, diplomatic, and economic means,"" said Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov, who added, ""We reject any attempts to exert military pressure on a sovereign state."" 66 China holds the same position on these urgent issues. Therefore, Russia and China are acting as mediators in U.S.-North Korea talks. The United States also wants Russia and China to play more substantial and positive roles in bringing Pyongyang to its senses through economic sanctions. In the worst-case scenario, a possible U.S. strike against North Korea will damage security in northeast Asia, which is within China and Russia's sphere of influence, as well as global security. Russia and China do not want nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula, but they even more strongly oppose a U.S. war against, and U.S. presence in, North Korea. Currently, the crisis with North Korea is just one area in which the United States disagrees with Russia and China; however, it may easily transform into a problem that aggravates cooperation between these states. CONSTRAINTS ON RUSSIA'S FOREIGN POLICY TOWARD THE UNITED STATES Constraints on Russian foreign policy toward the United States revolve around the following three elements: the inherited Jackson-Vanick amendment, growing eastward expansion of NATO, and the lack of reciprocal relations between the United States and Russia. The constraints may be eliminated in two ways: if Russia changes its attitudes, or if the United States changes its ways, by canceling the Jackson-Vanick amendment, using its influence to stop NATO's further expansion toward Russia's borders, and considering Russia's interests in its decision-making. The Jackson-Vanick Amendment Among the inherited constraints on Russia-U.S. cooperation are U.S. internal legal regulations. The Jackson-Vanick amendment, basically a relic of the cold war, is the most vivid example of them. This law, adopted in 1974, restricted U.S.-Russia trade because of the poor human-rights record of the U.S.S.R. and the limits it placed on emigration from the former Soviet Union. 67 The U.S.S.R. has dissolved and human rights have improved noticeably since then, but economic relations are still limited by the amendment. No doubt Russia's human rights record is not as good as that of the United States, but it has improved, even allowing freedom of emigration. Therefore, it is not reasonable to maintain this regulation, which prevents the development of new trade relations between the United States and Russia. Circumstances have changed, bilateral relations already have improved, and there is great potential for more beneficial cooperation in the economic field. NATO's Eastward Expansion It is a bit of a paradox that a country that has cooperated with NATO since 1994, that has obtained a voice in NATO through the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, and whose relations with the alliance have progressed remarkably in recent days, still opposes the eastward expansion of the alliance as in old times. During the NATO summit in Prague on 15 November 2002, top Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters that Moscow continued to oppose NATO's expansion as unnecessary. 68 The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, also confirmed Russia's standard opposition to NATO's expansion, and Putin said that NATO enlargement was ""not necessary."" 69 Lack of Reciprocal Relations between the United States and Russia American leadership also tends to create an imbalance in U.S. relations with other countries. For example, Viktor Kremenyuk, an analyst at Moscow's U.S.A.-Canada Institute, stated that Russia allowed U.S. troops into former Soviet states and accepted Washington's withdrawal from the ABM treaty, but the United States failed to respond in kind. 70 According to Kremenyuk, the Bush administration failed even to pressure Congress to lift the cold war-era Jackson-Vanick restrictions to somehow justify Putin's sacrifices and make him look good in the face of domestic opposition. As a result of disappointment over Bush's failure to return concessions made by Moscow over the past year, Putin increased Russia's cooperation with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The renewed connections between Russia and the ""axis-of-evil"" states are likely the first warning sign of Russia's dissatisfaction with the lack of U.S. reciprocity. Mutually beneficial relationships are the basis for long-lasting strategic cooperation. If one of the countries gives much more than it gets, it feels cheated. The leader of that nation will face strong resistance to the relationship from inside his own state. Putin currently faces this situation. As a result, U.S.-Russia relations cannot become stable and strategic because they are hindered by Russian politicians and officials who believe that their country sacrifices much more and receives much less than the United States does. Furthermore, the lack of reciprocal relations gives grounds to such skeptics as General Leonid Ivashov, who stated that the United States and Russia cannot be good partners because of their very different economic, military, and geopolitical interests. 71 Ivashov called Russia's move toward rapprochement with the United States ""an attempt at geostrategic suicide."" 72 Constraints on China's Foreign Policy toward the United States Taiwan has been the most important and most sensitive issue for China-U.S. relations. Because China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and wants to reunify with the island, the People's Republic of China opposes support for or weapons sales to Taiwan by any country, including the United States. 73 However, on this issue the United States has not pleased China. The United States did agree with the ""one China policy,"" according to which Taiwan is part of China. But in March 2001, the Bush administration increased its diplomatic support of Taiwan and dropped Clinton's ""three no's policy,"" which implied no support for Taiwanese independence; no recognition of a separate Taiwanese government; and no backing for Taiwanese membership in international organizations. 74 Furthermore, the United States sells weapons to the island almost on a regular basis. The Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II administrations have approved certain arms sales to Taiwan. Since 1990, the United States has sold weapons to Taiwan every year, with only some difference in the type and quantity of these arms and military equipment. 75 But George Bush breached this understanding significantly by approving the sale of 150 General Dynamics/Lockheed F-16 planes to Taiwan in 1992. Clinton approved the transfer of four Grumman E-2T airborne surveillance and tracking aircraft to Taiwan in 1993. The Clinton administration also sold Taiwan medium-range standard missiles, helicopters, frigates, Phalanx close-in weapons systems, Harpoon missile launchers, rockets, rocket launchers, guided missiles, satellites, battle tanks, machine guns, smoke-grenade launchers, tactical-communication systems, trainer and fighter aircraft, and cannons, for about $8billion. 76 The situation became urgent when the George W. Bush administration announced in April 2001 that it would sell advanced weapons and equipment worth $5billion to Taiwan, including four Kidd-class destroyers, eight diesel-powered submarines, and twelve P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircrafts. This was the biggest batch of arms sold to Taiwan by the United States since 1992. 77 Chinese vice foreign minister Li Zhaoxing said that the sale would seriously affect bilateral cooperation in nonproliferation and damage China-U.S. relations. He also noted that the Chinese government and people were extremely indignant at and firmly opposed to this decision by the U.S. government. 78 Surprisingly, increased cooperation between the United States and China in the war against terrorism has not changed much about the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and in early July 2002 the United States continued a partial sale. 79 The remaining weapons will be sold in the near future. The United States, which is the biggest world exporter of weapons and the leading arms supplier to Taiwan, justified arms sales to Taiwan by referring to the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which was reaffirmed by the U.S. House and Senate in July 1998. The act states, ""The United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."" 80 This gives the United States grounds to provide Taiwan with weapons and assistance, although it supports only peaceful resolution of intra-China disputes. 81 ""Taiwan is part of China,"" the spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, Xie Feng, recently said, ""so selling arms to a province of China is really an infringement upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" 82 Since China views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as interference in its internal affairs, this issue has the biggest potential to aggravate China-U.S. relations and may even lead to a direct military confrontation. CONSTRAINTS ON U.S. FOREIGN POLICY TOWARD THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA In part, constraints on U.S. foreign policy toward Russia and China relate to domestic problems of the latter two, such as the war in Chechnya, China's and Russia's poor human rights records, corruption, organized crime, and the lack of liberal democracies in either country. Another element of their conflict has an international character and has to do with Russia's and China's contacts with countries in the axis of evil. Although Russia and China are slowly but steadily resolving their domestic problems, their contacts with Iran, Iraq, and North Korea remain strong and have even grown. Only Russia and China themselves are able to resolve their domestic problems. But in the international scope, they should consider U.S. national interests while dealing with its rivals so that their relations with the United States may continue to develop. The War and Human Rights Abuses in Chechnya One of the central goals of U.S. foreign policy is the promotion of respect for human rights. 83 Russia has been conducting its second brutal war in Chechnya since 1999 without much respect to humanitarian law and human rights there. According to the Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the Russian federal security forces extrajudicially executed many Chechens and were involved in politically motivated disappearances. 84 Matters with Chechnya worsened when the Chechnya mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was closed on 3 January 2003, when its mandate expired and a new one was not accepted. 85 Even the October hostage crisis in Moscow has not changed the U.S. position on Chechnya; President Bush stated that this issue ""an get solved peacefully."" 86 Furthermore, the Russian Federation has a poor record on human rights as a whole. Government pressure on the media has increased and resulted in numerous restrictions on freedom of the speech. The government does not always respect the equality of religions. Violence and discrimination against women and abuse of children remain problems. Another serious problem is human trafficking, particularly of women and young girls. 87 Ethnic minorities such as Roma, persons from the Caucasus, and Central Asians are widely discriminated against and abused. Finally, torture, beating, and other abuses of detainees and suspects are regular in the Russian Federation. No wonder that the United States is troubled by the war in Chechnya and human rights abuses in Russia. 88 According to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Chechnya is ""the second concern"" that the United States has about Russia, after the spread of nuclear technologies to Iran. The United States supports Russia's territorial integrity but believes that Russian security forces must observe international standards in their operations in Chechnya. Furthermore, the United States believes that the solution to the current problem in Chechnya should be a political dialogue. 89 Human Rights Abuses and Domestic Repressions in China The situation with human rights in communist China is much worse than it is in Russia. This is an urgent issue over which the United States often criticizes Chinese leaders. The Chinese government continues to commit numerous serious abuses. For example, respect for religious freedom in China remains very poor, and there have been crackdowns against unregistered groups. Several leaders of the unregistered South China Church were arrested in July and subsequently sentenced to death; some of those sentences were suspended and some have been appealed. Other abuses include instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention, and denial of due process. Conditions at most prisons remain harsh. 90 Particularly serious human rights abuses persist in Tibet and in Xinjiang, where security has been tightened. The government of China maintains tight restrictions on freedom of speech and of the press and continues its efforts to control and monitor the Internet; self-censorship by journalists continues. Freedom of assembly and freedom of association are severely restricted. The government does not permit independent domestic nongovernmental organizations to monitor human rights conditions publicly. 91 The Chinese government also infringes on citizens' privacy rights by implementing a sometimes coercive policy to restrict the number of children a family may have. Corruption, Organized Crime, and Money Laundering in Russia and China Corruption remains a huge problem in the Russian Federation and China. The judiciary and police have been impaired by high levels of corruption, as pointed out by Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in 1999, 2000, and 2001. According to Transparency International's 2002 index of corruption perceptions, the Russian Federation scored a 2out of 10 , which is one of the lowest marks in Eastern and Central Europe. 92 The score of China is 3, which is a little better than Russia but still very low. According to the report of the Council of Europe's Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures, organized crime represents a serious threat to Russia. 93 Economic crime is said to have risen by 25 percent in the last four years. Cash smuggling across borders is known to occur, but more typically, money is laundered through the financial system, particularly via the large number of banks. The laundered money is then returned into the Russian Federation economy through investment in legal commercial business, the purchase of real estate, or the purchase of shares of enterprises, particularly through the privatization process. 94 According to the report, no anti-money-laundering system that would meet international standards has been established yet in Russia. These three internal problems, which are common to both the Russian Federation and China, are constraints on U.S. foreign policy because they prevent American foreign investments from flowing to their countries more intensively. This hurts the development of economic relations between the states. Russia and China need to better protect investor rights and uphold the sanctity of contracts to attract investments. Regimes in Russia and China Inasmuch as regime type represents the values of a nation, it affects U.S. cooperation with that nation. Democratic regimes and civil societies are the foundation for U.S. relations with the governments of other nations. Russia is a new electoral democracy. Regardless of its progress toward becoming a democratic regime and market economy, the Russian Federation retains some features from its totalitarian past. Among them is overly centralized authority, restrictions on freedom of the press, and a poor human rights record. According to the Freedom House Survey, which estimates political and social freedoms, Russia was on the threshold between ""partly free"" and ""not free"" in 2001 and 2002. 95 Despite economic decentralization and pragmatism, China is in transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. As a matter of fact, China remains an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount source of power and any political opposition to government is prohibited. Many persons are imprisoned for the nonviolent expression of their political views in China. According to Amnesty International, 211 persons remain in prison for their activities during the June 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. Political opposition is not allowed in China. For instance, since December 1998 at least thirty leaders of the China Democracy Party have been given long prison sentences on subversion charges. 96 Freedom House refers to China as ""not free."" 97 Although China has improved civil liberties since 1998, the political rights of the Chinese remain severely repressed. China's and Russia's Contacts with Axis-of-Evil Countries President Bush, in his State of the Union address on 29 January 2002, said that Iran, Iraq, and North Korea formed an ""axis of evil"" and that ""y seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred."" 98 Russia and Iran. Moscow's provisional agreement with Iran, signed in the 1990s, to help build five nuclear reactors in Iran irritates the United States greatly because the United States strongly believes that Iranians are not just interested in the peaceful use of the atom but are working on a weapons program, too. Therefore, the United States strongly opposes the spread of WMD and nuclear technologies from Russia to U.S. rivals. 99 However, the Russian Federation continues its nuclear assistance to Iran and is currently building a nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Not surprisingly, the United States is pressuring Russia to terminate the project or to take strict measures to contain the proliferation risk. To make matters worse, in August 2002 Russia announced that it had approved a new ten-year nuclear cooperation program with Tehran, which would include the building of another nuclear power plant in Ahwaz, one hundred kilometers from the Iraqi border. 100 The announcement stunned Washington, coming less than a month after it agreed to a confidence-building $20 billion aid package to help Russia dismantle its weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, Russia has not stopped the construction of another four reactors, and there is some evidence that ""ome Russian specialists are still helping the Iranians obtain the know-how for other parts of the nuclear cycle,"" said U.S. ambassador to Moscow Alexander Vershbow. Consequently, the United States wants Russia ""o crack down more effectively on other transfers of technology to Iran, both for WMD and for ballistic missiles."" 101 One of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's highest priorities has been ending Russian arms and technology sales to states that support terrorism, particularly Iran. 102 Similarly, according to Colin Powell, one of the biggest disagreements between the United States and Russia ""as to do with our very strong concern about Russian nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology that is still finding its way to Iran. The economic ties between Russia and Iraq run deep. Iraqi oil, traded in a UN oil-for-food program, brings Russian companies $4 billion per year. Moreover, Iraq owes Russia between $7 and $9 billion from the Soviet era, and Moscow intends to collect that money. 104 In addition, Iraq and Russia have been discussing a five-year economic cooperation program worth $40 billion. 105 Russia has ""trong economic interests in Iraq, especially in oil fields,"" said Mikhail Margelov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russia's Parliament and a key adviser to President Putin. 106 According to the International Agency's World Energy Outlook 2001, the total value of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's contracts with Russian companies could reach $1trillion. 107 Current economic interests and future economic opportunities are some of the reasons Russia has opposed U.S. military intervention in Iraq, especially since the United States has not guaranteed Russia's current economic interests in case of war against Iraq. Despite U.S. promises to consider Russia's economic interests and Moscow's ultimate refusal to enter an economic cooperation program with Iraq, Russia has been very resistant to Security Council Resolution 1441, and it still strongly opposes a U.S. war on Iraq without the approval of the Security Council. The potential for economic cooperation between Russia and Iraq, as well as Iraq's need to have Russia's strong support in the international arena, accounts for Russia's current interest in the status quo in Iraq. I do not think that it is possible for the United States ever to consider all of Russia's economic interests in Iraq. Furthermore, Russia opposes the growing expansion of American political and military influence in the region of Russia's vital interests, in general, and in Iraq particularly. Iraq, which holds the world's second largest oil reserves, is much more vital for Russia than Afghanistan or the former Soviet republics in Central Asia. However, even there Russia acted together with the United States to keep its influence in the region. Therefore, the United States is not likely to get Russia's vote in the Security Council for U.S. unilateral military actions in Iraq unless the United States guarantees the economic interests of Russia and acts in Iraq together with Russia. To wage a war on Iraq without the approval of the Security Council, as the United States did in 1992, may seem, in the short run, the easiest way for the United States to deal with the disarmament of Iraq. However, in the long run, the action will cost the United States more because it will discredit the United Nations and possibly aggravate relations with Russia. Help from both the United Nations and Russia will be necessary for the United States to continue the war against terrorism and promote international stability and other U.S. national interests. Russia is a traditional ally of North Korea, and the two countries' relations recently have intensified, in part because of President Kim Jong Il's two visits to Russia. The first visit in 2001 was a twenty-four-day, cross-country train trip from the southeastern border of the Russian Federation to St. Petersburg. During the second visit, North Korea's leader met with Putin in Vladivistok on 23 August 2002 and discussed linking railways and extending bilateral cooperation in energy, lumber, crude oil, metal industry, fishery, and various other economic sectors. 108 Putin and Kim reconfirmed implementation of the agreements they had already signed and discussed new agreements. As a result, a ""Memorandum on Cooperation"" was signed between the Committee for Promotion of International Trade of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Far East Investment Company of the Russian Federation. 109 Moreover, ""A Memorandum of Understanding on Rebuilding and Modernizing the Railways on the Eastern Coast of Korea"" was signed on 2 November 2002 in Pyongyang by the DPRK Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Railway Transport of the Russian Federation. 110 Before 11 September, North Korea and the Russian Federation strengthened their bilateral military cooperation by signing two military treaties during a visit to Russia of a high-ranking DPRK military delegation. On 27 April 2001, Kim Il Chol, vice chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission and minister of the People's Armed Forces, signed, with Russian vice premier Iliya Klebanov, an intergovernmental agreement in Moscow on cooperation in the field of military technology between the two countries. 111 The development of economic ties and the potential for military cooperation between Russia and an axis-of-evil country are not the only issues that irritate the United States. Another disagreement over North Korea is the denuclearization of this rogue state. Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov warned, ""This can only be achieved through constructive dialogue. Aggressive rhetoric and threats, and attempts to isolate North Korea can only escalate tensions, which will not help regional and international stability."" 112 China and Iran. Regardless of China's official position that proliferation of weapons of mass distraction is not in its interests and that the country opposes proliferation, the Bush administration has already sanctioned Chinese companies three times for transferring to Iran equipment and technology prohibited by the Iran Non-Proliferation Act of 2000. 113 For example, in January 2001 the State Department barred trade for two years with Liyang Chemical Equipment, China Machinery, and Electric Equipment Import and Export Company for violating the act by transferring equipment and technology to Iran that could be used to make chemical weapons. In another instance, nine firms from China and one from India sold technology to Iran between September 2000 and October 2001, according to Associated Press reports. As a result, eight of the entities have been sanctioned for a year under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 because the technology transfers contributed to Iran's chemical weapons program. 114 The penalties banned all departments and agencies of the U.S. government from purchasing goods, technology, or services from the sanctioned companies and individuals. Despite China's assertions that U.S. accusations are ""groundless"" and ""unjustified,"" this hot issue negatively affects U.S.-China relations. Also disturbing to the United States is China's involvement in an Iraqi military program. In February 2001, for example, China helped Iraq to build a fiber-optic communications system for a new air-defense network that had been targeted by U.S. and British bombing earlier. 115 Washington protested China's move as an apparent violation of UN sanctions on Iraq because the new air-defense network would greatly increase Iraq's ability to target and shoot down patrolling U.S. aircraft with anti-aircraft missiles. The German newspaper Taz also reported that the Chinese firm Huawei Technologies broke the embargo in 2000 and 2001 by supplying hi-tech fiberglass parts for air-defense installations. China's sales to North Korea of arms and materials for making chemical and nuclear weapons is another problem for U.S.-China relations. For instance, in December 2002, North Korea purchased twenty tons of tributyl phosphate, known as TBP, a key chemical used to extract material for nuclear bombs from spent nuclear fuel. Although the chemical also could be used in commercial processes, such as making plastics, ink, and paint, U.S. intelligence agencies believe that North Korea will use the TBP for its plutonium-based nuclear weapons program. 117 In February 2001, CIA director George Tenet stated in Senate testimony that China is a leading supplier of weapons and missiles to rogue states, such as Iran, Libya, and North Korea. 118 Even after the October meeting of President Jiang with President Bush in Crawford, Texas, when China's president said that China favored a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, the spread of nuclear raw materials to North Korea persists. White House national security adviser Condoleezza Rice told a visiting Chinese general recently that Beijing's help in stopping the North Korean nuclear program would be important to U.S.-China relations. 119 The United States is concerned with recently stepped-up contacts between Russia and the three axis-of-evil states as well as China's military help and materials sale to those countries. Russian and Chinese economic and military cooperation with Iran and Iraq is currently the biggest irritant to Washington, while North Korea is becoming another huge concern. 120 These conflicts are growing very quickly and are becoming the strongest constraints on U.S. foreign policy toward Russia and China. The relations between 11 September and current constraints on U.S., Russian, and Chinese foreign policies are depicted in tables 1 and 2. It is evident that not only have many present constraints been inherited from the period before 11 September, but also many new disagreements have been created since then. CONCLUSION Despite increasing cooperation, there are still many areas of disagreement between the United States and Russia, as well as the United States and China. They are serious points of conflict that restrain the further improvement of the relations and may even aggravate existing relations. Whether they were inherited from the past or appeared recently, all disagreements are dangerous because they make transitional U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations unstable. Therefore, it is reasonable to pay special attention to the potential threat from disagreements and not to overestimate the current levels of cooperation. To further advance cooperation and build more stable relations, the countries need to remove the constraints or reduce the negative effects from them. This may be done by resolving disagreements or by narrowing areas of disagreement through more respect to the national interests of other countries. So far, disagreements have done nothing but harm for international relations. They have discredited politicians and officials who promote closer cooperation between the countries. The most vivid example of this may be President Putin, whose political base for his new policy line, especially among the elite, remains very weak. Disagreements also decrease trust between governments and individual citizens. It is necessary to remember that Russia and China have been strong adversaries of the United States for decades and that a negative, suspicious attitude still exists at the grassroots level. Therefore, strong areas of conflict just widen the gap between those nations. Disagreements keep relations unstable and prevent positive development in new fields. One may say that only countries that have no dealings have no disagreements. However, I would argue that there are still too many strong conflicts in U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations for those countries to enjoy stable relationships and strategic partnerships. Notably, Russia and China tend to have common disagreements with the United States , which means that by aggravating them, the United States may weaken relations with both Russia and China. The most dangerous threats to U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations are the disagreements over rogue states and Taiwan. The United States desperately wants to keep Iran, Iraq, and North Korea away from WMD and nuclear technologies, while Russia and China try to promote their economic interests by selling those countries arms and building nuclear reactors there. In a similar manner, the United States sells weapons to Taiwan, which China opposes. Because Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are of such special interest, and because the United States, Russia, and China have such different views on dealing with the rogue states, any further action is likely to aggravate relations. U.S. war against Iraq, U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, Russia's help to build four more nuclear reactors in Iran, or China's sale of materials for making chemical and nuclear weapons to North Korea will likely have negative consequences, similar to those after Kosovo, for bilateral relations. The United States, Russia, and China need to consider the interests of other nations while promoting their own interests. Otherwise, selfish behavior may ruin recent achievements in bilateral cooperation. The crises over North Korea and Iraq are going to be real tests of U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations. If the countries manage to resolve these issues and further develop relations, it will be evidence that relations have changed substantially since the cold war. Implications and Policy Recommendations I present several implications and policy recommendations based on my research. First, the 11 September terrorist attacks shook U.S. national interests and, as a result, U.S. foreign policy toward Russia and China. The change from a threat-based model to a capability-based model in defense planning, and the need for cooperation with other powerful states to conduct war in Afghanistan and fight terrorism more successfully, have changed Russia and China from former adversaries and strategic competitors of the United States into current partners. Focusing on security issues and facilitating cooperation with these regional powers is a crucial shift in U.S. foreign policy. Second, although one should not overestimate the impact from 11 September, the terrorist attacks and the subsequent change in U.S. foreign policy were only two factors that affected international relations. Others include the signing of the U.S.-Russia Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty, U.S. unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the October hostage crisis in Moscow, and the U.S. nuclear posture review, all of which have shaped relations both positively and negatively. The terrorist attacks of 11 September have not resolved the old disagreements between the United States, China, and Russia. Nuclear confrontation, espionage, and trade disputes remain strong points of conflict. Furthermore, 11 September has not eliminated the appearance of new disagreements. For example, disagreements over Iraq and North Korea increased after the tragic event and remain strong. Third, U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations are defined by both cooperation and disagreement. A mixed picture is necessary to close the gap between the official view of relations, on the one hand, and the real state of relations, on the other. Although cooperation currently prevails in U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations, disagreements, which receive less public attention and are not viewed comprehensively, remain strong and have the potential to seriously damage relations. The creation of new disagreements or the aggravation of the old ones will weaken the foundation for U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China cooperation. Therefore, it is necessary to work not only on the resolution of present disagreements but also on the prevention of potential ones. By doing this, the United States could convert China into a close American ally, like the United Kingdom or Canada, although this would take many decades. More realistically, through continuous dialogue, mutual trade-offs and compromise, and mutual respect for the interests of other nations, the countries may eliminate some of the constraints on their relations, minimize disagreements to prevent them from hindering relations, and resist the appearance of new disagreements. This may not be easy or convenient in the short term, but it will pay off in the long term through mutually beneficial relations. Fourth, all three countries must treat areas of conflict very carefully to keep relations stable and cooperative. For example, Russia cannot build nuclear reactors in Iran, nor can China help Iraq with military equipment, and hope to retain good relations with the United States. At the same time, the United States cannot sell arms to Taiwan and be a reliable partner of China, and it cannot wage war on Iraq without the support of Russia and remain a trusted partner of the Russian Federation. Fifth, short-term, intensive cooperation in a few fields does not necessarily imply strong relations. Usually, the longer relations develop in one direction, the stronger they are. Unfortunately, new cooperation between the United States and Russia and China, which intensified rapidly after 11 September, is only about a year and a half old. Sixth, U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations are not currently stable and remain in transition. The period of transition provides these countries with both the opportunity for further improvement and the danger of the failure of a vulnerable relationship. Therefore, all three countries need to be vigilant to improve existing cooperation and extend cooperation into new areas and resolve or minimize conflict. Will gains in international relations outweigh losses? The foreign policy of each country allows national leaders to pursue security, economic, and other types of national interests. Sometimes, national interests may impel government leaders to promote a foreign policy that is likely to damage the state's relations with other nations. At that point, it is important to estimate the potential benefits and losses very carefully to ensure an overall positive outcome for relations. Russia, for example, must weigh the possible aggravation of relations if it continues nuclear cooperation with Iran; the United States must consider this, as well, if it continues arms sale to Taiwan or decides to wage a war on Iraq. It is a paradox that pursuing national interests may easily warm up or cool down relationships with other countries. For example, the terrorist attacks on the United States encouraged U.S. cooperation with regional powers. At the same time, the development of more sophisticated nuclear weapons and a defense shield for better protection of Americans may lead to an arms race and harm U.S. relations with Russia and China. What is certain is that it is in the national interest of each country to have positive relations with one another. In today's interdependent world, states are more likely to achieve their national interests through involvement, engagement, and cooperation than through isolationism, containment, or confrontation. Regardless of its superpower position in the world, the United States needs good relations with both Russia and China to gain their support in the Security Council, as well as their cooperation in fighting international terrorism. U.S. interaction with Russia is crucial for a number of reasons: 1. Russia's proximity to the world's most unstable regions, which are of interest to the United States 2. Russia's proximity to sources of terrorism 3. Russia's nuclear and technology arsenal, one of the biggest in the world 4. Russia's huge cache of chemical and biological weapons 5. Russia's impact on the Commonwealth of Independent States 6. Russia's influence on the present communist states 7. the possibility of the dissolution of Russia 8. the possibility that Russia will return to its totalitarian past. The United States also needs constant dialogue with China because of China's possibly hostile intentions toward Taiwan; China's arsenals of WMD, which it could sell to rogue states; and China's position as the third-largest exporter to the United States. At the same time, good relations with the United States are also in China's and Russia's national interests. Russia and China desperately need the U.S. market for selling their goods and raw materials, and they need the cooperation of the United States to reduce collectively their nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, Russia needs U.S. support for its entry to the WTO. If the relations between these countries suffer any damage, it will ruin international cooperation in the war against terrorism, increase instability, and launch a new arms race. Therefore, developing and maintaining good, stable relations with one another is in the best national interests of all three nations. This should provide a strong incentive to continue the transformation of bilateral relations and manage disagreements. The United States, Russia, and China are militarily and economically among the most powerful states; therefore, the relations between them heavily influence the international system. Because 11 September has changed U.S. foreign policy and started to change U.S. relations with Russia and China, it has also changed the character of the present international system. Although the international system remains unipolar and dominated by the United States, its character has been transformed from stable confrontation to unstable cooperation. As with transitional U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relations, cooperation has intensified greatly, but it has not totally replaced confrontation in the international system. As a result, strong confrontation and growing cooperation create huge instability in the international system. Although the cold war is over, today's world is becoming more unstable than it was just a decade ago. NOTES Research for this article was supported in part by the Edmund S.

760c1134-3755-4254-91ff-2b6600f84cf9,"Dj Vu All Over Again: Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn on the Soviet Western Frontier AMIR WEINER Abstract This article explores the complex dynamics that informed Soviet policies on the western frontier the territories stretching between the Baltic and Black Seas annexed by the Soviets in 193940 and involves several interlocking aspects: the permeability of borders prone to irredentist pressures by socialist satellites, mass tourism from the West and the Soviet bloc, and the increasing ow of information from foreign media sources; the conicting sentiments that led locals to embrace or reject reforms based on different pre-Soviet memories, the experiences of the Second World War, postwar sovietisation policies and the suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956; the impact of Romanian and Czechoslovak policies on the authorities and populations of the western republics and the Kremlins concerns over the region as key factors in the decision to invade Czechoslovakia; and, nally, the domestic and international consequences for an aging, self-styled revolutionary regime choosing between youthful reform and stagnant stability. The 1960s and 1970s in the Soviet Union were times of paradox. On the one hand, they bespoke accomplishment and condence. Following the tumultuous reign of Nikita Khrushchev, the political scene became more predictable, though not stagnant. Violent anti-Soviet guerrillas in the borderlands were long since crushed. Economic management was rationalised, and the economy continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in the 1950s. And in the international arena, the long quest for equal status with the other superpower, the United States, appeared nally to have been achieved Department of History, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, United States; edu.

The preoccupation of the Politburo with the minutest details among the volumes of information forwarded by the KGB on the emerging dissident movement, in particular from the non-Russian republics, showed that old habits die hard and that even the profound sense of accomplishment could not erase the half-century spent pursuing internal enemiesMoreover, the punitive organs had a vested institutional interest in magnifying internal threats if only to increase their clout and continue to extract resources. In fact, the absolute numbers of activists and incidents were nothing the KGB could not handleNevertheless, the agency admitted a certain unease. Relating the lessons of the 1960s to its young apprentices, the KGB directors sounded almost nostalgic for an earlier, simpler age when borders were controllable and the enemy recognisable and straightforward in its tactics and ideology. The decade saw the emergence of foreign broadcast stations as primary transmitters of hostile information into the Soviet Union and the employment of legal means to subvert Soviet order by non-Russian nationalist groups that used international crises and sophisticated propaganda to mobilise and expand their constituencies This article explores the complex dynamics that informed Soviet policies on the western frontier the territories stretching between the Baltic and Black Seas annexed by the Soviets in 193940 and involves several interlocking aspects: the permeability of borders prone to irredentist pressures by socialist satellites, mass tourism from the West and the Soviet bloc, and the increasing ow of information from foreign media sources; the conicting sentiments that led locals to embrace or reject reforms based on different pre-Soviet memories, the experiences of the Second World War, postwar sovietisation policies, and the suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956; the impact of Romanian and Czechoslovak policies on the authorities and populations of the western republics and the Kremlins concerns over the region as a key factor in the decision to invade Czechoslovakia; and nally, the domestic and international consequences for an aging, self-styled revolutionary regime choosing between youthful reform and stagnant stability. Indeed, the 1968 crisis raised several key questions for the polity, and as always, the western frontier offered the greatest series of challenges. What price were the Soviets willing to pay for the expansion of their economic, cultural and political horizons? Could the polity sustain pockets of autonomy in key border regions without risking the destabilisation of its interior? Why was a regime as powerful and realistic as 2 Joshua Rubenstein, Andrei Sakharov, the KGB, and the Legacy of Soviet Dissent, in Joshua Rubenstein and Alexander Gribanov, eds., The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov , 25; Ben Fowkes, The National Question in the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev: Policy and Response, in Bacon and Sandle, Brezhnev Reconsidered, 76. 3 Ibid., 767Viktor Chebrikov et al., eds., Istoriia Sovetskikh organov gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti , 5445.

Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 161 the Soviet regime unnerved by evidently impotent irredentist rhetoric? How real was the anxiety over a domino effect rolling in from the rebellious satellites? What were the sources of support for the regime in the border regions 21/2 decades after brutal annexation and pacication campaigns? Was the regime aware of the growing alienation of its youth from the ofcial ideology and, if so, what did it do about it? Did the 1968 crisis constitute a watershed in the Soviet domestic arena? In the late 1960s all these questions came to the fore. Nowhere were these questions and paradoxes more evident than on the western frontier. It was the old-new western frontier that the Soviet regime confronted in the second of what would become twelve-year-cycles of crisis across its rocky empire. The brutal suppression of the Hungarian uprising and the ensuing exiles and population exchanges in the borderlands in 19567 made it clear that the regime would not tolerate mass public deance, especially in the critically exposed western republics. At the same time, the polity witnessed the birth and institutionalisation of the dissident movement. Pressures for further cultural assimilation coincided with growing assertiveness in the struggle to maintain indigenous traditions, just as the memory of the great cataclysm of the Second World War continued to run along political, ideological and ethnic divides. The previous decade saw the frontier reclaiming its age-old status as a window to the West as millions of tourists crossed the borders to and from Western Europe, Scandinavia and the Eastern bloc, local populations tuned into broadcasts by foreign radio and television stations and adventurous youth created sub-cultures in the urban centres. The region was still scarred by the bloodletting of the not so distant war and sovietisation policies, but was also unsettled by its peacetime exposure to relative prosperity across the border. It was one of the prices of de-Stalinisation and, in a way, the inevitable result of the expanding economic and political horizons of the Soviet polity. It was also a constant test for a regime sworn to infallible ideology and monopoly over the articulation and dissemination of information. It was a place and populace that sought to reduce ethno-national tensions, yet remained vulnerable to irredentist claims by its socialist neighbours. It was a time and set of circumstances that turned the western frontier from a passive observer into an active participant in international politics. Above all was the shadow cast by the events of 1956, when the sight of a nearly toppled communist regime and the inow of alternative information provided sparks that inspired anti-Soviet activists to act on deep-seated ethno-national and political ideological resentments, offering hopes or rather illusions for realising their agendaFor Soviet leaders and citizens anxiously watching the unfolding drama during spring and summer 1968, it was dj vu all over again. From the Kremlin, Yuri Andropov, director of the KGB, politburo member, and ambassador to Hungary in 1956, observed that the methods and forms taken presently in Czechoslovakia 5 On the 1956 crisis on the Soviet western frontier, see Amir Weiner, The Empires Pay a Visit: Gulag Returnees, East European Rebellions, and Soviet Frontier Politics, The Journal of Modern History, 78, 2 . 162 Contemporary European History closely resemble the Hungarian ones. This external chaos has its own order. In Hungary, too, it started like this. Then came the rst echelon, then the second, and in the end, the Social Democrats. He urged his colleagues to nip in the bud attempts to set up nationalist organisations in non-Russian republics, especially those in the westAndropovs anxieties were probably not eased by the Czechoslovak press running articles on the fate of Imre Nagy, the doomed Hungarian leader in 1956, which triggered a sharp rebuke from BrezhnevAt roughly the same time the rising maverick writer and son of Evgenia Ginzburg, Vasilii Aksenov, pointedly chose to open his bitter tale of 1968 with echoes of November 1956, a time when marginal youngsters were drunk with the damp breeze from Europe that suddenly had started blowing in our direction, only to be crushed by Communist Youth Organisation vigilantes reminding the police that it was young snivellers like these who had caused all the trouble in HungarySearching for ways out of the debacle, the Soviets constantly looked for cues from the recent past. Window to the West While somewhat melodramatic and self-righteous, the KGBs assessment given above was not far off the mark. The second half of the 1960s indeed saw a steady infusion of outside information that pushed the political envelope on the western frontier. By then Estonia had regained its traditional role as Russias window to the West. Contemporary Russians referred to the republic as the Russian or Soviet abroad and intimated to Western correspondents that going there is really like going abroad. It was a place where Soviet citizens could enjoy subversive musical genres: from the rst Soviet production of West Side Story to the rst jazz festival featuring the legendary Charles Lloyd who received a fantastic eight minute and twenty-second ovation to religious compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach. Estonian speakers could read translations of Ionescos Rhinoceros and Kafkas Trial as early as 1966 and 1967 respectively, earlier than the rest of their fellow Soviet citizens. It was a Soviet republic where avant-garde art moved from private apartments to the galleries of the Union of Artists, something unthinkable in the Russian Republic. It was also the place where the First Secretary of the Communist Party reportedly said at an exhibition of experimental sculpture at the Academy of Sciences in 1967: I dont understand them at all. But no, you dont have to remove them. I am not an art specialist. The comparison with Nikita Khrushchevs vulgar outburst at the 6 Andropov in the course of a Politburo meeting on 15 March 1968, as cited in Rudolf Pikhoia, Sovetskii Soiuz: Istoriia vlasti, 19451991 , 309; Fowkes, The National Question, 76For Kdrs repeated reading of the situation in Czechoslovakia as analogous to 1956 Hungary, see his speeches at the meetings of leaders of the socialist bloc leaders in Dresden on 23 March and in Warsaw on 1415 July 1968 in Jaromr Navrtil, ed., The Prague Spring 1968 , 679, 218; Pikhoia, Sovetskii Soiuz, 324. 8 Vasilii Aksenov, Ozhog , 27, 32. The novel was written in 196975 but was published only in 1980 in the West. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 163 Manezh gallery exhibition, just ve years earlier, was unavoidable. And with Finland assuming an active role in the republics economy and culture, via steady streams of tourists and television broadcasts, Estonia became a rare enclave where both Soviet ofcials and ordinary citizens sought a break from the dreariness of everyday socialism It only made sense that Vasilii Aksenov chose Tallinn as the site of his enormously popular novels, Zvezdnyi billet and Pora, moi drug, pora . The novels broke new thematic and stylistic grounds in Soviet literature and celebrated Tallinn as a new mythical Siberia, minus the coercion. Oh, everybody goes to Siberia now, said Yuri. Yes, everybodys going east, explained Dimitrii. Thats why we go west! For the young Russians heading to Tallinn, it was a place where they could live on their own, break with the squares, and attend college only when they choose to do so, or just escape failed relationships. There, they could mimic Western popular culture , create their own dialect, exchange love notes in English, dance the Charleston and listen to calypso music in clubs, and listen to Bachs fugues in the Lutheran churches without being harassed by housing committees or Komsomol cells. When a seventeen-year-old protagonist scolded his twenty-eight-year-old, married brother that your career was decided for you before you were born, but Id rather be a tramp and suffer privation than spend my whole life like a little boy doing only what other people want me to do, it was more than an adolescent rebelliousness. In a society that by and large succeeded in channelling dissatisfaction to acceptable forms, even this quixotic and miniscule pretence of living beyond the Soviet pale and Aksenov did not endow his characters with more than that could not be shrugged off lightly, if only because these tales reached a large audience and presented Soviet readers with a real-life location where such dreams and illusions materialised. This free-going sub-culture was echoed in the political realm , with the Estonian authorities pursuing a distinctly lenient line towards former political troublemakers. On 18 May 1965 the republics authorities terminated the12 October 1957 decree that banned the return of convicted former anti-Soviet leaders and activists to the republics territory. For one thing, the meagre number in these categories a fraction of the 165 still in exile made their presence in the republic practically inconsequential, argued the ofcials. But it was their legalistic argument that stood out namely that the all-Union law should be applied without distinction. Current Soviet laws did not stipulate restrictions on residence for people 9 The above account draws on the excellent essay by V. Stanley Vardys, The Role of the Baltic Republics in Soviet Society, in Roman Szporluk, ed., The Inuence of East Europe and the Soviet West on the USSR , 14779,here, 159, 163, 165; and Romuald Misiunas and Rein Taagepera, The Baltic States: Years of Dependence, 19401990 , 15672. Although its political and cultural atmosphere was more cautious than Estonias, and despite having socialist Poland as its window to the West, Lithuania was attractive enough to bring some one million summer vacationers from the Russian Federation by 1968. Misiunas and Taagepera, The Baltic States, 172. 164 Contemporary European History who did time for especially dangerous state crimes and rendered the ban unnecessary, concluded the Estonian ofcials The loose political control in Estonia on the eve of the Czechoslovak crisis was particularly evident in the inux of Soviet Germans. On 7 May 1968, Johannes Kabin, the First Secretary of the Estonian Communist Party, received a note that several thousand ethnic Germans had settled in the republic over the past two years. The republics security ofcials, seemingly unaware of this population movement, informed the party that while only eleven ethnic Germans had settled in 1966, two hundred more had arrived in 1967,and by May 1968 the number had reached more than 1,200 and rising. Alas, this migration was instigated by local party and state organs that had recruited Germans who had been deported to the Central Asian republics during and after the war. According to the Tajik KGB ofcials, Estonian agitators who recruited ethnic Germans to work on new state farms also hoped to drive Russians out of the republic. This was all the more astounding in the light of the nal cleansing of the republic of the several hundred remaining Germans at the end of the war. Many of the recruited Germans were initially deported from Ukraine and Moldavia, including convicted wartime collaborators, and had relatives in Germany with whom they kept up correspondence, expressing their wish to emigrate, as well as their satisfaction at living in Estonia since it is closer to the Motherland. The KGB viewed this group as a security risk and recommended an end to their recruitmentWhether these Germans were indeed targeted by foreign intelligence services cannot be conrmed. More relevant for the unfolding crisis in Czechoslovakia was that the EstonianGerman episode revealed a region where political alliances were formed on the bases of religious and ethnic afnities, as well as the relatively favourable treatment by the Germans during the war and a strong sense of victimisation at the hands of the Stalinist regime. Remarkably, Estonian Communists did not try to conceal the vulnerability of their republic, and the Baltic region in general, where the inuence of Western propaganda is more noticeable than in other places, as one of them conded in late June 1968 Socialist irredentism Still, Estonia paled in comparison with western Ukraine and Moldavia, where the integrity of postwar borders was coming under direct challenge from deviant socialist satellites. With the sovietisation of their neighbours, the justication for annexations as liberation from imperialist oppression became obsolete. Having claimed that borders cannot breed conict among socialist countries, Khrushchev went on to 10 Eesti Riigiarhiivi Filiaali arhiivifond 172, arhiivinimistu 1, sailitushik 306, leht 4245, 4849 . Not surprisingly, the ethnic Germans continued to arrive there were 10,281 of them in Estonia by 1974 and to demand publicly the right to emigrate to Germany.

Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 165 prophesy in early March 1959 that with the worldwide victory of communism, state, and even ethnographical boundaries would become irrelevant, nothing more than the historically evolved fact that this or that nationality inhabits a given territoryBarely three years after the Hungarian uprising, the ethno-national shockwaves it sent throughout the region had become lost in the vision, or rather delusion of communism around the corner. Always inhospitable to utopian claims and interpretations, the international arena offered an immediate challenge. Unwittingly, the Soviet leader opened the door for commonsensical inquiries about the reasons for preventing the unication of ethnic minorities such as the Yugoslav Macedonians and the Soviet Moldavians with their ethnic brethren in socialist Bulgaria and Romania respectively. In an ironic twist, the successful spread of the socialist system across the border deprived the Soviets of the viable tool of ideology and the role of dynamic external homeland while bringing back entrenched historical claims. The problem was particularly thorny in Bessarabia and the northern Bukovina where ethnic Romanian and Ukrainian components were joined with the Soviet republics of Moldavia and Ukraine in 1940. The territories, with nearly two-thirds of their inhabitants ethnic Romanians at the time, had been under Habsburg rule since 1774 and the Russian empire since 1812 . From 1918 until the end of the Second World War with a brief spell of Soviet rule in 194041 they fell under Romanian rule. As tensions between Romania and the Soviet Union intensied, the disputed territories resurfaced with a vengeance and apparently to the great surprise of the Soviets. The SovietRomanian split involved a whole range of issues, from assertion of autonomy within the Soviet bloc, the withdrawal of Soviet troops, trade relations, allegiances in the Sino-Soviet rift, and Romanias independent diplomatic course with the West. Interestingly enough, Khrushchev, who claimed to have a high opinion of the Romanian leadership, speculated that the core of the Romanian dissatisfaction was their misunderstanding of the Soviet historical claims to Bessarabia. In intimate circles the thin-skinned Khrushchev gave full vent to his concerns: The Mamalyzhniki are not a nation, but a whore ... pernicious nationalistic and anti-Soviet attitudes are developing in Romania, even in the ranks of its Communist Party, must be cut off at the root Earlier in the decade, the Soviet leader claimed to have reminded the Romanians that even if you dont like us, the fact remains that history has made us neighbours ... now that Romania is a socialist country, there is no reason for us not to have fraternal relationsAnd yet, the not-so-tactful warning went unheeded. In line with his standard modus operandi, Khrushchev sought to intimidate the Romanians by using the highly sensitive issue of the territorial integrity of their country. By late 1963, 13 Cited in Robert Kings insightful discussion, Minorities under Communism: Nationalities as a Source of Tension among Balkan Communist States , 99101. 14 Arkadii Shevchenko, Razryv s Moskvoi , 126. Mamalyga is a traditional Romanian porridge. 15 Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament, ed. Edward Crankshaw and Jerrold Schechter, trans. 166 Contemporary European History Soviet leaders and academics started referring to Transylvania as an unresolved issue. A prominent Romanian visitor to the Soviet Union was alarmed by the prevalent notion that Transylvania is a region lying only temporarily under Romanian control, a region that Romania does not really own, and that such arguments relied on Hungarian sources and were advanced by Hungarian scholars in the Soviet Union. Simultaneously the Soviet tourist agency distributed a pamphlet, Visiting the Soviet Union, to foreign tourist agencies, highlighting a holiday route along the Danube from Vienna to Ukraine that included a map on which portions of Romania parts of Maramures and Transylvania appeared as part of the Soviet Union Infuriated, the Romanians turned the tables on Khrushchev and invoked their own grievances over the 1940 annexations. That year the Romanian leadership authorised the publication of obscure comments by Karl Marx and an equally forgettable letter by Friedrich Engels that denied the legitimacy of the Ottoman transfer of Bessarabia to the Russian Empire. The existence of Marxs notes in Amsterdam, which he wrote in the margins of a book by the French historian Elias Regnault, had been related to the Romanians by a Polish scholar as early as 1957. But aware of the explosiveness of the revelation and afraid of an anti-Soviet provocation by another socialist country with its own axe to grind, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Romanian leader, initially ordered a scholarly verication regarding the authenticity of the text, and then authorised a limited edition for internal party use. But with the rift becoming public following the so-called declaration of independence adopted by the Central Committee of the Romanian party in April 1964, Dej ordered the printing of a larger number of copies of Marxsnsemnari despre romni . Now all hell broke lose. Adding fuel to the re was the change of guard in the Kremlin, with Leonid Brezhnev, the one-time leader of Soviet Moldavia, now at the helmAt the same time the Romanians began operating a powerful radio transmitter in Iasi, the capital of historical Moldavia located a few miles from Soviet Moldavia, broadcasting primarily programmes about Romanian culture, history and literature, and reminding Soviet Romanians that they were not forgotten. A publication appeared featuring the blunt statement: Finland is Finnish, Poland is Polish, Bessarabia is Romanian. There is no question of bringing together various populations dispersed and related who could be called Russian. This is a brutal and undisguised conquest of foreign territories; this is theft pure and simple 16 Charles King, Sidelights on SovietRomanian Relations in the 1960s, paper presented at the Second International Congress of Romanian Studies, Iasi, Romania, 610 July 1993. I thank Professor King for providing me with the unpublished paper. See also his invaluable analysis of the Moldavian dilemma from its Soviet incarnation to the present: Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture . 17 This account is based on a series of interviews with Paul Niculescu-Mizil, then head of the Propaganda Department of the Romanian Central Committee, in his O istorie traita (Bucharest: Enciclopedica, 1997), 513, 1357Nicholas Dima, From Moldavia to Moldova: The SovietRomanian Territorial Dispute, East European Monographs 309 , 48, 50; King, Minorities under Communism, 2267. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 167 By mid-decade the dispute was already spilling over into the international arena, especially with the incitement of the Chinese, who were eager to add another weapon to their arsenal in the bitter rift with the Soviets. Already, in January 1957, Zhou En-lai, the Chinese premier, claimed to have urged Khrushchev to make proper arrangements for the territorial issues covering Japan, China, the Middle East and the Eastern European countries including Finland. Although he did not receive a satisfactory answer, the issue was not addressed in public at the timeA few years later all inhibitions disappeared. When a high-level Romanian delegation travelled to the Crimea to debrief Khrushchev on a meeting with the Chinese in March 1964, the Soviets were unnerved by the fact that the Romanians did not express any disagreement with what the Chinese had said about Bessarabia. This conversation left a nasty taste in our mouths. We began to suspect that maybe the Romanians still held a grudge against us for returning Bessarabia to the Soviet Union after the war He was right. Ion Maurer, the Romanian premier and head of the Romanian delegation not only conrmed Khrushchevs account, adding that both of us knew who was right, but for us it did not matter much since we were in their handsThe Chinese did not let up and in the course of a meeting with a delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party on 10 July that year, Chairman Mao pointedly stated that it was time to put an end to the allotment of foreign territories by a country with a population of only 220 million a territory of 22 million square kilometres. There are too many places occupied by the Soviet Union, said Mao, offering a laundry list of Soviet annexations that started with Mongolia and the Kuriles followed ominously by Romania, East Germany, Poland and Finland If the volume and tenor of the Soviet reactions were the measures, then Mao clearly touched a raw nerve. Simultaneously displaying insecurity and resolve, common-sensical realpolitik and reexive emotions, the Soviets challenged Maos assertion regarding the redrawing of borders. Even if this could be done peacefully, where should people born on these territories be moved to? How would they be compensated for their lifes work? If people refused to move voluntarily along with the territory, would they be moved by force? What nation would allow its land to be dismembered? And who was going to be the supreme judge deciding which nation had land in abundance or a shortage, from what country land was to be taken away, and what country was to be added to, and how much was to be taken away and how much added?23 One could easily mock the self-righteousness of the Soviet objections. After all, the Soviets deftly practised all of the above in carving their western borderlands. 19 Denis Doolin, Territorial Claims in the Sino-Soviet Conict: Documents & Analysis, Hoover Institution Studies 7 , 456. 20 Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament, 232 Maurer also dispelled the common view that the Romanians went to Beijing to mediate between the two communist giants. Rather, Maurer went there to convince the sceptical Chinese that Romania was trying to steer an independent course away from Soviet hegemony: Lavinia Betea, Maurer si lumea de ieri. Marturii despre stalinizarea Romaniei , 1767Doolin, Territorial Claims, 43Doolin, Territorial Claims, 678. 168 Contemporary European History Now, however, they found themselves in an unfamiliar position of having to defend what they considered as indisputable gains. Second, the emotional reaction to any alteration of the borders drew on the experience and legacy of the Great Patriotic War, an event already established as a foundational myth for the polity. In the course of meetings with German journalists, Aleksei Adzhubei, Khrushchevs son-in-law and the editor of Izvestiia, repeatedly referred to the borders as sacred, inviolable, guarded not only by our entire military power but also the hearts of all our people, and concluded, there are border problems which cannot be the subject of political talks or of a political deal. This refers primarily to the frontiers that took shape in Europe after World War II. But then, this also refers to our frontiers as a whole. There can be no appeal to sentimentality on this matter. Here justice triumphs, which is expressed for us in the single word which will be remembered all our lives victory The Romanian leaders displayed many characteristics. Naivet, however, was not one of them. Gheorghiu-Dej, Maurer and Ceausescu were seasoned revolutionaries and politicians who knew the ins and outs of Soviet politics. Did they actually believe that the Soviets would relinquish territory to which they had credible historical claims? Or was it just one more tool in a prolonged struggle to establish their independence, raising one issue in order to squeeze concessions elsewhere? Or was it meant for domestic consumption, with the aim of mobilising their population under a nationalist ag? In public, Romanian ofcials did not shed much light on their motives and expectations, even during the rare occasions when they discussed them with their Soviet counterparts. Discussing the issue in late 1967 with a Soviet counterpart, Romulus Neagu, a Romanian representative at the United Nations, admitted that the Romanian leadership understood that a distinct Moldavian nation was being created in Soviet Moldavia, independently of the Romanian people. This was a marked change from 194854 when the Moldavian peasants Neagu had met then expressed their wish to live in Romania. Now, however, a young generation was coming of age and attaching its fate to the Soviet UnionNeagu may not have been aware that barely ve years earlier Gheorghiu-Dej had stunned the Moldavian leader by stating bluntly that the Romanian and Moldavian languages are one and the same, just as Romanians and Moldavian are one and the same people. In the company of his advisors Dej was even more assertive: If, at the end of the war, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the Herta County had been reincorporated into the Romanian national unitary state, the Romanian people would have greatly appreciated Stalin and the Soviet people. As long as the current situation lasts there is serious friction between us and the Soviets. The problem must be solved in accordance with the rights and interests of the Romanian people Whatever reasons drove the Romanians to revive irredentist claims, they did not let 24 Doolin, Territorial Claims, 467Tsentralnyi derzhavnyi arkhiv hromadskykh obiednan Ukrany 1/25/22/12Niculescu-Mizil, O istorie traita, 175; Paul Sfetcu, 13 ani n anticamera lui Dej., ed. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 169 up. Behind the faade of an academic, historical debate, and without much hope of regaining the lost territories, they continued to pursue the issue in public, repeatedly unsettling the Soviets. Few were more agitated than Petro Shelest, the hard-line Ukrainian boss. From early on Shelest hammered home at any opportunity the tight linkage between the events across the border, the loss of monopoly and control over information, irredentist sentiments and the fragile state of the western regions. A poster child of the Stalinist system, Shelest embodied its contradictions. He owed his rise to the terror of the 1930s, yet was bitter about its human and psychological costs. He took special pride in chairing one of the rehabilitation commissions of Gulag prisoners in 1956, but was spiteful about the violence meted out against communists in Hungary and the Soviet leaders need for protection while visiting the socialist satelliteLike the rest of the non-Russian communist leaders, even more so after the 1956 crisis, Shelests own career and identity were rooted in a dogged determination to pre-empt irredentist claims and separatist, nationalist revival in his own jurisdiction. Memories of the civil war of the late 1940s and the upheaval caused by the Gulag returnees during the Hungarian uprising were all too vivid. In late April 1965 Shelest warned Moscow about the impact of Romanian irredentist claims on the frontier. The region was abuzz with rumours about the impending return of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to Romania. Romanian tourists informed locals of the specic date of the transfer, and villagers who claimed to follow foreign radio broadcasts told fellow peasants about an ultimatum issued by the Western powers and China to the Soviet Union to recognise the 1939 borders, or else they would be forced to do so. The rumour campaign was accompanied by growing hostility to Soviet citizens in Romania, and the mailing of anti-Soviet literature that referred to the annexed regions as Romanian At this point, the Moldavian Communist Party organisation was brought in. On the occasion of the twenty-fth anniversary of the annexation to the Soviet Union, the Moldavian ofcial organ issued a sharp reminder of the Romanian partys persistent support for unication throughout the interwar yearsShortly thereafter Brezhnev demanded and secured Ceausescus formal reiteration of Romanias acceptance of the postwar borders. But with the apparent lack of goodwill on both sides, the Moldavian attacks on Romanian claims soon resumed. In his speech to the congress, Bodiul condemned bourgeois apologists are striving to discredit and denigrate the conquests of the Soviet Union, sow hostility between the socialist countries, fan nationalism and chauvinism, make territorial claims against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and demand revision of the results of the Second World War. The strong words, however, were accompanied by the open admission of the impact of Romanian propaganda that gave rise to unhealthy inuences in the 27 Petro Shelest, Spravzhnii sud istorii shche poperedu, ed. Yuri Shapoval , 701, 11113, 11819. 29 Dokumenty internatsionalnoi proletarskoi solidarnosti, Komunist Moldavii, 6 , 339. 170 Contemporary European HistoryrepublicRetaliating on 7 May 1966, on the occasion of the forty-fth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian Communist Party, Ceausescu raised the stakes by denouncing resolutions of both the interwar Romanian Communist Party and the Comintern that endorsed the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. In a sharply worded speech, Ceausescu condemned the severance of territories that were overwhelmingly inhabited by Romanians from the Romanian unitary state The avalanche of counterclaims emanating from the Moldavian Republic indicated that the Soviets were shaken. By then, history writing had already become a key arena in the growing rift. Party regional committees on the frontier reported on mass-circulation monographs, such as History of Stephen the Great by the late nationalist historian Nicolae Iorga that was also circulated in Ukraine, and referred to the disputed territories as Romanian lands, and the 1966 revised edition of a school textbook on the history of Romania that stated that the territories were transferred under Soviet ultimatumIn early September that year, Shelest ordered the Institute of History of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences to get involved in the all-Union project ordained by Moscow, entitled On the Further Working Out and Clarication of Problems in the History of SovietRomanian Relations, and the Ukrainian Politburo devised a plan to intensify propaganda work in the regions bordering on Romania, including the improvement of radio and television broadcasts in the Romanian and Moldavian languages The village of Krasnoilsk in the Chernivtsi region embodied Shelests nightmares of the uncontrolled spread of separatistnationalist sentiments among a receptive Romanian population. The 5,083 ethnic Romanians who formed an absolute majority of the 6,457 villagers were susceptible to the propaganda owing from across the border. Shelest forwarded Moscow a leaet by an alleged secret organisation Free Bukovina, that referred to the Bukovina as a Russian colony, complained about the Russian discrimination against the Romanian population, demanded that the Russian capitalist-colonizers depart for home before they were kicked out by the workers, boasted that the long awaited liberation was approaching, since Ceausescu promised to liberate the Bukovina, and would keep his sacred word, and concluded with rousing battle-cries, Long Live free Bukovina! Long Live Romania! Long Live Ceausescu the Liberator! From His Grave, Antonescu, the Most Beloved of Men, is Rising to the Bloody Battle!34 Throughout 1967, Romanian tourists and ofcials continued to agitate their Soviet counterparts with talk about the coming return of the Bukovina , referring to the territories as their 30 King, Minorities under Communism, 232King, Minorities under Communism, 2335; Stephen Fischer-Galati, The Moldavian Soviet Republic in Soviet Domestic and Foreign Policy, in Szporluk, The Inuence of East Europe, 2456; Dima, From Moldavia to Moldova, 51TsDAHOU 1/25/24/13; 22/27.

But for these actions the Soviet Union is not considered as an occupier. So why Israel is now condemned as aggressor when it liberated ancient Jewish lands?35 On 25 April 1968 an angry Shelest presented to the Ukrainian Party Moscows position on international issues. Amid brutal attacks on Israeli and World Zionist aggression in the Middle East and on the Czechoslovak leadership, the Ukrainian Party boss lashed out at the Romanians special position in international affairs, especially their deviation from the principles of Marxism-Leninism and their inaming of nationalist passions with the aim of forming Greater Romania. As a direct neighbour of Romania, Ukraine was especially sensitive to those who were alien to the spirit of proletarian internationalism and socialist solidarity, stated Shelest, and he concluded with an ominous warning that the CPSU and its sister parties would not allow Romania to paralyse the Warsaw Pact Ultimately Romania was not invaded, for a variety of reasons, not least of which was its leaders adherence to the strictures of single-party dictatorship and non-market economy that neutralised the challenge to the Soviet domestic order. This would not be the case with Czechoslovakia, the other socialist satellite that fomented anxieties over Ukrainian territorial integrity, this time in the perennially contested Transcarpathian region. Indeed, one of Dubeks vivid memories from his dealing with the Soviet leadership prior to the invasion was Shelest accusing him of harbouring plans to reincorporate the Transcarpathian region into Czechoslovakia Since Subcarpathian Ruthenia had been part of the interwar Czechoslovak Republic, many on the Soviet side of the border viewed such an event as likely. To the dismay of the Ukrainian authorities, Czechoslovak party leaders themselves were ambivalent when asked by their constituencies in the course of mass public meetings whether the region that was taken illegally from Czechoslovakia would be returnedTheir uneasiness was increased by the appeal of the Action Committee for a democratic and socialist Czechoslovakia, whose borders were established fty years ago that had been posted throughout Czechoslovakia that summer. Denying that the region had ever belonged to Russia or that the people there were considered Ukrainians until the postwar annexation, the authors provided a detailed account of the Czechoslovak struggle to regain the region after its occupation in 1939 by Hungary and the eventual forced annexation by the Soviet Union. They concluded with a ringing call: Now, 35 TsDAHOU 1/24/6387/91; 6386/192TsDAHOU 1/25/97/305Navrtil, The Prague Spring 1968, 305Here according to Jan Koscelansk, the rst secretary of the East Slovakia regional party committee in a conversation with the secretary of the Transcarpathian region on 29 April 1968.

Identied with the struggle for national liberation in both world wars, and persecuted during the 1950s, the former general who fought on the Soviet side during the war was viewed by some as the future unier of the Czechoslovak lands. President Svoboda demanded that the Soviet Union return Transcarpathia to Czechoslovakia. Svoboda will carry out his plans and not yield on them because he fought with the Transcarpathians against fascist Germany, related a stoker at the Khust ceramic factory. Others accepted at face value the Czechoslovak right to the region or wished for a border change that would entail the restoration of the interwar social and economic system Socialist borders, non-socialist information The situation in the western Ukrainian provinces was further complicated by the Ukrainian diaspora community across the border in the Presov region of Eastern Slovakia. Fifty- to sixty-thousand strong, the Presov Ukrainians were concentrated in the mountainous regions and, most importantly, were the least collectivised nationality in Czechoslovakia. Following a ruthless campaign against bourgeois nationalism and the dominant Greek Catholic Church, and growing tensions with the Slovak population and authorities, many in the community that had traditionally identied itself as Ruthenian and Russian-oriented came to adopt a more pronounced Ukrainian prole. Running its own Ukrainian-language newspapers and radio broadcasts that enjoyed a large readership in the western provinces, the Presov press established itself as a primary source of information for Ukrainians on both sides of the border, and in other socialist countries as well. Starting in 1967, the leading Presov newspapers breached Soviet taboos with growing vigour. Their issues included an interview with Ivan Dziuba, the literary critic and author of Internationalism or Russication?, who placed himself in the mainstream of critical Europeans, and a letter by a Kievan Ukrainian who pointed to Czechoslovak Ukrainians as the best representative of the Ukrainian national idea and mourned the loss of hundreds of Ukrainian writers executed or imprisoned in concentration camps as well as 10 million others who died in the famine of 19323 as a result of collectivisation. They also reprinted letters from Soviet Ukrainians that expressed gratitude to Czechoslovak Ukrainians, who taught them how to defend our spiritual and cultural treasures, and condemned Stalins repression of Ukrainian culture. Finally, and most controversially, 39 Kramer, Ukraine and the SovietCzechoslovak Crisis of 1968 , 31214. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 173 strong protests against the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia were published in Nove Zhyttia and Duklia immediately after the invasion The Prague Spring had an immediate impact on dissidents on the frontier. In a letter to Shelest from his Kiev prison cell dated 15 May 1968, Valentyn Moroz, a former history teacher from Ivano-Frankivsk, advocated a renewal of the Leninist policy of Ukrainianisation implied in the Czechoslovak case, which, he wrote, guaranteed the future and is in the interest of Ukrainian communists. For the imprisoned Viacheslav Chornovil, historical experience showed that two paths have become discernible in socialism: that along which Yugoslavia, and now Czechoslovakia, are making their way, and that of Stalin and Mao Zedong. Centralism is a very shaky and uncertain position, which must inevitably lead towards one of these paths, throwing the masses off their bearings by undermining their faith in any ideals, except that of more or less secure and peaceful vegetation One could not ignore the radicalising impact of the unfolding drama across the border on the thoughts and expectations of dissidents, their small numbers notwithstanding. That was certainly true for the cagey Soviet leadership. At this point Leonid Brezhnev addressed the Czechoslovak Party leadership on the issue of destabilising rhetoric: Comrades, you know about the CPSUs principled position based on full respect for the independence of all fraternal parties and countries. But not every question is a purely internal matter ... After all, your newspapers are also read by Soviet citizens and your radio broadcasts attract listeners in our country as well, which means that all this propaganda affects us just as much as it does you His warning went unheeded. The removal of travel restrictions additionally complicated a volatile situation. In their summary report on tourism for 1967, Estonian authorities ordered that guides be trained to decisively unmask attempts to spread bourgeois and dissenting ideology. Growing streams of tourists from neighbouring Finland bombarded Soviet guides with questions on the number of Russians in Estonia, their share in the government, their impact on life in the republic, the language of instruction in schools and the satisfaction of Estonians with Soviet power. They also pointed out the small number of shops, the long queues and the absence of freedom to travel out of the Soviet Union. Most troubling were questions about independent Estonia, and whether the Soviet Estonians wanted to restore the old order. One visitor attempted to comfort a nervous guide, saying, We Finns are your brothers and have always worried about 41 See Grey Hodnett and Peter Potichnyj, The Ukraine and the Czechoslovak Crisis, Occasional Paper 6 , 54, 59, 62, 72, 74. 42 Yaroslav Bihun, ed., Boomerang: The Works of Valentyn Moroz , 1467; Viacheslav Chornovil, Letter from the Camp, 3 May 1968, in Michael Brown, ed., Ferment in the Ukraine: Documents by V.

But it was not only foreign tourists arriving with unsettling questions and observations that concerned Soviet Communists. Estonians visiting Finland were exposed even more directly to subversive views. Thus, on the night of 22 August 1968, a group of 380 Estonians on a boat trip were greeted at the Helsinki port by a crowd of fty or sixty youngsters shouting Down with Soviet imperialism! and Viva Dubek!45 In Western Ukraine, Yuri Ilnytskyi, the rst secretary of the Transcarpathian regional party committee who was in constant contact with his east Slovakian counterparts across the border, repeatedly expressed uneasiness with the Ukrainian newspaper Nove Zhyttia that was published in Czechoslovak Presov and featured unacceptable nationalist opinionsOn Shelests instructions, on 12 May 1968 Ilnytskyi forwarded to the Central Committee in Moscow a report on Czechoslovak television broadcasts and the Czechoslovak press. With the recent end to the jamming of foreign radio broadcasts and the removal of genuine inspections at the border checkpoints, Czechoslovakia had willingly turned itself into a transmission point for spies, anti-socialist and anti-Soviet literature, and all kind of religious objects. More than fty thousand tourists from West Germany and Austria were entering Czechoslovakia every day: To cross the border, all a tourist has to do is to stick his head out of the buss window and show a paper to the border guard, who then smiles happily at him and wishes him a good time in Prague ... Other reports showed border guards removing barbed wire from the border installations, reported Ilnytskyi. Television broadcasts of May Day festivities featured demonstrators demanding an end to communist dictatorship as well as the formation of a new polity modelled on Western multi-party systems. More troubling were reports pertaining to religious and socioeconomic affairs. The Czechoslovak media reported extensively on the revival of the Greek Catholic Church in Eastern Slovakia, a true red ag for the Soviets. The Church had been the spiritual core of the Ukrainian nationalist movement in Galicia and Transcarpathia, and was suppressed in postwar Czechoslovakia as well as the Soviet Ukraine. And in its treatise on SovietCzechoslovak relations, the printed media directly challenged the socialist socioeconomic order. A recent article in Rud Prvo, wrote Ilnytskyi, claimed that the years of the cult of personality included the imposition of outdated and ill-suited Soviet experience, such as the egregiously unscientic Lysenko school. This not-so-tacit reference to the collective farm system was explosive in western Ukraine, where it was seen to represent the ills of Soviet power. The articles celebration of the close ties forged between Czechoslovak and Soviet students who themselves today are seeking new paths to follow, do not like 44 ERAF 1/302/72/9, 202ERAF 1/302/71/142; 1/301/151/27TsDAHOU 1/25/27/2324. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 175 the phrases muttered by agitators, and are more critical than the previous generation was, could not but further unnerve the already agitated Soviet regimeThanks to the Czechoslovak media, western Ukrainians, the most rebellious of the Soviet nationalities, could now watch and read and draw their own conclusions on issues that were still strictly taboo in their country. Alarmed by the unsavoury phenomena of the continuous ow of negative information into his domain, Shelest ordered the KGB command in charge of the Western Border District in late May to submit a report on border controls, the transport of politically harmful literature, travel and tourism, and the inspection of freight trains. The agency admitted that the border was practically beyond control. Based on agreements with their Hungarian, Polish, Czechoslovak and Romanian counterparts, each border guard was expected to inspect only outgoing trains. The one-sided inspection resulted in the arrival of thousands of trains that were not inspected by Soviet border guards, barely touched by the short-handed Polish and Hungarian guards and untouched by the Czechoslovaks. There was not much hope with the Romanians given the recent political fallout between the two governments, lamented the KGB ofcials. The 45,403 ideologically harmful items seized in 1967 and the rst quarter of 1968 were admittedly a drop in the ocean, given the sheer numbers of incoming foreigners that year some 828,576 people, including 92,585 from capitalist countries. Shelest therefore requested Moscow to review current procedures as well as an additional 1,500 personnel to staff the checkpoints and two hundred KGB operational agents in ve of the west Ukrainian regions Following a visit to the western regions, Shelest entered in his diary on 14 June that he informed Brezhnev of locals receiving information through direct contacts with inhabitants of regions along the border. Ten days later, Shelest recorded the sense of urgency felt by regional Party bosses, who demanded extremely urgent measures to correct the poor situation with communication and media: In these regions the radio and television practically dont work at all. At the same time, the residents are listening to Western radio stations and watching Western television Frustrated by the continuous inow of information, during a meeting atierna nad Tisou in late July Shelest accused the Czechoslovak leaders of approving the publication of counter-revolutionary tracts that were later sent to Ukraine through specic channels. The alarming developments in Czechoslovakia are a matter of common concern to the Soviet Union, averred Shelest. 47 TsDAHOU 1/25/29/712Kramer, Ukraine and the SovietCzechoslovak Crisis of 1968 , 297300.On 28 May, a week after Shelests tirade, Radianska Ukrana reported the apprehension of two Americans who allegedly tried to smuggle thousands of anti-Soviet and religious leaets into Ukraine.

We have a population of 46 million, including many nationalities, of whom nearly 2million are Communists. We and you, our Czech friends, are direct neighbours, and, as is customary with neighbours, we know a lot about each other that is not known or even noticed by those further away ... We see and hear your radio and television broadcasts, and read your newspapers. Hence, for us in Ukraine what is going on in Czechoslovakia, a state supposedly friendly to us, is all the more insulting Catapulted to the forefront of the national scene throughout the duration of the crisis, Yuri Ilnytskyi, a once-obscure secretary of the Transcarpathian regional party committee, offered lessons to fellow Soviets in his own region but also indirectly to socialist neighbours across the border. After admitting the attractions of foreign radio and television broadcast for ethnic minorities, Ilnytskyi called for constant vigilance, especially at a time when Transcarpathia once an isolated corner of Europe has become a lively international crossroads and one of the main tourist highways in the country. In his view, not all the tourists arrived with good intentions, as evidenced by conscated anti-Soviet literature. In such trying times, concluded Ilnytskyi, the Party and the workers should sharpen their ability to distinguish between friend and foe A bastion of hope? As was to be expected, the docile and thoroughly sovietised western Belorussian Communists and non-party members featured as the most anti-Czechoslovak along the western frontier. True, the authorities recorded dissenting views, especially in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. Leaets, such as Their Freedom Today is Our Freedom Tomorrow, and Lies the Weapon of the Neo-Stalinists, were spotted in Minsk, along with individuals who condemned the invasion as a violation of the democracy and sovereignty of the Czechoslovak people. Food shortages in the sensitive western regions of Brest and Hrodna did not help either Overall, however, the republics leadership was able to parade an impressive number of supporting voices that were notable for their militancy. The chairman of a collective farm in the Brest region, who declared in a meeting on 20 July that if necessary, I will step forward with arms in hands to defend the achievements of socialism, was cited as an example of clarity. With the invasion under way, military personnel weighed in with even more militant views. Interestingly, it was deant Romania that inspired the aggressive mood. We must destroy the counter-revolution ... This will also be a great lesson for Romania, and We should have done it in Romania, too. Send in the army, impose order and get rid of Ceausescu. How could he lead such a policy, if he were a real communist? I cannot refer to him as anything but a political prostitute, were two among many similar voices 50 Kramer, Ukraine and the SovietCzechoslovak Crisis of 1968, 235Yuri Ilnytskyi, Nashe znamia internatsionalizm, Komunist Ukrainy 1 , 856, 93Natsyianalny arkhiu Respubliki Beloruss 4/62/709/142, 152NARB 4/62/709/89, 136, 139, 156. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 177 Equally helpful for the regime was the unsettling, living memory of the bloody 1956 uprising in Hungary. Veterans of the intervention offered their services in Czechoslovakia, if needed, or recalled that a similar situation in Hungary was normalised only when a more decisive and strong-willed leader took the reins and fought off the counter-revolution. Six months after the invasion, die-hards still advocated tough measures against the counter-revolutionary elements in Czechoslovakia And yet, despite such reassuring signs, the frenzied activities of the Belorussian Party betrayed unmistakable anxiety. Summer and autumn 1968 were lled with mass meetings that sought to convey to party and non-party members the ofcial Soviet stand on the Czechoslovak crisis. By 10 September, when the Party concluded the propaganda campaign, some 355,566 members and candidates had attended meetings. While dissenting voices were rather few, certainly in comparison with other republics on the western frontier, the populations frustration with the lack of information in the Soviet media turned into a thorny issue. Communists repeatedly complained that they were being fed rumours and not given full information. The Belorussian authorities insisted that such questions as Why is the standard of living in Czechoslovakia higher than in the Soviet Union, although socialism has yet to be built there? and Is it true that they teach scripture in Polish schools? Nevertheless, they launched an intensive propaganda campaign, especially when the information gap was lled by Estonian tourists who told locals that Estonia is smaller than Czechoslovakia, but we too want to live independently, or by Party members who objected to the invasion on the grounds that it was the same as what had happened to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia Dangerous past, messy present The unresolved issue of the rehabilitation of political convicts continued to blot the political landscape in the region. Rehabilitation committees operating under the auspices of the Supreme Soviet in each republic continued to plough through thousands of appeals, issuing amnesties but stopping short of the full rehabilitation of former nationalists or the restitution of their conscated property, and often curtailing their right to return to their former place of residence Their task was not made easier by the public mass rehabilitation of political convicts, the restitution of property and the prosecution of individual perpetrators of crimes in the early days of communist rule, advocated and partially implemented by 54 NARB 4/62/709/3, 12; 4/157/172/108Further unsettling perspectives were added by visiting Czechoslovak ofcials who condemned the biased Soviet reports on their country and Soviet interference in Czechoslovak domestic affairs, and praised the author of the 2,000 Words document, repeatedly noting the absence of democracy and freedom of speech in the Soviet Union. NARB 4/62/709/157, 142, 11112,000 Words, authored by Ludvik Maculik and signed by dozens of Czechoslovak dignitaries, called for peaceful, grass-root activities to advance the cause of reform and ght conservatives, and vowed to defend the reforms against foreign intervention by all means, including armsERAF 172/1/306/425, 59. 178 Contemporary European History the Czechoslovak Communist authorities and various political associations in spring 1968The rst secretary of the East Slovakian regional committee told his stunned Transcarpathian counterpart in late March 1968, turning ve decades of Soviet logic on its head, Czechoslovak comrades believe that full democracy requires the elimination of judicial proceedings and repression against citizens for their political views and statements, and the rehabilitation of all those who were repressed ... the State Security organs behaved improperly during the cult of personality . To ensure that there are no antagonistic classes in the country, the state security organs will be reduced to a minimum By 1968 popular retribution against perpetrators of the Stalinist purges seemed a far-fetched idea. With the notable exceptions of Beria and his close lieutenants who were tried and executed in camera as a part of the post-Stalin succession struggle, most of the perpetrators who survived the Stalin era appeared to endure de-Stalinisation cycles relatively peacefully and without visible displays of remorse. Still, Soviet Ukrainian state security ofcers could not remain indifferent when their Czechoslovak counterparts reported having to defend themselves against slanderous and hooligan elements without Party support or reported agents under public attack for their activities in the 1950s threatening to commit suicide. Reporting on a meeting with their Czechoslovak peers, west Ukrainian police could count on a sympathetic ear in Moscow, especially from Yuri Andropov. It was probably no accident that the report of 13 May 1968 bluntly raised the issue of Czechoslovak expectations of Soviet military assistance if a threat to socialism were ever to arise Ukrainian journalists who visited Czechoslovakia in May 1968 were struck by the popularity of the K-231 Club, an association named for the 1948 law for the defence of the republic that was used to convict people of political crimes. They allegedly sought to restore the good name of those destroyed or repressed by the agents of Beria, and a number of party ofcials committed suicide after being targeted as perpetrators, as an increasingly belligerent Shelest reported to MoscowA visiting Slovak Communist writer, Milo Krno, told his Ukrainian hosts that the club, which started with the modest goal of assisting in rehabilitation of those wrongly convicted, soon swelled into a mass anti-Soviet organisation engaging in the persecution of innocent pro-Soviet citizens. The same thing, came the ringing reminder, had 57 For a thorough portrayal of the rehabilitation question during the Prague Spring, see H. Gordon Skilling, Czechoslovakias Interrupted Revolution , 373 411, and the report by the Third Secretary of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on his discussion with the Czechoslovak Consul-General in Kiev in late April 1968 in Kramer, Ukraine and the SovietCzechoslovak Crisis of 1968 , 279.

Indeed, several ofcials, such as the deputy chairman of the Supreme Court, the head of investigation in the Prague security service, and the chief doctor at the Ruzyne prison where prisoners were tortured, committed suicide. Skilling, Czechoslovakias Interrupted Revolution, 232, 387. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 179 happened in Hungary, where they began by focusing on Rkosi and then shifted their attacks to the entire Party and government apparatus. Krno also related that members of another small club, named Clean Hands, demanded the arrest of all politicians involved in repression and had become fond of saying among themselves that democratisation will be completed when only two communists are left in Czechoslovakia and they end up killing each other. Many judges had supposedly committed suicide after realising that they had sentenced innocent people to death and the relatives of the dead were demanding vengeance The relatively free ow of information across the border guaranteed that ordinary Soviet citizens would soon join the debate. A teacher from Khust who returned from a visit to Czechoslovakia reportedly told his brother that he was struck to see that almost all the prisoners have been released from jails, and they are now publishing articles of a vehement anti-Soviet character in different newspapers and demanding friendship and co-operation with the Federal Republic of Germany. They write and tell their friends about the alleged torments, humiliations, and insults they had suffered Compensation for conscated property was an especially thorny issue in the Soviet western frontier region. Czechoslovak citizens informed visiting relatives from Transcarpathia that all political prisoners were being released and recovering their property, and that the Communists would be compelled to pay reparations If this were not enough, the Czechoslovak Communists appeared to violate a sacred Soviet taboo by publicly displaying paintings and photographs of politically disgraced gures. Ukrainian journalists who toured Czechoslovakia in May 1968 were allegedly dismayed to see in the Prague Museum of Lenin many portraits, family and ofcial photographs, documents and written material of Zinovev, Rykov, Trotsky, Radek, Stolypin, Guchkov, Rasputin, Tsar Nikolas II, Hitler, Mussolini and Mao Zedong, exclaimed an indignant ShelestAnd as always in this multi-ethnic region, the issue of rehabilitation was closely related to the threat of a nationalist revival. The enemies within In a speech in February 1968 Shelest lashed out at the treacherous counter-revolutionary elements of the Ukrainian diaspora who tried to administer the poison of nationalism to some of our own politically immature, ideologically wavering people. Chattering about a decline of culture and language, exclaimed Shelest, is rotten bait that could be swallowed only by a political blind man, a limited or prejudiced person, or various demagogues and degeneratesOn 28 March Shelest recorded in his diary a telephone call from the rst secretary of the Ivano-Frankivsk regional party committee, who told him that in certain districts former members 61 Kramer, Ukraine and the SovietCzechoslovak Crisis of 1968 , 31012TsDAHOU 1/25/28/157TsDAHOU 1/25/28/1567TsDAHOU 1/25/28/131Hodnett and Potichnyj, The Ukraine and the Czechoslovak Crisis, 82. 180 Contemporary European History of the Ukrainian nationalist underground had begun to turn up, amounting to over forty thousand in the region as a wholeIn May, a teacher in a middle school in the Rakhiv district was quoted as saying that theres not much time left before we settle accounts with those who are in power, and villagers from Onokivtsi allegedly stated that soon will come the time when theyll hang the moskali Similarly to 1956, the Czechoslovak crisis drove home the sense of isolation for Communists on the western frontier. Visits to Czechoslovakia brought party and non-party people face to face with downright contempt for their country, people and system. A Soviet delegation that toured Czechoslovakia on the occasion of the twenty-third anniversary of the liberation of the country from German occupation was fully aware that it was kept isolated by their hosts from any open interactions with ordinary citizens and even Communists. Candid discussions were held only during train or car rides, or when no one else was around. The behaviour of most of their hosts, especially the leaders of local party organisations, reected alarm about their own fate, reported delegation head Volodymyr ShcherbytskyiOther Soviet tourists were exposed to dismissive comments on the uselessness of twenty years of contacts with the Soviet Union, and some who encountered blatant resentment concluded, More people hate us than we even imagine ... the anticipated dispatch of the Soviet Army into Czechoslovakia unfortunate. It would lead to no good, and after this even more people would hate us. Quite probably such observations were compounded by encounters with local Soviet supporters of the Czechoslovak reforms who emphasised that Everywhere people hate the Russians. In Poland they threw thousands of the best people into prison because of their hatred for Russians. Romania is against the Russians. The Czechoslovaks have also changed the regime that subordinated them to the Russians. The Soviet regime in Czechoslovakia will be eliminated with the help of America Jews in the region attracted the authorities attention far more than they had in 1956. Although they did not pose a numerical or irredentist threat, Jews seemed to antagonise the party and the KGB, especially in western Ukraine. The visible role of several Jewish gures in the Prague Spring, such as Eduard Goldstcker, Frantiek Kriegel and Otaik, demands for the restoration of relations with Israel and condemnation of the current antisemitic campaign in Poland only fuelled the state anti-Jewish campaign already under way inside the Soviet Union. The condemnation by Czechoslovak writers of anti-Zionism as being thinly veiled antisemitism clearly violated a taboo in the domestic political arena, and strained relations with other countries in the socialist camp. KGB reports submitted to Shelest conveyed the 66 Shelest, Spravzhnii sud istorii shche poperedu, 25467 TsDAHOU 1/25/28/105TsDAHOU 1/25/28/1801TsDAHOU 1/25/28/1578, 153, 1545. Another local commended the Czechs who soon will move away from the moskali and rebuild their own country the way it was under Masaryk. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 181 impression that other East European security services, notably the Polish, considered the events in Czechoslovakia to be a Jewish-led affair Sustained by a steady diet of such reports as well as by his own biases, Shelest repeatedly lashed out at Zionist circles stirring things up in Czechoslovakia and in his own backyardHis diary entry of 9 April identied Jews as being behind a domino effect that threatened the Soviet bloc. A destabilisation campaign was supposedly directed by a Zionist centre in Brussels, headed by a Jewish philosophy professor and the Israeli ambassador to Belgium and consisting of bankers, industrialists and scientists. Once the war in Vietnam ended or abated, the United States and Israel would direct their attention to Eastern Europe, observed Shelest. The theory of bridge-building was born: enemy propaganda alleges that the different bridges will lead to the inevitable disintegration of the socialist camp, wrote the Ukrainian leader Beyond the blunt antisemitism, the Soviet authorities had some concrete concerns regarding the Jews. It did not help that individuals allegedly expressed expectations that were similar to Shelests anxieties. Jews who commented on the crisis often tied their observations to Soviet relations with Israel, a particularly thorny issue in the aftermath of 1967 war, the revival of Jewish cultural life and the growing international pressure on the Soviet Union to ease restrictions on emigration to Israel. Czechoslovakia will certainly break away from the Soviet Union, as Romania has already done. After that Poland and Hungary will go down the same path. This will weaken the socialist system, and capitalism will strengthen, all of which will benet Israel. Having broken away from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary will emulate Romania in establishing friendly relations with Israel, declared one Shulman from Khust, reecting widely held views in the regionA Jewish worker in Lviv had more realistic forecast: Trust my life experience theyll nish with Czechoslovakia and start tightening the screws on us Probably because of the peaceful course of events in Czechoslovakia prior to the invasion, the 1968 crisis revived memories of the 193940 annexations in the Baltic republics more than it did memories of 1956. Collective letters from workers in Czechoslovakia to their Estonian peers asked the latter to raise their heads in protest against the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the uninvited Soviet forces. There were no public protests on the scale of those some twelve years earlier, but things were certainly not quiet. Letters by students drew the analogy with the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 and others fanned rumours of numerous casualties suffered by 70 In his 9 May 1968 report to Shelest on the Czechoslovak media, Ilnytskyi paid special attention to Arnold Lustig, the Jewish writer who defended Israeli action in 1967 during a television broadcast. The head of the KGB Transcarpathian regional branch raised similar, and even more elaborate, charges on 14 May 1968. 71 See reports of his speeches before All-Union and republic party gatherings and in meetings with Czechoslovak leaders during the crisis in TsDAHOU 1/25/97/34; Hodnett and Potichnyj, The Ukraine and the Czechoslovak Crisis, 83, 105. 72 Shelest, Spavzhnii sud istorii shche poperedu, 255TsDAHOU 1/25/28/106, 1556TsDAHOU 1/25/39/26. 182 Contemporary European History the invading Soviet ArmyThe recipients of these letters may have been reluctant to embark on public or violent protests, but the allegations certainly touched a raw nerve. The writer Raimond Kaugver, who only two years earlier had caused an uproar with his book Forty Candles, in which his hero moved from the German and Finnish armies through the Gulag to a cosy job in the Soviet industrial sector, compared the invasion to the Hitlerite occupation of Estonia, and declared that he did not expect such an obtuse action. Grafti and leaets crying Russians, Get Out of Czechoslovakia!, Moscow! Hands Off Czechoslovakia!, and Down with the Red Munich! Long Live Free Czechoslovakia! appeared in Parnu, Kohtla and Tallinn in the days following the invasion. Some Party members, such as Anatolii Klachkov, were appalled by what they considered a resort to unnecessarily extreme measures that ran counter to world public opinion, including Communist parties. The Communist movement around the world will pay dearly for this hasty action Then there were those who shrugged off the Soviet claims as another charade, such as one former political convict from Tallinn, who wondered in what manner the Soviet intervention differed from the US intervention in VietnamIn Latvia there were shermen who went to sea wearing black armbands on the day of the invasion The Orthodox Church stoked the above-mentioned anxieties in western Ukraine over the rehabilitation of the Greek Catholic Church. An Orthodox priest in Prague warned the secretary of the Mukacheve diocese in Transcarpathia that In Eastern Slovakia the Uniates have risen again, which has inamed passions, as manifested by egoism, crude invective, and hatred of everything that comes from the east, even things that are objectively good ... If the government fully rescinds the 1950 decision to liquidate the Uniates in our country and does not restore the status quo that existed before 1 January 1968 as we propose, the Uniates will be fully re-established in all the parishes where they had operated earlier Other priests who visited Eastern Slovakia at the time conrmed his concerns. The Greek Catholic Church may not have recovered from the blows it was dealt in the aftermath of the war, but its adherents did not have a change of heart. In the light of the history of the Church and of the fact that many of its priests were previously incarcerated for nationalist activity, it seems plausible to assert that its public revival was one of the most troubling issues for the Soviet authoritiesA former priest who had found work in a factory in Mukacheve was quoted as praising the new Czechoslovak course. Said one Andrii Bitsko, 75 ERAF 1/301/151/5,7ERAF 1/301/151/21, 24, 26, 2930ERAF 1/301/151/29, 91Alexeyeva, Soviet Dissent, 98TsDAHOU 1/25/28/159For a thorough documentation of the impact of the Prague Spring on religious activities in Ukraine, and the struggle to legalise the Greek Catholic Church, see Volodymyr Dmytruk, Ukrana ne movchala , 171224, 2303, 2423, 25061, 2813, 2858. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 183 They aspire to a genuine democracy. Take any example you like. In the Soviet Union they banned the ringing of church bells because the noise would disturb the peace of the population and its leisure. Supersonic jets ying over the city make much more noise than the bells ever did, and the population has complained about it. But no one bans these ights ... Political events in Czechoslovakia will develop in the same way they did under Khrushchev after Stalin died A few months later Soviet anxieties grew exponentially. Reporting on sentiments among the clergy regarding the Czechoslovak events, the head of the Council on Religious Affairs of the Soviet Council of Ministers noted the sharp increase in the illegal nationalist activities of priests, monks and fanatical worshipers of the former Greek Catholic Church. Under the impact of the events across the border in Czechoslovakia and foreign radio broadcasts, believers resumed propagating an independent Ukraine and resistance to Russication by the Russian Orthodox Church. According to one Soviet ofcial, priests from the Transcarpathian region wrote to the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet that they would not cease their activities and would effect the restoration of their churchRhetoric aside, he had a point. In the villages of Drohobych region Uniate priests launched a door-to-door revival campaign, urging believers to follow the Czechoslovak example and restore the church through their own efforts. In an alarming threat to the social order, Uniate clergy began preaching against their counterparts in the Orthodox Church who had taken their positions after the forced merger in 1946 Interestingly enough, the abolition of collective farms was hardly an item on anyones agenda during the Czechoslovak reforms. By 1968 both regime and peasants had found a modus vivendi following the gradual improvement in cultural and living standards throughout the 1960s. Polls conducted in the Slovak countryside in July 1968 showed dissatisfaction with living conditions in comparison with the city and demands for rehabilitation of peasants who were victimised during collectivisation, but the process and the system themselves were not challenged. Still, with the rumour mill spinning, even the moderate changes negotiated in Czechoslovakia were enough to ignite traditional antagonisms to the collective farm system in the western provinces. Reecting the enduring sense of alienation after twenty-ve years of Soviet rule, a villager in Mizhhiria in the Transcarpathian region noted, In Czechoslovakia they want to establish the same type of regime that exists in Yugoslavia, i.e., to distribute land to the peasants and disband the collective farms. In the Soviet Union, they are also liquidating collective farms. Why should things have to remain along the lines that Stalin set up?84 Evidently, the events across the border were reviving dormant resentments throughout the western frontier lands. I thank Mark Kramer for forwarding me this documentTsDAHOU 1/25/33/867TsDAHOU 1/25/28/105. On the politics of the Czechoslovak countryside in 1968, see Skilling, Czechoslovakias Interrupted Revolution, 58592. 184 Contemporary European History Young rebels, aging revolution In a revealing outburst at the conclusion of the communist bloc leaders meeting in Warsaw on 1415 July 1968, Brezhnev sounded particularly agitated in criticising Czechoslovak leaders plans to admit 200,000 or 300,000 young people to the ranks of the Communist Party in order to give an aging party a healthy injection. Not only did he nd the comment insulting, but given the manifest attitudes of the Czechoslovak youth, such a move is intended to bury and not rejuvenate the party, said the Soviet leader Indeed, the Czechoslovak crisis brought Soviet leaders an unpleasant reality check. The geriatric would-be champions of youth and vigour were now reminded by the most receptive audience for liberalised socialism students just how pass their own revolutionary rhetoric had become, especially in the trouble spots of the western frontier and the Georgian republic. In sharp contrast to many of their counterparts in the Russian Federation who often opined that During the war we sacriced 150,000 boys to save the Czechs from the Germans. And now they want to disown us?,86 non-Russian students were visibly agitated by the course of events. This, as Mark Kramer pointedly notes, was especially disheartening for a regime that was preparing to celebrate fty years of the Youth League Along the entire stretch of the frontier, authorities were concerning themselves with restless students. In early April, for example, Shelest conded to his diary his worries about outsiders agitating at the Taras Shevchenko State University in Kiev. A day after the invasion a student made an extraordinary telephone call in which he disavowed Soviet reports and pledged that Ukrainian youth would follow the Czechoslovak example. This was not an isolated reaction The partys rhetoric with regard to the impact of the Prague Spring on youth revealed a body overtly anxious about its own biological and ideological aging. Throughout 1968, and especially after the invasion, Komsomol leaders expressed concerns over the relentless campaign by the imperialists and their pitiful lackeys to revive nationalism among Soviet Ukrainian youth, and more pointedly to shake the faith in the older generation. Unwittingly, Party leaders confessed to the impotence of their indoctrination that, without living experience to back it up, appeared rather amorphous: The boys and girls who have not been enriched with the experience of class struggle, who have not been armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, are easily wounded by the poisoned arrows of bourgeois propaganda. The events in Czechoslovakia have only conrmed this. Our task is not only to instil in youth immunity to the lies of Western radio, but also to turn them into active ghters against all 85 Navrtil, The Prague Spring 1968, 2245Natan Sharansky, Fear No Evil, trans.

Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 185 sorts of displays of bourgeois ideology, patriots endlessly devoted to the Fatherland, internationalists fully committed to Lenins goals The ensuing campaign to reclaim the youth of the republic bore all the traditional ingredients of Soviet crisis management, but with the addition of some intriguing new features. The Komsomol was purged down to the lower ranks and then given an enhanced role in educational institutions. The organisation celebrated as a model the rector of one of Lvivs higher education institutes who built bridges to the student body by engaging them in discussions on any topic, Ukrainian nationalism included, and integrated the students into the daily running of the institution As in 1956, Baltic universities stood out as the sites of the largest and best-organized anti-Soviet protests, albeit on a smaller scale. Students there successfully capitalised on an available organisational infrastructure, their relatively close contact with the outside world, their exposure to interwar political culture through the remaining older faculty, the relatively loose political control over academic and intellectual life in the republics, especially in Estonia and, equally important, the living memory of the mass protests in 1956. During a carnivalesque parade of the fourth Students Day in Tartu on 1920 October 1968, students displayed sarcastic banners: Long Live the Gentle Foreign Policy of the Soviet Union!, splattered with blood stains; Viru Valge, Yes! Moscow Special, No! a not-so-tacit rebuke to things Russia which played on a popular vodka; Twins for Every Estonian Woman! a reference to concerns over the decline of Estonians share in the republics population; and, nally, Long live the Great Marxist Lentsmann! combined with a banner that read Clean Up the Estonian language! mocking both the veteran communist leader and local leaderships poor command of the indigenous language. Students of the Estonian Agricultural Academy waved a poster that read Yankees, Get Behind Peipsi! . Some Soviet banners and portraits of Lenin were defaced and hooligans whistled when a Russian song was played during a concert in the Town Hall Square The partys reaction was intriguing. Speakers at the universitys party cell that met to discuss the incidents three weeks later were split in their assessment of the occurrences, which in itself constituted a distinct Estonian line. Some opted for a tough stand and advocated expulsion and urged professors to identify the enemy in the course of academic work. Others sought a measured response, pointing to the generally satisfactory state of affairs on campus, but more intriguingly based their arguments on just how far the political landscape had migrated in the course of the preceding decade: The students are young, quick-witted, active in political life and possess useful enthusiasm for everything. After all, we cannot ban everything. We might risk overdoing it, opined one party member. There was a time, observed another, 89 Hodnett and Potichnyj, The Ukraine and the Czechoslovak Crisis, 109Ibid., 110, 152,nERAF 151/12/172/878, 90, 94. 186 Contemporary European History when a combination of certain colours bothered certain people. But nowadays, fabrics and clothing are printed in these colours and no one pays attention. That time is probably behind us.

If we had received an ofcial statement that it was an error, I would have condemned the slogan. But since we remained silent about the issue, we have no basis for saying that such a banner was inappropriate. Indeed, the authorities appeared eager to let the involved students off the hook, accepting at face value expressions of bewilderment that such banners were perceived to be offensive, and content with the expulsion of only two students who had openly declared their opposition to the regime. And just as they had done in 1956 and their Ukrainian counterparts were doing at the same time, the Estonians were forced to address again the volatile issue of the de facto separation of Estonian and Russian students. The dean and the departments were urged to forge contacts between the two through sharing information and organising joint activities, such as lectures, eld trips and vacation camps Still, the above initiatives could not conceal the visible strains between an aging revolution and a leadership ghting to preserve its life achievements at home and abroad, and a rather confused younger generation simultaneously proud of their fathers sacrices and accomplishments, especially in the international arena, yet detached from the formative experiences of the founding fathers, and searching for a more inspirational existence than that offered by the regime, yet beset primarily by material concerns. And the regime responded in kind, offering commitment for material improvement in exchange for unchallenged political and ideological hegemony. This was certainly not the most exciting solution but, if the next two decades were any indication, a remarkably stable one. At least as long as the regime could deliver the goods. Useful memories Despite the consternation that engulfed the region, the western frontier did not erupt in the way in which it had some twelve years earlier. The reasons for the relative stability were anchored in the Soviet reaction to the events in Czechoslovakia and the changes in the region over the previous decade. For one thing, the military intervention was launched before events got out of control and evolved into a full-scale armed uprising. Second, this time around there was no young and violent constituency similar to the returning nationalist guerrillas and underground activists who tried to seize the moment in 1956. Moreover, just as the living memory of the Second World War and brutal civil war that followed it were powerful enough for many to suppress the thirst for more 92 ERAF 151/12/172/8991, 1036; 151/12/191/23, 8, 1011. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 187 blood, so the memory of the violent crushing of the Hungarian uprising subdued for most the enthusiasm for a similarly risky adventure. Communist Czechoslovaks, including those apprehensive about the course of events, repeatedly went out of their way to assure anxious Soviet Ukrainian counterparts that current events were not a repetition of the events in Hungary 1956, which had allegedly been popular mass uprising against the party; now they were witnessing an inner-party backlash against conservatives Transcarpathians supportive of the Czechoslovak reforms were impressed by what they considered to be the skilful Czechoslovak avoidance of the Hungarian trap, at least for the time being. The Czechs were a cultured people who, in contrast to the Hungarians, would struggle for democracy through other means, noted a worker who returned from a family visit in Czechoslovakia. The friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia hindered the development of Czechoslovakia, as it did earlier with Hungary, observed a schoolteacher from Mukacheve. The only difference is that the Czechs are much wiser than the Hungarians were in 1956.The Czechs have taken power into their own hands without any bloodshed, and are acting very intelligently. They havent done all that much for now, but theyll gradually be able to do more. Everything is being done to establish the same kind of regime that existed in Masaryks timeBoth were oblivious to the fact that it was not the means but the essence of Czechoslovak reforms that spelled their doom. But the appeal of a peaceful course was evident. Regional leaders kept reminding their constituencies that despite changes in tactics imperialist forces had the same unacceptable goals in mindWell before the August invasion some locals had already concluded that military measures were preferable to revisiting 1956. Most important is that what happened in Hungary in 1956 does not take place in Czechoslovakia ... The Soviet Union should not sit on sidelines of such events, observed an engineer from Transcarpathia will be a very timely measure, stated an academic in Uzhorod in May 1968. It will eliminate any possible repetition of the events that took place in Hungary in 1956. The presence of Soviet troops will sober up the frenzied representatives of anti-socialist circles who want to restore the old order to Czechoslovakia Equally important, authorities drew on the role of the Second World War in the lives and memories of locals. It was a controversial event in regional memory. Though associated by most with the Soviet occupations of 1939 and 1944, it was also the Great Patriotic War for growing numbers of newcomers. Whereas a hard core of nationalist activists had been driven out of the region and dispersed throughout the Union, Soviet veterans who were populating the region in increasing numbers were also at the helm of local power. It was within this cohesive, cross-national cohort 93 TsDAHOU 1/25/27/22TsDAHOU 1/25/28/1556See Shelests speech at the party meeting in Kiev on 25 Apr. 1968 in TsDAHOU 1/125/97/3462, especially l, 20, 423TsDAHOU 1/25/28/103TsDAHOU 1/25/28/109. 188 Contemporary European History that the authorities found a substantial source of support during the 1968 crisis. For these people, the war was a source of pride, the launching pad of civilian careers, or just a new start in a new region. In their world, the international status achieved by the Soviet Union in the wake of the war was indistinguishable from their personal standing in their respective communities. The territorial gains of the war were etched in personal memories and blood. Moreover, the Czechoslovaks kept repeating the mantra of gratitude felt to the Soviet Union for liberating them from the Fascist yoke, as did a workers delegation visiting Ukraine in May for the commemoration of the twenty-third anniversary of the liberation of CzechoslovakiaBut when a speaker at a party conference in Prague stated that the Czechoslovaks were grateful to the Soviet Army for liberating them in 1945, but would not want to see it on their territory now, the distinction did not register well with the SovietsIf the Czechs have forgotten who liberated them in 1945, they must be reminded of this through the introduction of our troops onto their territory, What an outrage! The counter-revolutionary elements are shooting at soldiers whose fathers brought Czechoslovakia freedom and peace, and saved her from the brown plague of Fascism, were two of many similar views expressed in private conversations in Lviv during the mobilisation of reservists Belorussian veterans were equally adamant. Averred one in Hrodna, Our people are related by a centuries-old friendship. As a participant in the liberation of Czechoslovakia, I personally witnessed the respect and love soviet soldiers met in Czechoslovakia ... The situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia worries us Communists and party activists. Therefore I propose the following motion: Ask the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU to take the most decisive measures for the normalisation of the situation in Czechoslovakia. I liberated Czechoslovakia in 1945, and if it is necessary, I will join the battle again, in order to prevent the restoration of capitalism in Czechoslovakia, declared another. Others fondly recalled the common struggle against the Nazis, especially of Slovak partisan units that operated in Beloruss, a valuable political asset in a place that embodied popular resistance to the Nazis Estonian veterans echoed these sentiments. A school principal in Mustvee who had been in Prague on Victory Day and had recently returned there as a tourist recalled that on both occasions he was warmly welcomed by Czechs and Slovaks. So how come they now tolerate this wild anti-Soviet outburst and fail to restrain the enemies of socialism in their country, wondered Comrade Rusak. Others were angered by the ungrateful Czechoslovaks who forgot that the Soviet people shed blood for their freedom and assisted them daily in all spheres of life; they vowed 98 TsDAHOU 1/25/30/15TsdAHOU 1/25/30/208TsDAHOU 1/25/28/108; 1/25/39/25. This rhetoric was not limited to veterans. Students in Uzhorod also pointed to those in Czechoslovakia who forgot about the year of 1939, Munich, and that without the help of the Soviet Army Czechoslovakia could not have become independent. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 189 to do all they could to defend the friendship sealed in blood in the ght against fascism. Russian veterans in Estonia bitterly blamed the Czechoslovak leadership for violating the eternal friendship between the two Slavic peoplesThe rhetoric of the Soviet mans burden that began to emerge in the course of the 1956 events was now fully developed. The Soviet sacrice for the defeat of the Nazi menace bought it permanent, uncontested rights over the territories and people they had acquired in the wake of this historical feat. With still-fresh images of Soviet tanks rolling westward a year earlier, the rst secretary of the Estonian Central Committee asked the commander of the Leningrad Military District on 4 August 1969 to donate a T-34 tank on the occasion of the twenty-fth anniversary of the liberation of the town of Parnu from the Nazi occupation. The tank, wrote Kabin, would be used as a monument honouring the tank battalion that liberated the town on 23 September 1944For some, Soviet tanks rolling to the west were the face of occupation. For others they were the face of liberation. The latter, however, held the political reins. Much like the Hungarian crisis of 1956, the Czechoslovak crisis of 1968 both delayed and accelerated fundamental changes in the composition of the Soviet Union and its empire. The decade started with Vasilii Aksenovs celebration of Tallinn as Russias abroad. By the end of the decade, however, Aksenovs band of intellectual and social drifters, increasingly embittered and disillusioned, operated in Russia proper. In between, they endured the brutal harassment by the Komsomol vigilante patrols, futile attempts to t in ideologically, several thaws and biting freezes. But they were nally burnt by 1968, as the title of Aksenovs masterpiece alluded. The rape of Czechoslovakia that summer and the crackdown on dissent nally forced Aksenov and his protagonists to abandon their pervasive youthful optimism. For the scores of Russians in a bar, there was nothing exotic about the peoples of the western frontier; they were Gypsy-like Moldavian and Latvian sons of bitches. And the marginals, singing Okudzhavas Paper Soldiers in the streets of Moscow and still believing in their heart of hearts that they would prevail, were nally overwhelmed by the reactions to the invasion: One day, during a night of falling stars, in the early hours of a morning the colour of dill pickles, with surly, dumb astonishment, Unanimous Approval occupied a fraternal socialist country to ensure that it was no longer fraternal but safely under its skin. Some wanted to rush on to the streets in protest; others were shocked that the boys on the tanks were our boys, who applauded us, who read our books; there were also those who condemned Dubek for adventurism and blamed Czechs without discrimination for their arrogance What did they expect? Did they really think they could have what we wont have?104 102 ERAF 1/301/151/43, 51, 75. 104 Aksenov, Ozhog, 121, 3645. 190 Contemporary European History Fittingly, Aksenovs role as contemporary Russian chronicler of Tallinn was lled by the mercilessly sarcastic Sergei Dovlatov. The title of Dovlatovs autobiographical tales said it all: The Compromise. Gone was the pervasive optimism of the early 1960s. Cruel sarcasm replaced the passionate, good-natured portrayals of the Estonians and their guests. It was still a foreign place, whither one ed hoping to nd quiet life without thinking, populated by straight-talking, businesslike, practical locals. But beyond that, life was a faade and was recognised as such by both the regime and a consciously compromising populace. It was a place where the four-hundred-thousandth inhabitant of Tallinn could be announced only when proper parents Estonian and Russian were nally found ; where a celebrated model Communist woman worked on her marriage with the help of the Technology of Sex manual, a hired lover, and tight schedule that did not interfere with her career plans; and where Leonid Brezhnev responded to a letter he had not received from a record-breaking milkmaid who had never written to him about the record that no one could verify or cared about all concocted in the midst of drinking and sex binges by local party bosses and journalists. And above all hovered a sense of resigned acceptance, because this is the only life there is. When Dovlatov asked a Russian who had stayed in Estonia after wartime service whether he did not feel that all this was happening to someone else ... that its some kind of idiotic play and were just the spectators, the latter responded: Dont think. Just dont think, and thats it. I havent thought for about fteen years ... if only one could fall asleep and not wake upOne tried to muddle through, manipulate circumstances and oat through ones existence as best one could, because one thing was beyond doubt: the numbing Soviet order was there to stay. This state of affairs was accentuated by a series of self-immolations by young people: rst a Ukrainian , then a Latvian , and nally the nineteen-year-old student worker Romas Kalanta, who ignited himself on14 May 1972 in front of the theatre where Soviet power in Lithuania was proclaimed in 1940 and under the banner Freedom for Lithuania. This suicide traumatised both authorities and population and triggered three more self-immolations as well as mass demonstrations by students and workers with anti-Soviet slogans, attacks on police personnel, extensive property damage and mass arrests. Not least, it forced the local authorities to address the issue in public, in itself a sign of the changing times The self-immolations only highlighted the sense of despair and hopelessness that engulfed the western frontier following the crushing of the Prague Spring. They were, in a sense, the swansong of the bygone era of violent resistance. By and large, political protest was already being channelled to the less dramatic, gradual and 105 Sergei Dovlatov, The Compromise, trans. 106 Thomas Remeikis, Opposition to Soviet Rule in Lithuania, 19451980 (Chicago: The Institute of Lithuanian Studies Press, 1980), 11819, 2929; Alexeyeva, Soviet Dissent, 38. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 191 legalistic dissident methods of mass petitions and samizdat publications that challenged the regime to live up to its formal constitutional obligations Foreign broadcasts, especially from Scandinavia, continued to haunt the authorities. By the mid-1970s, a powerful new station in Helsinki had already dominated the airwaves of northern districts of Estonia with news reports and lms from the West. Reluctantly, the authorities admitted that a signicant portion of the population were tuning in. The measures advocated to counter the impact of the Finnish broadcasts said it all: in addition to improving reception for central and Estonian television broadcasts, the Estonian ofcials advised the screening of Soviet and foreign lms, enhancing the quality of colour broadcasts, intensifying propaganda on the Soviet way of life, and instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey Soviet concerns to the Finns over unfriendly broadcastsAgainst the all too visible thirst for information, the poverty of Soviet broadcasts, and the changes the republic endured in the course of the last two decades, one could justiably wonder whether the Estonian ofcials had a different place and era in mind. In the nal analysis, however, they were not necessarily unrealistic. At this point, Soviet power in the western frontier regions had already come to rest on routine, consumerism and the tacit understanding by all interested parties that any meaningful change in the system would emanate from Moscow. The brutal suppression of the Prague Spring led many in the western frontier regions to view the different conditions prevailing in the neighbouring socialist satellites as a problem and not necessarily as an inspiring model. When labour unrest swept Poland in late 1970, Belorussian informants concurred that the source of the problems lay in Polands failure to collectivise. People who had lived in Poland and saw with their own eyes how the new kulak grows and prospers, wondered why Polish authorities did not take decisive measures to solve the agrarian problem, while others noted that the events in Poland were not solely internal affairsApparently, the lessons of 1968 were thoroughly digested. The invasion of Czechoslovakia practically sealed off irredentist rhetoric and policies in the borderlands. Despite the temporary radicalisation of anti-Soviet sentiments by tourists from neighbouring countries , the invasion clearly cooled tempers. Even the hawkish Shelest admitted that the Romanians had changed their course. The Party organisations in the border regions informed their superiors that they had learned that Romanian ofcials advised their citizens prior to setting off to Soviet regions to avoid confrontations with Soviet people. Indeed, tourists began to conduct themselves more tactfully than in preceding 107 A case in point was the petition of some 17,000 signatures submitted to the United Nations and the Kremlin in protest at the trials of three priests who carried out religious teaching among young people.

This went hand in hand with the resumption of instruction in the Russian language and distribution of Soviet journals in RomaniaThe invasion had its impact. True, Romanian irredentism continued to irritate the Soviets well into the 1970s. Pantelimon Halippa, the former leader of the Bessarabian government, was rehabilitated in Romania and was living on a generous pension in Bucharest, enjoying close relations with the current leadership and propagating Romanian rights to Bessarabia and other neighbouring territories, Shelest informed MoscowThe visits of Romanian artistic groups to Soviet Moldavia provoked nationalist sentiments and attracted large crowds of youngsters chanting Brothers, Brothers. In autumn that year public buildings in Chisenau were painted with slogans such as Russians Go Home, Moldavia for Moldavians, and We Want to be with Romania In June 1973 the Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi regional committees informed the Central Committee in Kiev about the chauvinistic bacchanalia that engulfed commemorations of the 125th anniversary of the 1848 revolution in the city of Iasi. In comments that were omitted in the press, Ceausescu referred to occupation by the moskali and the threat from the east. This speech, and inammatory broadcasts like it, could easily be heard throughout the border districts of Ukraine, as Voldymyr Shcherbytskyi informed MoscowRomanian historians continued to push the envelope by referring to the 1940 annexation as the amputation of national territory and a violent, illegal act imposed on a helpless, isolated state. Romanian tourists in Ukraine still chattered about Mao having promised Ceausescu the help of two million soldiers in case of Soviet aggression, or that China would push a plebiscite on the return to Romania of Bessarabia and Bukovina through the United Nations. At the end of the day, however, it was the restrained Soviet reaction that stood out With the ratication of the existing borders in Helsinki in 1975 and the realisation after the invasion of Czechoslovakia that irredentist claims were directed inward rather than towards the borderlands diasporas, Soviet ofcials adopted a more measured approach to such proclamations. Pressure from Moscow, including the tacit incitement of Hungarian irredentist claims on Romania, persuaded Ceausescu to deny any territorial claims on the Soviet Union and to drop the identication of Moldavians as Romanians. This dispute, acknowledged the Romanian leader, merely concerned matters of scientic accuracy and historical truth. Mutual visits by Ceausescu and Bodiul to Chisinau and Bucharest, respectively, signalled a certain closureThe sense of resignation was apparent when Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, visited Bucharest in 1978 for another round of mutual accusations. You have territorial demands regarding the Soviet Union, red Gromyko. Yes, Andrei Andreevich, replied Paul Niculescu-Mizil, the Head of 111 TsDAHOU 1/15/258/3,27. 112 TsDAHOU 1/24/6313/23Dima, From Moldavia to Moldova, 53. 116 Dima, From Moldavia to Moldova, 567. Prague Spring, Romanian Summer and Soviet Autumn 193 the Propaganda Department at the Romanian Central Committee, We would like to have Bessarabia back. But do you think we can have it back? No, this is impossible, said Gromyko. Then, you see, Andrei Andreevich, countered Niculescu-Mizil. Politics is not what we want, what is possible. It is the art of possible. Do you think we are so stupid that we do not understand it is impossible? We only ask you to stop saying that there are two peoples: the Romanians and the Moldavians. We ask you to stop saying that there are two languages the Romanian and the Moldavian. In private, however, he conceded that the controversy should be limited to the academic sphere. Raising the political aspect of the Bessarabian question would have led to tragic consequences, as indeed happened in 1989 By 1974, relations between Hungary and the Hungarian minority in the Transcarpathian region, which numbered over 150,000 and was so restless in 1956, were celebrated as a model of cross-border nationality policy in the socialist bloc. The Hungarian press and tourists were quoted as praising the freedom of the community to converse and study in Hungarian, and contrasting it, of course, with the forced Romanianisation of the Hungarian regions under Ceausescu. The newly gained tranquillity was further exemplied by the presence of some 1,900 one-time members of Hungarian nationalist parties, fascist organisations and military ofcers, who had been quite active in 1956 but were now silentWith Jnos Kdr at the helm and two invasions in the background, few, if any, in the region had a taste for irredentist illusions and experiments. The 1956 crisis had concluded with the re-emergence of class as an operational sociopolitical category. The Czechoslovak crisis followed suit, this time with implications for the international arena as well. In his blistering attacks on Ukrainian nationalism during and after the Czechoslovak crisis, Shelest reminded his audiences inside and outside Ukraine of Lenins creed that the conduct of nationality policy must be subordinated to the interests of the building of socialism and communism, and that no Communist could forget about the class nature of the communist movement and the socialist system, especially Ukrainian Communists who had always struggled to build bridges to other fraternal nationalities. The same applied to Czechoslovak circumstances where proletarian internationalism and mutual aid were sacriced, albeit momentarily, for an illusory special pathHerein lay the essence of the Brezhnev Doctrine that connected everyone by means of a socialist umbilical cord. National sovereignty continued to trouble the Soviet regime both at home and in its East European empire. And time and again, it was the principled class-based assessment of ongoing events that allowed the Soviets to penetrate the ethno-national wall and remould the arena at their will. Class not only mattered; it was the primary ideological tool in the intricate Soviet political system. 117 Niculescu-Mizil, O istorie traita, 545. 118 TsDAHOU 1/25/868/6869; 660/4, 68. 119 See Shelests speeches on 25 April 1968 in TsDAHOU 1/25/97/3462 and on 23 November 1968 in TsDAHOU 1/1/2076/5065. 194 Contemporary European History The Soviet handling of the Czechoslovak crisis in 1968 was symptomatic of the entire Soviet experience. Soviet leaders had to reconcile the imprints of their formative experience of constant struggle against alleged external and internal enemies whose being was claimed to be an existential threat to the polity, with the acute awareness that they possessed the power and knowledge to handle the Czechoslovak and Romanian challenges. The Soviets exhibited both condence and profound anxiety while walking the ne line between Brezhnevs acknowledgment that the impact of the Czechoslovak crisis was limited to specic segments of groups and regions, such as students in Lviv, Moscow and Leningrad, and the melodramatic warnings by Shelest that nothing less than the fate of the socialist camp was at stake. The result was a brutal crackdown on dissent inside and outside the Union and a partial rehabilitation of Stalin, advanced notably by Shelest, yet stopping short of a full revival of the February 1948 methods, namely the full-blown re-Stalinisation of the region The Soviet invasion and the Brezhnev Doctrine that tied all members of the Socialist bloc in a tighter ideological knot applied to the western frontier as well. Any change was bound to start and work through Moscow, as indeed happened some twenty years later when a new and clueless General Secretary of the Communist Party, who experienced rst-hand the complete loss of Soviet legitimacy in the wake of the invasion, launched his own Moscow Spring, ignited the frontier, and brought down the Soviet house 120 Pikhoia, Sovetskii Soiuz, 311, 342. When Brezhnev consulted with Shelest in late October 1969 whether Stalins ninetieth birthday should be mentioned in the press, the latter retorted that keeping silence on such an important gure in Soviet history, in the labour of the people and in the victory over fascism would amount to falsication of history. In the Politburo meeting on 19 December, the overwhelming majority sided with Shelest, overruling only two objectors, Suslov and Ponomarev.

7b8f3602-64a1-41ef-b59a-0da60cd7cbb5,"The de-Stalinization process and the subsequent liberalization in the mid-1950s was a phenomenon of global communism. While acknowledging that Moscow was the most important source of this political change, this article challenges the Moscow-centric interpretation of de-Stalinization, which often ignores or underestimates sources of political change other than those initiated in Moscow. It examines China's role in the liberalization process in Eastern Europe and North Vietnam by revealing direct Chinese influence in these lands and by discussing parallels between these countries and China. The Eastern European and Vietnamese cases indicate that the China connection played an important role independent from Moscow in de-Stalinization. The article also suggests an Asian pattern of de-Stalinization represented by Chinese and Vietnamese intellectuals' dissent, as opposed to mass protest and even revolt represented by the Polish-Hungarian incident. THE YEARS 1956 and 1957 marked the first serious crisis in global communism during the Cold War with many significant events. Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech at the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956 revealing Stalin's crimes shocked the communist world and initiated a course of de-Stalinization, which soon led to challenges to the communist system itself, as the revolts in Poland and Hungary in October and November 1956 demonstrated. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, although violent eruption of political protest was largely absent, inner party debates and intellectual dissent were common, accompanied by sporadic strikes of workers and students. In Asian communist countries, the intellectual dissent and criticism of the party became conspicuous in China, especially in the spring of 1957, during the Double-Hundred movement and the Rectification period, with a few cases of workers' strikes and student protests. In North Vietnam the intellectuals directly challenged the party during the so-called Nhan Van/Giai Pham period in the fall of 1956, coupled with the peasant rebellion in Nghe-An Province and turbulence in the cities. The Hungarian revolution was suppressed in November 1956, and the entire atmosphere of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe underwent dramatic change. As Chinese intellectuals were still encouraged to criticize the party in the spring of 1957, however, Vietnamese intellectuals resumed their criticism of the regime as well. In June 1957, however, China launched the antiRightist campaign and ended the so-called ""liberalization,"" and so did Vietnam after the new year of 1958. Thus a cross-communist world crisis was overcome. In narrating and analyzing the above events, historians have most commonly relied on a Moscow-centric framework of interpretation. Most historians treat Moscow-the CPSU's Twentieth Congress in particular-as the center of political change while putting other communist countries on the periphery. These peripheral states initially responded to Moscow with shock and confusion, but soon many of them began to exploit this opportunity to assert their reformist thinking, which might otherwise have been difficult to justify. This Moscowcentric framework of interpretation largely reflects historical truth, given the influence and the leading role of the USSR in world communism of the time and the basic chronological order of events. But it is necessary, however, in applying any broad interpretational framework to history, to remain on alert against its blind spots. The main problem of the Moscow-centric framework is the tendency to ignore and underestimate sources of political change other than those initiated in Moscow and those connections and interactions not necessarily centered in Moscow. This in some cases leads to oversimplification of a complicated historical situation and misinterpreting the connections and interactions among communist countries. This article examines the process of de-Stalinization, or liberalization, from a perspective based on the China connection in Eastern Europe and Vietnam, which has been either underestimated or left out in many Moscow-centric narrativesThe term ""China connection"" means either a direct Chinese influence or parallels between these countries and China. The article presents and connects two cases. The first is the Chinese influence in some Eastern European countries, and even the Soviet Union as well, from 1955 to 1958. The second is Vietnamese intellectuals' challenge to the regime and the regime's response, both of which show interesting parallels between the two countries. The China connection in both the Eastern European and the Vietnamese cases clearly indicates a different source contributing to de-Stalinization and even suggests an expanded time frame of such turbulence from as early as 1955 to as late as 1958 , thus enriching our understanding of the global communist crisis with broader sources and longer duration. THE EASTERN EUROPEAN case For most historians, China's significant influence in Eastern Europe after Stalin's death began with its role in solving political crises there in October and November I950Briefly speaking, when Moscow decided to put down the Polish workers' uprising in mid-October 1956 by using force, Beijing opposed the decision on the grounds that the Polish problem was caused mainly by ""big-power chauvinism"" instead of Western antisocialist conspiracy. On the contrary, when Moscow was wavering between using force and a hands-off policy in face of the Hungarian crisis at the very end of October, Beijing urged Moscow to send its troops into Budapest. According to some Chinese sources made available in the late 19905, from 19 to 31 October 1965, a time in which the Polish-Hungarian crisis reached its peak, communication and discussion between Moscow and Beijing were unusually constant and intense. On 19 October, after the Polish party elected Wladislaw Gomulka, whose attitude toward Moscow was considered to be very dubious by the Kremlin, as its new leader, Pavel Yudin, the Soviet ambassador to China, informed Beijing of the grave situation in Warsaw, implying the strong possibility that the Soviet military would intervene in Poland. Mao Zedong immediately convened an enlarged politburo meeting and decided not to endorse any military intervention led by Moscow. The next day Mao summoned Yudin and asked him to convey the decision of the Chinese Communist Party to Moscow immediately and ""word by word."" On 21 October Mao again summoned the Soviet ambassador, expressed the same concern, and also voiced his discontent with Khrushchev's attack on Stalin, which the Chinese had attributed to the crisis. In the meantime, the situation in Hungary became more strained and Moscow no longer thought that the ambassador channel was efficient and authoritative enough. At Moscow's request, therefore, a Chinese delegation led by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping went to Moscow on 23 October and stayed there until 31 October, when Russian tanks entered Budapest. During the stay the Chinese delegation was informed of developments in Hungary and was consulted by Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders on a daily basis. Members even attended the emergency meetings of the presidium of the CPSU on 24 and 26 October. The most critical moments came on 29 and 30 October. On the evening of 29 October, Khrushchev and other Russian leaders met the Chinese in their residence and told them both Poland and Hungary were asking Moscow to withdraw its army from their countries. While insisting Moscow should change its ""big-power chauvinism"" attitude toward other communist countries, Liu Shaoqi said that under current circumstances it would be better for the Soviet army to remain and combat the antirevolutionaries. During the conversation the Chinese delegation received a call from Mao, whose suggestion was different from Liu's. Mao said that it was the time for Moscow to withdraw its army from the two countries and let them be independent. Liu accepted Mao's suggestion and conveyed it to Khrushchev. The next day, however, the Chinese delegation received a situation report from the Soviet leadership. The report was written by Anastas Mikoyan, the Soviet first deputy premier and skillful communicator between Moscow and other communist states, who had been sent to Hungary before the Chinese delegation arrived in Moscow. The report stated that since 29 October, with the withdrawal of the Soviet army from Budapest and dissolution of the Hungarian security force, the Hungarian capital and many other parts of the country had been in chaos, and antirevolutionaries were killing communists. The Chinese delegation was taken by surprise. After a whole day of discussion, they concluded that the nature of the Hungarian development was different from that of the Polish, so the Soviet army needed to reenter the capital and crush the antirevolutionaries. Then in the evening Liu Shaoqi called Mao. Mao changed his earlier stand that the Russians should leave and agreed with the delegation's conclusion, hecause, in addition to Liu's report, he had been receiving daily situation reports from Hungary written by Ho Deqing, the Chinese ambassador, and Hu Jibang, chief correspondent of the People's Daily in Budapest. But he said it would be better if the Russians would wait a while to let more antirevolutionaries expose themselves-a typical Maoist tactic later on used to smoke out China's Rightists. After calling Mao, the Chinese requested an emergency meeting with the Russians. In the meeting, Liu Shaoqi, vice chairman of the CCP's central committee, strongly suggested that Khrushchev not ""give up"" in Hungary but make more efforts to save the situation, while Deng Xiaoping, the general secretary of the CCP, explicitly urged that the Russian army return to the capital and seize the government. He told the Chinese that since the situation had changed considerably in Hungary, the return of the Russian army would mean an occupation of the country and the Russians would be regarded as conquerors. Therefore Soviet leadership, Khrushchev told the Chinese, had decided not to send its troops back. Since the Russians had made the decision, the Chinese did not go further to assert their opinions. Instead Liu said to the Russians, jokingly, that yesterday we tried to pursue you to withdraw but you did not agree; today you came and tried to pursue us to agree with your decision to withdraw. All people in the meeting laughed. Then Liu told the Russians that the Chinese delegation would return to Beijing the next evening. But the next evening, 31 October, the Chinese delegation received a call from the Kremlin just before departure for the airport. The Russian leaders asked the Chinese to arrive the airport one hour earlier than scheduled to have an emergency meeting. At the airport, the Chinese met Khrushchev and other Russian leaders. Khrushchev told them the Russian leadership had changed its mind overnight and decided to send troops back to Budapest. Excited, Liu Shaoqi said that the Chinese were glad that now the Russian leadership had taken a stand to defend socialism. In fact, before the airport meeting, the Russian army had already moved back toward the Hungarian capital Moscow's vacillation, reflected in the Chinese account, in solving the Hungarian crisis may be confirmed by Khrushchev's own statement: ""I don't know how many times about whether to get out of Hungary or 'crush the mutiny.'It is difficult to decide exactly to what extent Beijing influenced Moscow in making decisions, but as the above Chinese account shows, the Chinese did play some role in the process and the Russians did take China's attitude seriously. On 3 November 1956, three days after Russian tanks rumbled into Budapest, China's People's Daily was one of the earliest communist papers worldwide to hail the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian revolt. China further endorsed the political change in Hungary by sending Zhou Enlai, its premier, to the still-smoldering Budapest in mid-January 1957, where Zhou's residence had to be guarded by Soviet tanks. In the history of Chinese diplomacy, the Chinese influence in the Polish-Hungarian crisis was the first time China exerted its power in Europe, ""a development the Soviets would later regret,"" as Joseph L. Donaldson pointed outAlthough the details of the Chinese hard line on the Hungarian crisis were not known until the late 19905, China's public endorsement of the crushing of the Hungarian revolt-represented by the presence of the Chinese delegation in Moscow during the time, the prompt official statements, and Zhou Enlai's timely visit to Budapest-would be taken as a clue to China's stand in that crisis during next four decades. But China's stand on the Hungarian crisis, no matter how tough and impressive, showed only one side of China's policy and influence during the era of de-Stalinization or liberalization. China's criticism of Russian ""big-power chauvinism,"" its rejection of Russian interference in the Polish crisis, and Mao's suggestion that Russian troops withdraw from Poland and Hungary before the situation became worse suggest a more complicated Chinese stand. If we extend our vision to the entire era of de-Stalinization and reexamine some less noticed facts before and after the Polish-Hungarian crisis, we will certainly find a different China, whose liberal-oriented stand, judged from a strict Stalinist point of view and regardless of its intention, was echoed among the Eastern European reformists or anti-Stalinists as early as 1955 and lasted as late as the summer of 1957, more than half a year after the crushing of the Hungarian revolt. There was evidence showing that China began to attract attention from some Eastern European countries during the time when, shortly after Stalin's death, the Soviet leadership began to show a certain willingness to allow policy changes, named the ""New Course,"" initiated by Georgi Molenkov , the immediate successor of Stalin later replaced by Khrushchev. Domestically the New Course included modification of the Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry, accordingly paying more attention to agriculture and light industry by loosening control over the prices of food and clothing, and relaxation of political terror. Internationally, the New Course involved the rehabilitation of Yugoslavia's Tito-who had been expelled from the communist world by Stalin in 1948-by Khrushchev's sudden visit to Belgrade in May 1955. Compared with the storm brought about by the CPSU's Twentieth Congress later on, this New Course was like a breeze, but it did ""thaw"" the soil frozen during the rigid Stalinist regime. The Eastern European parties responded to Moscow-to some extent encouraged by the Kremlin-by introducing the same changes in economic, social, and party affairs. In order to obtain more autonomy from Moscow, some Eastern European countries turned to Beijing for inspiration under the pretext that China was in the stage of socialist transition similar to that of Eastern Europe, whereas the Soviet Union had entered a much higher stage of socialist construction. For example, in East Germany, which was the first one to take some New Course policies in Eastern Europe as early as 1953, the Twenty-fifth Plenum of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany passed a resolution adopting the Chinese method of nationalizing the remaining large private enterprises by offering 50 percent compensation to the former owners of the businessTo buy rather than confiscate means of production and allow the former owners to participate in management was a Maoist policy to smooth the transition that was quite different from the Soviet model of socialist nationalization. The East German interest in the more moderate Chinese method of nationalization continued to grow in 1956 and was reflected in articles and reports in newspapers and party magazines. Neu Zeit, a party organ, for example, reprinted an article on 13 June 1956 under the title ""Why We Capitalists Welcome Socialism,"" written by the chairman of the All-Chinese Industrial and Trade Society and originally published in People's China, a Chinese foreign propaganda organ, as a response to inquiries from owners of private enterprises in East Germany. In the September edition of the SED's theoretical periodical Einheit, a Chinese article titled ""New Stage in the Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Capitalist Trade in China"" was published. When Walter Ulbricht, the general secretary of the SED, reported to his party on his trip to Beijing for Eighth Congress of the CCP in September 1956, he emphasized the alliance of the Chinese Communists with the so-called ""national bourgeoisie. In Hungary, the Chinese influence was reflected in the ideology of emerging Hungarian nationalist communists, particularly in Imre Nagy's admiration of China's Five Principles of coexistence. Nagy, who was purged during Stalin's later years, rehabilitated during the New Course, and appointed as Hungarian premier from late 1953 to 1955, proposed his reformist line that included easing the tempo of industrialization, allowing peasants to leave collective farms, and relaxing police terror. For this he was ousted in March 1955 by Hungarian Stalinists led by Matyas Rakosi. In his forced retirement, however, Nagy sensed the coming political storm and wrote a lengthy thesis titled ""In Defense of the New Course"" in late 1955 and early 1956. The paper was later published as a book in the West under the title On Communism, in which four major issues were addressed: industry, agriculture, political terror, and foreign policy. In the foreign policy chapter, China's Five Principles of coexistence became the pillars for his theoretical framework defending Hungarian national sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union. The Five Principles of coexistence included mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistenceChina first proclaimed these principles in a communiqué with India in 1954. Then in 1955 at the Bandung Conference of Asian and African states, Zhou Enlai formally proposed them to all non-Western countries as the principles of international affairs as opposed to colonialism. The official Chinese statements referring to these principles often came with a restrictive phrase, ""between states of different social systems,"" which was made to allay the noncommunist Asian countries' fear about revolutions exported by China, but left unclear whether they could apply to ""states of the same social system."" The title of the foreign policy chapter in Nagy's paper was ""The Five Basic Principles of International Relations and the Question of Our Foreign Policy."" Not only were the Five Principles used as the overarching thesis in the chapter, but also it was announced that they ""must extend to the relations between the countries within the democratic and socialist camps.Nagy's paper was circulated among dissident Hungarian communists, and in the spring of 1956 Nagy delivered one copy of his paper to the party's central committee and another to Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov, the Russian ambassador in BudapestIt was a tragic irony that in less than one year Nagy's wishful thinking of the application of the Five Principles to the Hungarian-Russian relations and his illusion about China's sympathy for the Hungarians would evaporate when Beijing urged Moscow to intervene and the People's Daily was one the first communist papers to praise the suppression Fully aware of the attractions of its own policies and the tensions between Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, China observed the difficulties of Stalinist leaders in Eastern Europe with great interest and in some cases maintained active contacts with emerging reformists. For example, according to Janos Radvanyi, a high-ranking official in the Hungarian Foreign Ministry in charge of Asian affairs who had close ties with Hao Deqing, the Chinese ambassador in Budapest, the Chinese embassy established a very effective information network within the Hungarian Communist Party and government The embassy even gained the reputation of ""the best informed foreign post"" in the capital. Through this network, Hao learned Nagy was working on the paper, and when the paper was delivered to the party's central committee, Hao obtained a copy through a Hungarian friend serving in the secretariat at the party's headquarters. In contrast to the Soviet embassy's invitations to Hungarian Stakhanovists , Hao was more interested in entertaining leading Hungarian writers, artists, economists, and journalists-some of them were not regarded as trustworthy by the government-with fine Chinese food in the embassy. Hao also traveled widely in the country and obtained firsthand information about the changing atmosphere in the wake of Stalin's death from local cadres. China's cultural attaché, who spoke fluent Hungarian, also maintained close connections with Hungarian intellectuals, while the reporters of the Xinhua News Agency and Chinese exchange students reported to the embassy on the activities of the famous Petofi Circle, the center of dissidence. After the CPSU's Twentieth Congress, with the discrediting of Stalinist policies coming into air, China became more attractive in Eastern Europe, and China's activities promoting its influence became more aggressive. Marked by the publication of ""Let One Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let One Hundred Schools of Thought Contend,"" a policy report made by Lu Dingyi, the head of the propaganda department of the CCP, in May 1956 and published by People's Daily on 13 June, China initiated an intellectual liberalization aimed at releasing accumulated internal pressures in the short run, with a long-run purpose of allowing some flexibility and criticism within the regime in order to win popular support and detect mistakes. The Double-Hundred policy soon became a new focus of the Chinese attractiveness in Eastern Europe. In September the CCP's Eighth Congress opened, and all Eastern European communist parties sent delegations to Beijing. The event was used by Beijing at that critical moment to introduce its own road toward socialism and to build up relations with the post-Stalinist generation among Eastern European leaders. For example, Janos Kadar, the head of the Hungarian delegation, who was purged during Stalin's years but rehabilitated in 1954, was very popular in the Hungarian party for his anti-Stalinist stand. Chinese leaders were very interested in this emerging new leader, and Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai all had long conversations with him. On 1 October Kadar once again represented the Hungarian party at the celebration of China's National Day in Beijing One point that has not received adequate attention on the Double-Hundred policy is that the metaphoric expression created a false impression of tolerating various-if not all-ideological opinions, especially among those who were unfamiliar with the CCP's ideologically oppressive past, such as the Yenan Rectification in the 19405 and the Thought Reform Campaign in the early 19505. This was particularly the case when the Double-Hundred policy aroused widespread proChinese sympathy in Eastern Europe, where people were excited by the slogan itself but did not have adequate knowledge about the CCP's history and had no chance to scrutinize the specifie contents of the Chinese materials introducing the new policy. In Hungary the Chinese ambassador took the opportunity to enhance pro-Chinese sentiment by providing mote information to Hungarian intellectuals and students, and he even made a special effort to publicize the CCP's Eighth Congress, which opened in September and confirmed the Double-Hundred policy, by supplying abundant information to Hungarian press and radio. As a result, the CCP's Eighth Congress was given a great deal of publicity by Hungarian media, which further nourished the pro-Chinese sentiment. Many dissenting Hungarian intellectuals came to believe that the Double-Hundred policy truly reflected the intention of the Chinese communists. In the meantime, with Nagy's rehabilitation and reappointment as premier, China's Five Principles of coexistence were used against Soviet ""big-power chauvinism""-a term also coined by the Chinese. The Hungarian illusion of China lasted until the last minute, when Irodalmi Ujsag declared on 2 November that ""The West and the East are on our side. America has proclaimed her faith in our cause as clearly as have powerful nations like China and India. It is noteworthy that after the Hungarian revolt was put down, China's role in relaxation of control and tolerance of dissent became even more prominent among Eastern European reformists. In contrast to the general atmosphere in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the wake of the Hungarian incident, China continued its own liberal-oriented practice initiated in May 1956. The Double-Hundred policy was not interrupted, and in February 1957 Mao added to it by making the famous speech ""On the Correct Handling of Contradictions within People,"" which acknowledged the existence of contradictions in socialist society and thus legitimized a certain degree of discontent or even nonantagonistic opposition against specific policies of the government. In April the CCP intensified its efforts to solicit criticism by launching a ""rectification"" campaign, which continued until early summer, when the CCP waged a counterattack against critical intellectuals with the sweeping anti-Rightist campaign. The question when Mao decided to use the Double-Hundred and Rectification campaigns as baits to ""lure snakes out of their nests"" is yet an unanswered question, although some have suggested it could have been as early as anytime after the Hungarian crisisWhatever Mao's real intention was, for the Eastern European intellectuals who felt chilled to the bone while out in the cold following the Hungarian suppression, the Chinese persistence in liberalization was a beacon in the darkness and the only hope for them to retain the freedom they obtained after the CPSU's Twentieth Congress. The Maoist concepts of DoubleHundred and nonantagonistic contradictions within people were music to their ears, because they implied critique of labeling all criticism as ""bourgeois,"" ""capitalist,"" or ""imperialist"" and thus not only questioned the legitimacy of silencing all dissenting voices, but also attributed aggravation of domestic crises to government policies and foreign interference. They were not completely misreading the Chinese message. As a matter of fact, the Polish-Hungarian crisis was taken by the Chinese as a textbook example of problems caused by the suppression of dissenting voices, particularly in the first half of 1957, when they were fully confident about their own regime's popular support It was against this background that many Eastern European antiStalinists ""were much intended to see in Peking a mecca of revisionism"" In East Germany, the reformist communists, led by Karl Schirdewan , Paul Wandel , and Jürgen Kuczynski , among others, praised China for its exemplary work seeking harmony between party and people through distinguishing ""antagonistic"" contradictions from ""nonantagonistic"" contradictions and thus encouraging criticism. Schirdewan said China had understood how to use the CPSU's Twentieth Congress in a ""creative"" way. Wandel singled out China as the only socialist country where the priority of the party had been given to ""the indivisible relationship between party and masses."" Kuczynski openly advocated China's Double-Hundred policy: ""Let the flowers bloom: each in its own way-for all flowers adorn the world with their thousand-fold colors, scents, and shapes. That is the true progressive attitude toward scientists, writers, and artists.Their activities and speeches forced the conservative clique, represented by Ulbricht , to engage in months of discussion with them in 1957. One response Ulbricht made in February to the advocacy of the Double-Hundred policy was ""our main problem is not 'to tell all flowers to bloom' but rather to find the right selections of flowers, and to grow what is truly new and useful, without tolerating the growth of noxious weeds under the pretext that they are flowers. Gomulka, the party's first secretary, who tried to maintain a neutral stand between Stalinist and reformist lines, said that his party watched China ""with profound sympathy.He praised the CCP for its ""greatest boldness"" in contributing to ""the creative teachings of Marxism-Leninism"" by the introduction of ""new methods in solving nonantagonistic contradictions"" and ""the hundred blossoming flowers,"" which was ""so far unknown in the practice of socialist construction in other countries."" Gomulka's pro-Chinese remarks were made on 15 May, when he was addressing his party's ninth plenum. One week before, a Polish party journal published an article saying, ""The contradictions within the people-in spite of the specific difference between the countries-also appear in our country. To overcome them through persuasion and discussion requires a decided struggle against bureaucracy, an improvement of the state machinery and an elastic policy toward political and class allies."" The article also appealed for transplanting ""the Chinese flowers. Similar appeals for imitating China, transplanting China's ""flowers"" in particular, were heard in other Eastern European countries in the late spring of 1957, when the ""rectification"" campaign reached its peak in China. In response to this appeal, a Hungarian party magazine cautioned on 26 May: Of Chinese movements in recent months that which has spread in the field of literature, art and science, i.e., ""let every flower bloom,"" is the most widely spread in Hungary. In its first stage it was attacked for leading to the liberalization of intellectual life and the repression of Marxism. Comrade Mao Tse-tung, who is familiar with the Chinese intelligentsia and knows that its majority is loyal to socialism, defended the slogan of ""a hundred flowers"" . after the sad experience of the past it is perhaps just as well to guard ourselves against the idea of realizing Chinese methods in Hungary From the very beginning of China's tolerance of different ""flowers,"" Moscow watched with doubt, disapproval, and even anxiety, especially after the Hungarian revolt. According to Chinese sources recently made available, when the CCP decided to announce the Double-Hundred policy, they sent Lu Dingyi, who would be the first to speak of the policy, to inform Pavel Yudin, the Soviet ambassador in Beijing. The CCP did this in accordance with a customary practice that Moscow and Beijing should inform each other of important policy changes in advance-although Moscow failed to follow this practice in the case of Khrushchev's secret report, resulting in Beij ing's resentment. After Lu Dingyi explained the policy to Yudin, the Soviet ambassador responded by providing Lu with a copy of one of Lenin's articles relevant to the subject but against tolerance. On the way back from the embassy, Lu sighed to Yu Guangyuan, his secretary, ""So entrenched is their dogmatism!After the Polish-Hungarian crisis, the Chinese persistence in liberalization intensified Moscow's uneasiness. In April 1957 Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov, chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, visited China. According to Li Yueran, who was the Russian interpreter for the CCP's central committee from 1949 to 1964, Voroshilov expressed his concerns and worries about the Double-Hundred policy directly to Mao at least twice. Voroshilov said that he did not understand why all of those antisocialist, anti-communist party opinions had been allowed to be published in newspapers. He warned Mao of the danger of such a liberalization, citing the Hungarian revolt as example. Mao assured him that China was not Hungary and that Chinese communists did not want to be ""flowers and grasses in the greenhouse."" He was fully confident, he told Voroshilov, that if the hidden enemies wanted to take advantage of this tolerance to overthrow the CCP, they would only end up ""exposing themselves. The typical Soviet attitude toward the Chinese policies of liberalization, and toward the fanfare in Chinese newspapers about the Double-Hundred policies in particular, was reflected in Khrushchev's words. Khrushchev was deeply disturbed by the fact that the Chinese ""are good at coming up with catchy phrases"" and that they ""know how to introduce the right slogan at the right time.Recalling the confusions in the Soviet Union created by the Chinese slogan, he said: Our own propagandists asked me how we should respond. ""Our people are reading in the newspapers about this new campaign in China,"" they told me, ""This Hundred Flowers talk is already creeping into Soviet society."" We instructed our newspaper editors and propagandists to drop the subject of the Chinese campaign and not to touch it again. Our position was that the Hundred Flowers was a Chinese slogan for internal consumption only, and that it did not apply in the USSR. We avoided any direct criticism of the campaign but we also refrained from supporting it .... Any peasant knows that certain flowers ought to be cultivated but others should be cut down. Some plants bear fruit which is hitter to the taste or damaging to the health-while others grow uncontrollably and choke the roots of the crops around them Khrushchev had already been in trouble because of his de-Stalinization campaign, therefore he could not afford any more liberalization policies, although he understood that Mao ""wanted to goad people into expressing their innermost thoughts"" in order to catch those he considered ""harmful."" Khrushchev also rejected Mao's thesis concerning contradictions among people in socialist countries, which was also echoed sympathetically in Eastern Europe. On 2 June 1957, at the peak of the Chinese rectification campaign and on the eve of the anti-Rightist campaign, he was interviewed by the correspondent of America's CBS Television and Radio in Moscow. When he was asked about his attitude toward Beijing's recent statement that in socialist countries ""there can exist contradictions between the masses and the leader,"" Khrushchev gave the American correspondent a blunt answer: ""We believe that we have no contradictions of that matter. All of these episodes clearly indicate a strong Chinese influence on liberalization in Eastern Europe and even in the Soviet Union in 1957. Moscow's disapproval of and warning to China and its stopping the spread of such a liberalization in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union itself revealed two major concerns. The first was apparently the apprehension about the political stability in the newly pacified Soviet satellite states; the second was the Soviet vigilance against the Chinese challenge to Moscow's leading role in the communist bloc, given the fact that Moscow's position had been seriously weakened by deStalinization and the Polish-Hungarian crisis. Finally and ironically, China's influence was also reflected from the opposite direction. When Mao signaled the anti-Rightist campaign in early June 1957, the conservatives in Eastern Europe felt relieved. Some of them made quick responses and even similar actions. For example, in East Germany the correspondent of Neues Deutschland, the party's magazine, reported on 12 July from Beijing, ""The main thrust is aimed against the 'right.' . Now the advocates of the 'right' are being publicly exposed.A few months later, in the early 1958. Ulbricht launched a campaign against ""revisionists"" in his party with the purge of Karl Schirdewan , Fred Oelssner , Ernst Wollweber , and Paul Wandel . They had been sympathetic to China and had advocated application of Chinese policies, the Double-Hundred policy in particular. This East German campaign also inflicted punishment upon many intellectuals who misread messages from China and thus exposed themselves as did those Chinese Rightists who took the bait prepared by Mao. THE VIETNAMESE CASE Chinese influence in the Vietnamese case should be considered in a totally different light. If the Chinese influence in Eastern Europe came late and was limited compared with the Soviet influence in the area, then the close connection-promoted by traditional and cultural links between the two nations-between Chinese and Vietnamese communists was much deeper and can be traced back to the 19205. Many Vietnamese communists, Ho Chi Minh himself included, were once engaged in the Chinese communist movement and took refuge in China during the 19305 and early 19405. The triumph of the Chinese revolution in 1949 not only furnished cross-border support in the forms of advisory and material assistance to the Vietnamese revolution, but also provided a model for emulation. In March 1951, at the second Congress of the Vietnamese communist party, Mao's thought was to parallel Marxism and Leninism as the party's guidelines for the new constitution. Mao's picture was displayed along with the pictures of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin Within this historical context, Vietnamese developments in the era of de-Stalinization had more connections with China than with the USSR. Unlike Eastern European countries, whose most imminent problems at the time resulted from transplanting the Stalinist model, including overemphasis of heavy industry, lack of everyday necessities, grievances from previous purges, police terror, and, on top of that, political control from Moscow, North Vietnam's most acute problems resulted from their imitation of the Chinese model. Among the borrowed Chinese practices, three in particular were causing widespread discontent. The first was land reform, in which any better-off peasant could be labeled a ""landlord,"" sent to ""people's court,"" and publicly executed without any legal process, with sympathizers facing severe punishment. The second was thought reform, in which intellectuals-even those who had proved their commitment to the revolution by participating in it-were rounded up and sent to special schools or study sessions to be reeducated and forced to confess. The third was control over intellectuals by a military regime. This was because until February 1955, North Vietnam did not have a ministry of culture, and most intellectuals who participated in the Anti-French War-artists in particular-were enrolled in the communist army and were thus under the grip of the army's General Political Bureau, which was modeled after that of the Soviet Union and, more directly, China. Many political officers were trained in China and instructed the intellectuals' activities, public and private, through military discipline: they had to get a pass, for example, to leave the barracks where they lived, like soldiers. After Stalin's death, like elsewhere in communist world, the dissenting voice also began to be heard among North Vietnamese intellectuals as early as 1955. In February, about thirty writers and artists in the army drafted a resolution to the party's central committee ""demanding the abolition of the General Political Bureau's leadership over arts and letters in the army."" Accompanying this resolution was an ""Outline Policy for Arts and Letters,"" which included three demands: ) hand over the leadership of arts and letters to the artists and writers; 2) establish an arts and letters association within the structure of army organization; 3) abolish the existing military regime insofar as it affects the artists and writers serving in the armed forces.The leading figure of this dissenting group was Tran Dan, a poet popular for his lyrics for the Vietnamese national anthem. In the same month, Tran Dan led about twenty writers and artists to speak to General Nyuan Chi Thanh, the head of army's General Political Department. They proposed three requests, based on the above statement, centered on creative freedom for writers and artists. This political petition was declined by the general and he chided these army intellectuals, saying their action ""shows that capitalist ideology has begun to attack all of you comrades.The failure of this petition significantly frustrated the intellectuals, who naively believed that their contribution to the revolution had won the party's trust, and thus prepared the ground for the intellectuals' more radical challenge to the party the following year. In a broader vision, Tran Dan and his group constituted part of the Literary Thaw movement in the communist world in the mid-1950s, driven by writers and artists and targeted at the Stalinist doctrine of ""socialist realism"" and party control of intellectualsBut Tran Dan's case also suggests a Chinese connection. He was in China in 1954 when Hu Feng's affair took place. Hu, a literary critic and longtime member of the CCP, sent a lengthy letter to the party's central committee in July 1954 that criticized the domination of the party's literary authority figures, whose enforcement of socialist realism allowed no freedom for creative work and whose bossy attitude toward writers and intellectuals was even more annoying. Although he had no intention of challenging party authority, Hu's action reflected grievances of a wide range of intellectuals and artists and was taken as evidence of the earliest cleavage between the party and intellectuals after the formation of the PRC. In late 1954, however, the literary authority of the party launched a counterattack and forced Hu to make self-criticism, and by May 1955 the orchestrated ""Anti-Hu Feng's Counter-Revolutionary Clique"" campaign was in full swing. Hu was arrested in June 1955 and imprisoned until the end of the Cultural Revolution. There is no doubt that Tran Dan was exposed to the materials related to Hu Feng's letter: he was in China at the time the letter created a great deal of sensation and stimulated discussions among Chinese intellectuals. There is also no doubt that Tran Dan was sympathetic to Hu, because he himself was in conflict with the same type of literary authority figures Hu was attacking. Tran Dan was sent to China to finish the narrative for a film describing the victory in Dian Bien Phu . As a customary practice, he was accompanied by an army's political cadre with whom he later was in conflict because of the latter's excessive interference with his artistic work. Tran Dan also abhorred the same dogmatic application of ""socialist realism"" Hu was criticizing. At the same time he was initiating discussion with General Nyuan Chi Thanh, Tran Dan published articles that vehemently criticized Viet Bac, a collection of poems praising socialist life and communist heroes written by Tu Huu. Tu Huu was a member of the party's central committee, in charge of literary and intellectual activities, and his book was expected to set an example of socialist realism by portraying model heroes, although it could not be measured by any aesthetic values. When attacking ""socialist realism"" of Tu Huu's type, Tran Dan asserted, ""Realism encourages a hundred schools to thrive both in substance and in form."" This led Boudarel to suggest that ""as early as February 1955, a Let-a-Hundred-Flowers-Bloom campaign was brewing in the cultural department of the North Vietnamese armed force. It was over a year before the movement to bear such a name really started in China, and nearly two years before it was put into effect.However, the phrase ""a hundred schools"" actually derives from ancient Chinese history, referring to the intellectually and philosophically contentious atmosphere during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period . Given the fact of Chinese cultural influence in Vietnam, it would not be groundless to assume that Tran Dan used the phrase but was unaware of its origin. Furthermore, the first time the phrase ""let a hundred flowers bloom"" entered China's cultural life was in 1951, when Mao was asked by Mei Lanfang, the most well-known actor of traditional opera, to issue a directive for the newly created Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera. Mao's directive was ""Let a hundred flowers bloom and let the new genres replace the old.As for the phrase ""let one hundred schools contend,"" it was Mao's response to a debate between Guo Moruo and Fan Wenlan, two prominent historians, regarding how to apply Marxist theory to divide Chinese ancient history. It was in this context that Mao was asked by Chen Boda, his secretary and the director of the Research Committee of Chinese History to give a directiveTherefore, both ""hundred flowers"" and ""hundred schools"" had been used in China since 1953 for theatrical and academic work, although they were proposed separately, spread within certain circles, and were not endowed with profound political meaning until spring 1956 in the context of de-Stalinization. Vietnamese intellectuals' discontent with the regime did not begin with Tran Dan's conflict with the party but rather could be traced back to the late 19408, according to Kim N. NinhTherefore the Chinese connection in Tran Dan's case may be considered an inspiration that encouraged him to air his built-up grievances. Tran Dan's friends later acknowledged the connection between Hu Feng and Tran Dan in a cartoon published in Nhan Van, the most influential Vietnamese dissident magazine, in its issue of 30 September . The party was even more aware of the connection, and it should not be a surprise that when Tran Dan was purged and arrested in February 1956-six months after Hu Feng was imprisoned-the rationale for some cadres involved in the arrest was ""China has Hu Feng, perhaps we also have a Hu Feng.As Ninh pointed out, ""Apparently the fierce campaign against Hu Feng in China had heightened the sense of vigilance in Vietnam"" and consequently Tran Dan became the victim of such vigilance Shortly after Tran Dan was arrested, however, the international circumstances turned favorable to the intellectuals. The CPSU held its Twentieth Congress in February and the CCP announced its Double-Hundred policy in May, both of which had immediate impact upon the relationship between Vietnamese intellectuals and the party. In order to introduce the new Soviet line, Anastas Mikoyan, the Soviet first deputy premier, went to Beijing and Hanoi in April. In the same month Tran Dan was released from prison, ostensibly because his arrest was made without the authorization of the top leadership of the party, but the change in international atmosphere certainly played a role in his release as well. Lu Dingyi's speech of late May advocating the Double-Hundred policy quickly found zealous readers among Vietnamese intellectuals. Tran Due Thao, the famous philosopher and dean of the faculty of history at the national university , quickly found someone to translate it in July According to Bernard B. Fall, North Vietnam at first tried paying no heed to the sudden liberalization in China, but ""the 'hundred flowers' could not be ignored very long"" because the Chinese slogan was embraced by many of the best writers who remained in the north. For them, the Chinese slogan echoed the ideas left with them by the French liberal education they received many years beforeTwo important meetings in the summer became rallying points of dissent. One was the Hanoi Municipal Congress from the end of July to early August, where attendees were extremely critical of many policies of the party, from food shortages to taxation. The other was a conference of North Vietnam's Association of Art and"
334bd019-e235-457f-bb52-2ac9c8822fd3,"OTTAWA - Canada sees itself as a ""counterbalance"" to Russia's negative influence on emerging democracies in eastern Europe, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay said Wednesday as he wrapped up a two-day visit to Ukraine. ""There are outside pressures , from Russia most notably,"" said MacKay in an interview from Kyiv. ""We want to make sure they feel the support that is there for them in the international community. Canada has a distinct and legitimate role to play in promoting what we feel is a very successful and functioning democracy in our own country."" MacKay expressed concern over the Kremlin's announcement last week that it intends to pull out of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. It is the latest in a series of irritants that continue to chill relations between Moscow and the West, raising fears of a renewed Cold War. ""There have been some troubling - in fact very disturbing - comments made by the Russian leadership and, to that extent, I think Canada can play the role of positive influence and counterbalance,"" MacKay said. NATO is concerned about Russia's decision to pull out of the treaty and wants to convene a conference to discuss Moscow's concerns. The 1990 treaty was designed to solidify peace between Russia and its traditional Cold War enemies by limiting the number of tanks, artillery and combat aircraft that Russia and Europe can deploy in their border areas. The Interfax News Agency quoted a senior Russian defence ministry official as saying he doesn't ""see any big reason to have such a conference."" MacKay also alluded to other problems that have emerged in Russia's toughening foreign policy towards the West in recent years, including its decisions to cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus, and meddling in the affairs of Georgia, which the Kremlin still considers to be within its sphere of influence. Russia views the U.S. decision to deploy a ballistic missile defence system in eastern Europe as provocative, a charge that Washington has dismissed as unfounded. Washington, meanwhile, has accused President Vladimir Putin of using energy as a weapon to stifle democratic development in countries that were once part of the Soviet Union or its power bloc. MacKay lauded Ukraine for the steps it has taken towards democracy since its December 2004 ""Orange Revolution"" as he announced a $16 million package to support further democratic reform. The new money includes $6million for judicial and social services for youth, and $9million for improvements to public administration, judicial policy and gender equality. ""We don't want to see any slippage or any negative influence happening. Quite the opposite, there are neighbouring countries that we're concerned about as well, including Georgia and Belarus,"" said MacKay. Less costly but higher in profile will be the $400,000 that Canada will spend to send 60 observers to Ukraine's September parliamentary elections, under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Former prime minister John Turner led a similar delegation of monitors in December 2004. MacKay said that with 1million Canadians of Ukrainian descent, Canada has a responsibility to help the country fulfil its democratic dreams. ""We can punch above our weight in a number of areas in the world,"" MacKay said. ""But here on the democratic front, I think Canada is highly respected and looked to because of the large diaspora.""

114b405d-71ed-4226-804f-8cfed5d344b8,"Naval diplomacy-the use of naval power in peacetime to secure influenceby contemporary navies is seen by many as playing a vital and unique role in promoting the international aims of governmentsThe U.S. Navy's Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, clearly recognizes the diplomatic utility of naval power: ""Navies are not only critical, decisive, and enabling in times of war, but they may be even more important in maintaining the peace.Naval diplomacy includes what Sir James Cable calls ""gunboat diplomacy,"" which is ""the use of threat of limited naval force, otherwise than as an act of war, in order to secure advantage or to avert loss, either in the furtherance of an international dispute or else against foreign nationals within the territory or the jurisdiction of their own state. Naval diplomacy allows states to signal national interests in a particular region, and through naval presence, navies can also act as subtle reminders of their states' military might and commitmentNaval diplomacy can support allies, influence neutrals, deter potential enemies, protect interests, and uphold international lawAmerican naval diplomacy and foreign policy goals were clearly linked in the 1994 strategic concept paper Forward . from the Sea: ""Naval forces are an indispensable and exceptional instrument of American foreign policy. From conducting routine ship visits to nations and regions that are of special interest, to sustaining larger demonstrations of support to long standing regional security interests. US naval forces underscore US diplomatic initiatives overseas.Naval diplomacy, then, is a way in which the United States can use its naval power to achieve desired effects and advance foreign policy goals. Or so, at least, it is widely assumed. Using American naval diplomacy in the Black Sea during the summer of 2006 as a case study, this article questions the generally accepted view of the diplomatic utility of naval power. It argues that naval diplomacy can be counterproductive: that it can not only fail to produce desired political effects but cause unintended and unforeseen damage. In the Black Sea, the fallout of naval presence may ultimately damage American interests. This article, focusing on the preparations for a joint U.S.-Ukrainian multinational exercise, will illustrate how diplomatic goals of American naval diplomacy were thwarted by Ukrainian domestic politics and how naval presence itself exacerbated already poor relations between Russia and Ukraine. EXERCISE SEA BREEZE American foreign policy objectives in the Black Sea are to secure the region from terrorists and other security threats, promote democracy and stability, and ensure the free flow of goods and energy in this closed seaThe establishment of U.S. military bases in Bulgaria and Romania signals the American geostrategic stakeIn theory, naval presence operates along a spectrum of influence, by means of, variously, coercion , ""picture building"" , and coalition buildingLacking declared adversaries in the Black Sea, U.S. naval presence here has no intended coercive role-though, as will be seen, that is perceived differently in Russia. The United States does, however, face a number of security challenges in this region: illegal migration, human trafficking, and drugs and weapon smuggling, as well as ""a potential front in the global war against terrorism.In addition, the Black Sea has become a vital route for energy and goods It is in this broad context that U.S. naval presence in the Black Sea pursues the third fundamental task, coalition building-""a range of activity expressly intended to secure foreign policy objectives not by threatening potential adversaries but by influencing the behavior of allies and potentially friendly by-standers""-through sending messages, reducing risk of conflict, offering reassurance, improving interoperability, and allowing states to act jointly against common threatsAn important vehicle for coalition building in the Black Sea has been, since 1997, SEA BREEZE, a joint and combined maritime and land exercise with the principal goal of enhancing the interoperability and maritime capabilities of Black Sea states. In the summer of 2006, SEA BREEZE was to be hosted by Ukraine and the United States and conducted off the Crimea with seventeen participating statesThe American embassy in Ukraine stated in a press release that the exercise was ""designed to improve cooperation and coordination between countries in the Black Sea Region.An additional aim was to support the Ukrainian government, engaged in the complex task of building democracy after the Orange Revolution of 2004. The United States was among the first states to reject the fraudulent presidential elections in Ukraine in November 2004, and since then it has actively encouraged state building at all levels, including militaryFor its part, Ukraine sees multinational exercises like SEA BREEZE as aiding its own foreign policy objective of NATO membership, demonstrating progress in military modernization, and increasing interoperability with NATO forces. The United States began preparations for SEA BREEZE 2006 by hosting an Initial Planning Conference at the Ukrainian Naval Institute in Sevastopol in October 2005The objectives were to establish each participating nation's training needs, a plan of action and milestones, manpower and equipment requirements, cost estimates and funding availability, host-nation capabilities and logistical needs, and a command and control structure, as well as to draft exercise scenariosSuch preliminaries are vital, but it appears that neither U.S. European Command , directly responsible for the exercise, nor the U.S. embassy in Kiev thought through the likely effect of the upcoming Ukrainian parliamentary elections on the exercise or American coalition building. THE EFFECT OF U.S. NAVAL DIPLOMACY ON UKRAINE The relationship between naval diplomacy and domestic political factors is complex. It has been argued that success is in the eyes of the ""locals,"" that the psychological environment of a ""target"" state affects its decision makers and ""internal opinion forming groups.Naval diplomacy, then, must take account of a state's political, historical, economic, and military worldview;19 domestic politics-the policy environment, the decision-making arena, and internal pressures-shape the parameters and likelihood of what can be achievedThe routine planning and routine preparation for SEA BREEZE 2006, which were to be caught up in a messy political crisis in Ukraine, became a case in point. On 26 March 2006 Ukraine held parliamentary elections to decide the composition and priorities of its government. After the Orange Revolution a constitutional package of reform had been agreed upon whereby Ukraine would move toward a parliamentary, as opposed to a presidential, system of government after the March elections. The new prime minister, who would form a cabinet to run the government, would no longer be appointed by the president but instead be drawn from the political party with the most seats in the Ukrainian parliament, the Rada, and would have significantly increased powers. The recently elected president, Viktor Yushchenko, however, would continue to direct Ukraine's foreign policy and in addition would appoint three members to the new cabinet-for the interior, foreign, and defense ministries. In the parliamentary election the Party of Regions, associated with Viktor Yanukovych, Yushchenko's discredited rival in the October 2004 presidential elections, won the most seats. With more than 32 percent of the popular vote Yanukovych's party took 186 out of the 450 Rada seats. He was closely followed by the party of Yulia Tymoshenko , which won more than 22 percent of the popular vote and 129 seats. In a sign of growing discontent with the pace and shape of the Orange Revolution, President Yushchenko's own party, Our Ukraine, received a mere 14 percent of the vote and eighty-one Rada seats. Finally, the Socialist party, which would later prove crucial, won thirty-three seats. No party, then, had won a clear majority in the Rada. The new prime minister found himself unable to form a new government, creating a stalemate. Yushchenko held exhaustive talks with his former ally Tymoshenko about joining their respective parties to form the next government. Personal animosity and mistrust as well as differences over priorities ultimately thwarted the attempt, producing a political stalemate that threatened the sustainability of democracy in Ukraine when it became clear that rather than accept Viktor Yanukovych as the next prime minister, the president was seriously considering dissolving parliament and calling for fresh elections. It was during this political impasse-when the absence of either a working government or parliament made impossible the constitutionally required parliamentary authorization of foreign troops on Ukrainian soil-that, on 27 May 2006, the U.S.-flag merchant ship Advantage arrived at Feodosiya with five hundred tons of construction material and equipment for use in that year's SEA BREEZE exercise. The cargo was for a temporary multinational training base to be built at Starry Krym in the Crimea. U.S. Marine reservists and Navy personnel were also deployed to help the Ukrainian navy assemble hangar-type canteens and utility rooms Inevitably, SEA BREEZE 2006 became a hostage to the political crisis in Kiev over the formation of a new coalition governmentWithin two weeks the ship would be forced out of port, its equipment and cargo impounded by Ukrainian customs, and the reservists forced to fly home, their mission unachieved. Absent parliamentary approval of the exercise, the legality and constitutionality of preparations for it were soon questioned. This political ambiguity and postelection infighting created an ideal opportunity for the opposition party to criticize the government. The Party of Regions called the unloading of Advantage in Feodosiya an example of ""brutal contempt"" by the government for the constitution. Amid similar media allegations, the foreign and defense ministers , as well as the prosecutor general, were forced to declare on their own authority these preparations permissible under Ukrainian lawThe foreign minister, Borys Tarasyuk, stated that no Ukrainian law had been breached, as Advantage was ""a civil ship and consequently . subject to international trade law. If the preparations for the exercise were permissible under the constitution, formal authorization would still be needed from the Rada. The foreign minister agreed that the exercise could only begin after parliament had given its approval. On 4 August 2006 the Rada finally met and authorized the landing of foreign troops on Ukrainian territory for the purpose of multinational exercises. But it was too late-SEA BREEZE had been scheduled to begin two weeks before: the political atmosphere had been poisoned, Yushchenko's bargaining position in the formation of the postelection government had been weakened, and discontent over Ukraine's foreign policy orientation had been brought to the surface. The declared foreign policy goals of President Yushchenko were full European Union and NATO membership, closer relations with the United States, and, at the same time, a strategic partnership with Russia. His government had, however, been heavily criticized for failure to inform the public of, and gain its support for, the plans to join NATOSurveys in Ukraine have shown that the majority of the Ukrainian people are opposed to NATO membership, especially in the eastern part of the country and in the Crimea, where the Russian Black Sea Fleet is based. The government's attempt in this context to secure parliamentary approval for the off-loading of Advantage became a lightning rod for a widespread campaign against the government's proposed foreign policy in general. Residents of Feodosiya blockaded the city's port, protesting what they saw as an attempt by NATO to establish a presence in the Black Sea. Displaying placards with anti-NATO slogans, pickets prevented the American reservists from preparing for the exercise, ultimately forcing them to abandon the attempt. Within two days of the arrival of Advantage the Ukrainian defense minister was forced to deny media reports that its landing party was to build a NATO base near FeodosiyaNonetheless, the public perception of SEA BREEZE as a NATO rather than a multilateral, U.S.-sponsored operation took hold; the day after the arrival of Advantage the Feodosiya town council declared the town a ""NATO-free area"";27 a week later the Crimean parliament declared the peninsula a ""NATO-free territory. The acrimonious debate about NATO membership soon spread to the feuding political parties in Kiev. Public discontent in the Crimea was exploited fully by opposition parties in the capital to embarrass the government and to force concessions on NATO membership. Yevhen Kushnaryov, Rada member from the Party of Regions, told a public protest at the Feodosiya seaport that Ukraine was ""faced with attempts to bring NATO into Ukraine by force. Allegations in the press that Yushchenko's government reacted too slowly to the public protests now damaged the president. It took Yushchenko almost a week to sign measures to deal with the crisis and decree preparations for the exercise. Only on 3 June did he confirm the exercise, call upon local councils to abide by Ukrainian law, and direct local governments to take urgent measures to maintain public orderThe authorities in Kiev were also censured for failure to provide sufficient information or counter misinformation about the planned exercisePresident Yushchenko blamed a lack of military coordination and failure of the defense ministry to settle all the details of the exercise with local authorities and international parties The Party of Regions called for a referendum on NATO membership; Viktor Yanukovych-finally seated as prime minister on 4 August on the basis of a coalition with the Socialist Party-signaled that membership was unlikely to take place for two or three yearsIn fact, the accord between the Party of Regions and the Socialists spoke of ""advancing"" toward, rather than joining, NATOIn 2005 President Yushchenko and his team had worked tirelessly to fulfill the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan and had committed themselves to signing a NATO Membership Action Plan by the end of 2006. Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet have radically altered that policy. During a visit to Brussels in September 2006, Prime Minister Yanukovych stated that Ukraine was not yet ready to implement a formal plan for NATO membership; instead, Ukraine would focus on deepening its partnership with the alliance CASTING A SHADOW: THE EFFECT ON NEIGHBORS The strategic importance to Moscow of the Black Sea should not be underestimated. Russia has more than twenty-five thousand personnel and almost two hundred ships in the Black Sea. President Vladimir Putin declared that the ""Azov-Black Sea basin is in Russia's zone of strategic interests""; the Black Sea, he explained, ""provides Russia with direct access to the most important global transport routes, including economic ones.Russia's interest in the Black Sea can also be explained by the historical importance of the Crimea, in particular the port of Sevastopol, to its national identity. The Crimea is intrinsically connected to the Russian nation's foundational myths, some of them propagated by the Soviet Union and then taken up by the Russian Federation. Uneasy at the American presence in the Black Sea, the Russian Federation refused to take part in the first SEA BREEZE, in 1997. A foreign ministry spokesman stated that it would send only observers: ""Russia still does not agree with the idea of holding the exercises and has no plans to participate in them.More recently, poor relations between Russia and the United States in general, as well as NATO and U.S. attempts to secure interests in the Black Sea, have increased Russian sensitivity to American naval presence in the region. Attempts by Russia to build a strategic partnership after the 9/11 attacks failed, and U.S. support of the democratic revolutions in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan strained relations. By May 2006 Vice President Richard Cheney was accusing Russia of backpedaling on democracy and using its oil and gas to blackmail neighbors The idea of pursuing an integrated Western strategy toward the Black Sea region has in fact steadily gained ground since the NATO Istanbul Summit of July 2004. The enlargement of the alliance to include Bulgaria and Romania raised the issue of how it was to protect security and stability in the Black Sea. Responding to this prospect, the Russian defense minister, Sergey Ivanov, at a meeting with his Turkish counterpart challenged expansion of NATO naval patrols to the Black Sea; regional security, he declared, ""should be ensured by the forces of the Black Sea states.Subsequent American efforts to initiate alliance counterterrorism patrols have been blocked by active Russian participation in the Black Sea Force-established in 2001 by the six littoral states for search and rescue, humanitarian assistance, mine clearance, environmental protection, and goodwill visits. In July 2006 the Russian navy, represented by a large assault ship, took part in the sixth iteration of a Black Sea Force exercise series, with Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, and Ukraine Russia has also been an avid supporter of Black Sea Harmony, a Turkish initiative to set up a naval force to combat terrorism in the region. In September 2006, under that rubric, Russian ships conducted a joint mission with the Turkish navyThis patrol was specifically meant to ""demonstrate Russian naval presence in the Black Sea navigation areas.It was to be, said Sergey Ivanov, the Russian defense minister, Russia and Turkey, the two Black Sea countries possessing modern navies, that ""are responsible for security in the Black Sea area.Black Sea Harmony is accordingly viewed by many as an attempt to prevent NATO from extending its successful multinational ACTIVE ENDEAVOUR series from the Mediterranean into the Black Sea If this exercise in naval diplomacy was casting a shadow over Ukraine's neighbors, it was also exacerbating already difficult relations between Ukraine and those neighbors. Relations between Russia and Ukraine had been particularly strained. Even a deputy in the Russian Duma , Vladimir Ryzhkov, acknowledged that meddling by President Putin in the Ukrainian 2004 presidential election had alienated millions of UkrainiansAlso, in early 2006 the Russian Gas Company, Gazprom, announced that it had cut off supplies of gas to Ukraine. Only under pressure from Europe could Russia and Ukraine work out a compromiseThe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the Russian government of economic pressure and blackmail Feelings were still raw when the arrival of Advantage produced public protests. The Duma, aided by the Russian media, saw an opportunity to criticize Ukraine's NATO orientation directly. The Ukrainian defense minister, in turn, alleged that the protests showed that certain Russian forces were meddling in Ukraine's internal affairsThe Ukrainian security Council too believed that foreigners, particularly Russians, were participating in the demonstrations in the Crimea. The Russian media were also accused of whipping up public feeling about NATO;49 for instance, Ukraine's law enforcement agencies found themselves forced to deny Russian media reports that Ukrainian special forces had been sent to Feodosiya to deal with the anti-NATO protests The chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations, Andrey Kokoshin, cautioned against what he saw as attempts by politicians in Ukraine to drag the country into NATOThe Duma itself went even farther, resolving that Ukraine's accession to NATO would ""lead to very negative consequences for relations between our fraternal peoples.The Ukrainian foreign ministry replied that the ""edifying tone of the commentaries in the context of cooperation of Ukraine with NATO used by the Russia side exceeds the limits of common international communication standards.It asserted that as a sovereign democratic state Ukraine had an inherent right to make its own decisions about security and which security structures it would join LESSONS TO BE LEARNED Plainly, navies need to prepare for and conduct presence operations more effectively than was done in this case study if they are to achieve desired diplomatic effects. The first lesson to emerge from this case study has already been recognized by Admiral Michael Mullen, Chief of Naval Operations of the U.S. Navy-the need to improve cultural awareness within the service. Admiral Mullen envisions that American sailors ""will be expected to understand and foster cooperation in cultures far different than our own.Military personnel engaged in planning for and participating in future coalition-building exercises will clearly need to understand the culture, history, and sensitivities of host states as well as of their neighbors. In Ukraine, plans for future exercises will need to consider the complex and rapidly changing political environment in the former Soviet Union as well as Ukraine's difficult relations with its larger neighbor-the Russian Federation. The second lesson is the danger inherent in the ""routinization"" of naval diplomacy. The mechanics of deploying assets into a theater to prepare for naval diplomacy tend to become standardized, but the political contexts in which exercises take place are inherently dynamic, if not volatile. Consideration needs to be given to the political contexts in which even smaller, more routine recurring exercises are conducted. Third, some agency must be made responsible for developing and implementing a vigorous information campaign to support an exercise. During the crisis over the arrival of Advantage, both U.S. European Command and the American embassy in Kiev produced detailed press briefings in an attempt to contradict media misinformation and address general lack of public understanding of SEA BREEZE. However, this effort was too little and too late to challenge the campaign of opportunists to damage the Ukrainian government and its foreign policyTo be effective-that is, to ensure that the correct message is being sent and being understood-naval diplomacy must be supported by an extensive and well thought out information campaign within the recipient state, a program that targets the media, security stakeholders, the public, political factions, and interest groups. Fourth, the United States would do well to encourage states with which it engages in coalition-building exercises to undertake public-awareness campaigns detailing the domestic advantages of participation. In the absence of a Ukrainian public information campaign about SEA BREEZE, the public was easily confused by suggestions in the local and Russian media that the operation was actually an attempt to build a permanent NATO base in the Crimea. During 2006 European Command held workshops with Russian leaders aimed at fostering military relations and planning bilateral training events for 2007These meetings suggest that there is already recognition within the United States of the last, fifth, lesson-the need to reach out to neighboring states that might be affected by littoral operations. Problems with SEA BREEZE 2006 suggest that such outreach is a vital element of any successful naval presence operation, certainly in the Black Sea-to overcome and mitigate the ""shadow"" effect. One such meeting was held in May 2006, before SEA BREEZE. Rear Admiral Dick Gallagher, director of European Command's European Plans and Operations Center, commented that during four years of high-level meetings with the Russian Federation military he had come to recognize the desire on both sides to ""not only communicate but to actively understand each other."

Gela Bezhuashvili demanded that Russia explain the formula it used to arrive at the new price. At a meeting with Georgian diplomats and foreign media that lasted for more than two hours, Bezhuashvili spoke about the tension in Georgian-Russian relations. He accused Moscow of creating problems in the conflict zones and noted once again that Georgia urged Russia to have a goodneighbourly attitude towards Georgia. Russia cannot reconcile itself with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia must change its attitude towards its neighbours. It is unacceptable for one to impose economic sanctions and a total blockade against Georgia in order to achieve one's political goals and try to make Georgia change its political course. Why is it that one country, a neighbouring country, has a lower price, while another one has a high price? Moreover, where is the formula for this? Is there a clear and transparent formula for changing the price of gas? If there is such a transparent formula, I think it would be interesting for you as well to see what the price of gas for Europe is based on.

47b118b9-d512-4319-bffc-547b388cb141,"Iran and Russia have concluded a revised schedule for Russia to fuel a light-water nuclear power reactor that a Russian contractor is constructing near the Iranian city of Bushehr. According to Sergey Shmatko, head of the Russian contractor for the project, the two countries signed an agreement Sept. 26 providing that Russia would deliver the low-enriched uranium fuel for the reactor by March 2007, RIA Novosti reported. The reactor is to begin operating in September 2007 and begin providing energy two months later. In February 2005, the two countries concluded an agreement to supply fuel for the reactor for a period of 10 years. At that time, Alexander Rumyantsev, then-director of the Russian Federal Agency for Atomic Energy, said the reactor would begin operating in late 2006, with the fuel to be delivered about six months earlier. However, the project has since been delayed. Although Russian officials have characterized the delays as resulting from technical issues, officials from other countries have said that foot-dragging also has likely played a role. Iranian officials for their part have expressed frustration with the pace of the reactor construction. According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Vice President Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who also heads Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, told reporters Sept. 25 that the delays were caused by technical issues as well as incompetence on the part of the Russian contractor. The project has encountered repeated delays since Russia agreed in 1995 to finish the reactor. The original German contractor abandoned the project following Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. The September agreement came as Russia and five other countries were attempting to persuade Iran to resume negotiations designed to resolve international concerns about its gas centrifuge-based uranium-enrichment program, which the United States believes to be part of a nuclear weapons program. Tehran contends that the program is meant to produce fuel for other future nuclear reactors. Subsequently, Tehran's failure to meet an October deadline for resuming negotiations prompted the UN security Council to take up discussions again on a resolution that would take punitive actions against Iran . The resolution could affect the fuel-delivery schedule, but Russian officials have repeatedly said that Moscow intends to move ahead with the reactor. For example, the current head of Russia's atomic energy ministry, Sergei Kiriyenko, indicated during an early September interview with Reuters that the project was not linked to the other Iranian nuclear issues. ""As long as the plant does not violate nonproliferation requirements. .there will be no obstacles,"" he said. Additionally, Russian Security Council Secretary Igor Ivanov said that Moscow ""will fulfill all its obligations"" with respect to the project, RIA Novosti reported Oct. Nevertheless, U.S. and European officials have told Arms Control Today that they believe Moscow is pressuring Tehran by slowing work on the project. Press reports have indicated that work has slowed, but Russia has not explicitly linked the project's pace to Iran's compliance with UN demands. The United States had previously urged Russia to end work on the project. But U.S. officials said in 2002 that Washington would drop its public objections if Moscow took steps, such as requiring Iran to return the spent fuel to Russia, to mitigate the project's proliferation risks. The 2005 deal includes such a provision, designed to reduce the risk that Iran will separate plutonium from the spent fuel. Separated plutonium can be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons. Tehran does not have a known facility for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to obtain plutonium, although it has conducted related experiments. Russia also contends that the reactor will not pose a proliferation risk because it will operate under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Agency safeguards agreements require states-parties to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to allow the agency to monitor their declared civilian nuclear activities to ensure that they are not diverted to military use. - PAUL KERR Sidebar Iranian Vice President Gholamreza Aghazadeh meets with Sergei Kiriyenko, head of Russia's atomic energy ministry, Sept."

2f1ec714-defc-434d-ab85-a08d8e79c090,"Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua MOSCOW, DEC. 11 - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has now spent more than seven months in the Kremlin, as has his predecessor, current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, in his new seat in the ""White Palace"" government compound by the Moscow River. Both of them, who some say represent the double-headed eagle on the national emblem, continue to pursue the proactive and pragmatic foreign policy initiated during Putin's presidency and strive to regain the country's once-strong global influence. Close Allies With Consistent Policy When the then President Putin announced his clear support last December for Medvedev, his close ally and first deputy prime minister, in the March presidential election, he nearly ensured his protege's victory. Medvedev subsequently offered the premiership to Putin, a former schoolmate who had promoted him from a law professor in St Petersburg to the top job in the Kremlin, while pledging to continue Putin's set policies, saying that they also incorporated his own ideas and contribution. In his first foreign policy guideline issued in July, Medvedev vowed to continue along the path set by Putin and safeguard Russia's interests in the world, amid a deteriorating relationship with the United States and the European Union. In particular, Medvedev's Foreign Policy Concept inherited Putin's hawkish tone to slam a missile shield plan launched by the United States, which proposed the deployment of missile interceptors in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic. The exchange of accusations over the anti-ballistic missile shield plan may have driven Moscow-Washington ties into a downturn, but the Concept also voiced Russia's willingness to cooperate with the United States. ""It is necessary to switch over Russian-US relations to the state of strategic partnership, to overstep barriers of strategic principles of the past,"" said the Concept, which is not far from Putin's early appeals. However, a month later, a five-day conflict between Russia and US-backed Georgia dashed prospects of a fast patching up of the deteriorating relations between the two nations. Teeth Bared On Pro-Nato Georgia On Aug. 8, Georgian troops launched a sudden attack against the country's breakaway region of South Ossetia to reclaim control over the Caucasus region. Russia sent in troops the next day, defeating the Georgians. The military conflict ended on Aug. 12 with a France-brokered ceasefire pact under which Moscow promised to withdraw its troops. A follow-up agreement set a timetable for the withdrawal of Russian troops and for the deployment of foreign observer missions. Georgia, a former Soviet republic now seeking NATO membership along with Ukraine, has long accused Moscow of supporting its breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a narrow belt neighbouring Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi. Moscow then recognized the self-proclaimed independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on Aug. Observers say the five-day conflict was Russia's first military fightback against the far-reaching hands of the United States and the US-led NATO's eastward expansion, which Moscow considers a threat to its national security. ""Backyard Strategy"" To Warn US In addition to counter measures against the US missile shield plan such as resuming patrolling of key areas of the world's oceans and test-firing intercontinental missiles, Russia also dispatched navy convoys to the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea this year as further steps. Russian naval ships held exercises in the northern Atlantic in January in the country's first large-scale Atlantic drill in 15 years. The war games involved aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, two destroyers and two supply ships. In September, two Russian Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at a military airfield in Venezuela to carry out a number of training flights over nearby waters. During Medvedev's week-long tour of Latin America in late November, a Russian navy convoy, including a nuclear cruiser, an anti-submarine destructor, a tank vessel and a tugboat, held joint manoeuvres with their Venezuelan counterparts. Russia also inked an array of oil and arms sale contracts with Venezuela, Cuba and Libya in a bid to strengthen mutual ties in the economic and military sectors. ""Russia has already returned to Latin America, including Cuba,"" Medvedev said while summing up his first visit to Latin American countries, which included stops in Peru, Brazil, Venezuela and Cuba. However, despite Russia's show of military might, analysts express doubts over the likelihood of an all-around confrontation between Moscow and Washington. They believe the two sides could tap the potential for cooperation in some other areas to preserve world stability. This view has been borne out by Russia's suggestion of enhanced cooperation with the United States in fields such as space exploration, nuclear non-proliferation and arms control. Netting Support, Influence Via Int'l Agencies Amid rows with the West, Russia has repeatedly called for multilateral cooperation and reform of international institutions to ensure global security. The Foreign Policy Concept echoed such an idea by slamming unilateralism and advocating multilateral cooperation, noting the United Nations should play a key role in adjusting international relations and coordinating policies. In recent years, Moscow has actively engaged itself in the Group of Eight industrialized countries, the Commonwealth of Independent States , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other international and regional organizations. Against the backdrop of the ongoing global financial crisis, Russia participated in the Group of 20 summit in Washington in November to seek solutions and pledged to enhance cooperation with other countries to tackle the crisis. Meanwhile, Russia has taken an active part in major international and regional affairs such as the Korean Peninsula and Iranian nuclear issues, the Middle East peace process and also made efforts to boost ties with African countries. 21, Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, passed a bill extending the presidential term from four years to six, 16 days after Medvedev put forth the initiative. Analysts say the approval is a clear signal that the country's mainstream political forces are eager to see an extension of the presidential term and the continuity of policies.

e6dd0380-f4f5-4ba4-b771-a876e49efeab,"Russia has had a consistent policy of promoting a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, opposing resolution of the nuclear issue through pressure or sanction, supporting a multilateral process and solution, promoting adherence to Non-Proliferation Treaty rules, and expanding mutually beneficial economic cooperation. Moscow first suggested initiating a six-party process regarding a solution to the divided Korean peninsula in 1994. North Korea is generally positive about Russia's suggestions. The United States has belatedly and reluctantly recognized Russia's positive role in the process. Russia hopes the Six Party Talks will gradually evolve into a multiparty security and cooperation system including a peaceful DPRK. This will be facilitated by international economic assistance to the DPRK and institutionalization of the 6PT. Successful Russia-U.S. cooperation may have much wider implications. Key words: Russian foreign policy in Korea, North Korea, multilateral security - East Asia, nuclear weapons Early Russian Efforts to Promote Collective Security in Korea On March 24, 1994 the Russian foreign ministry made public a suggestion for a six-party conference involving the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia, and Japan. The United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency were also supposed to join the discussion on Korea for finding a compromise solution to the ""first"" North Korean nuclear crisis. That crisis began in March 1993 when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea , suspected of nuclear-weapon development, left the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty The proposed comprehensive solution in Korea was meant to include: * promoting nuclear nonproliferation in Korea; * guarantees of noninterference in the internal affairs of the two Korean states; * military confidence-building measures; * replacement of the 1953 Korean armistice agreement with a new peace treaty; and * normalization of bilateral relations between certain members of the talks The idea itself was not new. After the end of the Korean War the armistice agreement of 1953 recommended that the governments of the countries concerned hold a conference to solve the problem of withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and reach a peace agreement. The idea of a six-party ""consultative conference"" raised during the 43rd session of the UN General Assembly was first proposed by South Korea and was supported by Japan Russia's support for the process was based on the presumption that the Korean security issue was rooted in the long history of relations between the four powers on the Korean issue. Historically, imperial Japan was the colonial master of Korea and only its defeat in World War II by the United States and the USSR brought about Korean independence. The United States and the USSR agreed on the division of Korea at Yalta in 1945. Soon after, however, they became adversaries in the course of the Korean War, which also involved China. The cold-war confrontation was the product of the global competition between two systems: the USSR and China, both of which, although at odds with each other, had alliance treaties with the DPRK and supported Pyongyang, versus the U.S.-Japan-South Korea bloc. This system provided the security balance on the peninsula. Thus, the 1994 Russian suggestion was not spontaneous and was prompted by Russia's attempt to protect its national interests. However, at that time it was ignored. As Samuel Kim puts it: ""Being left out of the Chinese bilateral approach and marginalized by US hegemonic sanctions, Russia was attempting to get back into the game. Washington dismissed the Russian proposal as a harmful distraction while Beijing scuttled it as deviating from its declared party line.Instead, a 2+2 formula formula was implemented, in 1996, rebuffing Russian attempts to be involved. This format was introduced without consultations with Moscow. In fact, Russian diplomats learned about it almost by chance from South Koreans. The U.S. verdict at that time was that ""the major powers have not found Russia a useful partner in responding to the dangers confronting them .That became a painful reminder to Russia that despite its good intentions for collective efforts aimed at achieving collective security in Asia, its interests were not taken into account. The episode weakened the positions of ""pro-Westerners"" in the Russian Asia-related foreign-policy establishment and the calls for a ""balanced"" policy . ""Standing on two feet"" in the Korean peninsula gained force Russia nevertheless adhered to the idea of a multiparty settlement. After 1994 Moscow consistently promoted the idea of six-party negotiations for a Korean settlement as a part of its Asian strategy. The Russian side argued that it was logical to consider the interests of all the parties and to ensure the legitimacy of the agreements reached. However, as the Russian role is traditionally viewed in the West with suspicion, based on longterm geopolitical prejudices, these ideas met with a lukewarm response throughout the 1990s. During this U.S.-North Korean bilateral relations determined the situation on the peninsula. At the same time the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral consultation mechanism permitted the latter two countries to influence decision making. Meanwhile, China used its leverage to influence North Korea to some degree, and this reality pushed the United States to consider China an important dialogue partner on the Korean issue. Russian Diplomacy in the Second Nuclear Crisis The four-party process soon broke down, which was not totally unexpected by Russian experts. Nevertheless after the second nuclear crisis broke out in 2002, the United States made a point of trying to lure its allies and opponents alike into a coordinated framework and ""reinvented"" the idea of a multilateral settlement. Some Russian experts believed the chief goal was to build a partnership with China to influence it and to ""encircle"" North Korea by applying pressure from all participants in the talks. If that was the case, Russia with its ideology of a multipolar world was obviously not a welcome member. It supported China strategically and opposed pressure tactics against Pyongyang. Despite Russia's contribution to the philosophy of an eventual multilateral settlement and its well-known position, the other participants did not include RussiaMoscow openly expressed its desire to be a part of this process but was rebuffed under the pretext that North Korea did not mention the need for its participation. Actually, the North Koreans wanted a bilateral dialogue with the United States, but this was opposed by Russia When, however, North Korea finally agreed to the idea of multilateral talks, its approach changed. It was Kim Jong Il who insisted on Russia's participation in the talks when the United States brought up the issue of giving Japan a seat at the table. Obviously, Pyongyang wanted a more balanced composition of the members of the talks and also wanted to exploit rivalries among them. ""It is a struggle to break the country's excessive dependence on China,"" former ROK Unification Minister Park Jae-gyu pointed out Regarding the Russian contribution to the vision of the talks' mission and their philosophy, it should be remembered that in December 2002, only weeks after the crisis erupted and the DPRK restarted its nuclear program and withdrew from the NPT, the Russian foreign ministry officially suggested a ""package solution."" 10 After fruitless years of a tug of war between Pyongyang and Washington, the modalities of negotiations and the compromise in 2006-2007 followed almost precisely the Russian proposals made at the end of 2002. A New Russian Proposal The main elements of the Russian-suggested ""package"" of January 2003 included about a dozen synchronized steps, starting with mutual simultaneous declarations on the DPRK's possible return to a nuclear freeze and U.S. readiness to resume the supply of heavy oil. The proposal also called for bilateral consultations aimed at agreeing on the current status of the Agreed Framework of October 1994 and what to do with it. At a more advanced stage, it was suggested that the United States and the DPRK make a list of their concerns with and demands from each other and exchange them. At this stage, the ""co-sponsors"" would jointly analyze these lists and exchange views as to what was realistic and what was not and advise the two parties accordingly. With their help the DPRK and the United States could determine what to start with and what to leave for the future. Of course, the minimum minimore was the DPRK's return to the NPT, its denouncement of weapons of mass destruction , and firm U.S. guarantees of noninfringement on DPRK sovereignty and security. Co-sponsors would have acted as guarantors of strict fulfillment of these obligations by both parties, because neither Washington nor Pyongyang seemed to put much trust in the UN or international law. In the future, the DPRK and the United States could proceed to full normalization and an end to hostilitiesRussia's proposal not only envisaged a multilateral diplomatic process but also called for a much more active role for the four partner parties besides the United States and the DPRK in the political settlement than actually transpired. Thus, Russia's eventual inclusion in the six-party format in June 2003 was the result of a consistent Russian policy based on long-term concepts of a Korean settlement and an Asia-Pacific security paradigm. The concept of a multilateral peace settlement in Northeast Asia is generally based on the conviction that all members of the six-party mechanism have overlapping sets of common goals: for North Korea, security and aid not excluding eventual denuclearization ; for the others, denuclearization, not excluding-at least publicly-security and aid for North Korea. Russia at the Six Party Talks The Russian Position Basically, the Russian position on the DPRK nuclear issue and the Six Party Talks can be summarized as follows. * The DPRK's acquisition of nuclear weapons deals a severe blow to the nuclear nonproliferation regime, which can have dangerous consequences for Russian security both in the Far East and quite distant areasShortly before the DPRK nuclear test, Russia's military chief of staff, General Yuri Baluyevsky, stressed that ""it is necessary to do everything possible in order not to allow North Korea to conduct tests; it is necessary to do everything for the resumption of the six-party talks on this problem. It is necessary to do everything in order that the Korean peninsula never becomes an arena of the use of nuclear weapons.Russia believes the Korean peninsula should be free from all nuclear weapons. * Russia is strongly against any attempts to solve the nuclear issue through pressure or sanctions and would use its influence to prevent external interference or attempts for a regime change. Russia stresses that the five parties and international bodies must guarantee North Korean security and stop threatening the DPRK. Relations between North Korea and other countries should be finally normalized. * Moscow suggests that the eventual solution to the Korean issue should be found within the multiparty diplomatic process and the ideas of a ""package solution"" should become the basis for itMilitary tension should be decreased, and confidence-building measures should be implemented. A new permanent peace regime should be established on the peninsula that guarantees equal security for all the countries. * Russia stresses that the DPRK should obey the NPT rules, and verification and guarantees of denuclearization should be based on international law. At the same time, as all countries have the right to develop modern energy technologies, including nuclear energy, Russia would support development of a peaceful nuclear program in the DPRK, including possible construction of light water reactors As the chief of the Russian nuclear energy agency stated in November 2005, Russia does not exclude its participation in LWR construction as a part of a multinational consortium16 if the DPRK would return to the NPT. Reactions to the Russian Proposal North Korea approved of these Russian suggestions and used them for working out its own position for the Six Party Talks. Russian officials later pointed out that ""at the three-party talks in April 2003 in Beijing, North Koreans handed over to the United States a ""package plan"" that contained many elements of ours .Russia kept on promoting its suggestions for a ""package solution,"" pointing out that its elements ""coincide with suggestions of the other participants in the Six Party Talks.The North Koreans expressed their appreciation of the Russian approach. In a rare interview in 2006, then North Korean foreign minister Paek Nam Sun publicly praised the Russian position ""for the settlement of the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula at the negotiation table in a peaceful way"" and added, ""we value the Russian efforts.Of course Moscow and Pyongyang are divided on the problem of nuclear weapons in Korea, but recognizing the DPRK's lawful concerns gives Russia leverage to positively influence Pyongyang's position. However, in the United States, Russian policy in Korea was and is viewed with suspicion even during the Clinton-Yeltsin period in the early 1990s when Russia was supposedly a ""junior partner"" of the United States in international affairs. With the advent of the Republican administration in Washington in 2001, the attitude changed for the worst. Although the diplomatic consultations continued throughout the George W. Bush presidency, it sometimes looked like their participants literally spoke different languages. The United States and its Western allies mocked President Vladimir Putin after he announced during his first G-8 summit in Japan in July 2000, having flown there from Pyongyang, that Kim Jong Il was ready to forego development of missiles provided he could get access to launching services. U.S. diplomats later seriously discussed such an option with the North Koreans. U.S. officials in the first George W. Bush administration considered Russian policy toward the Korean issue ""unhappy,"" stemming from Russia's ""great power aspirations."" The Americans constantly wanted to change it. For example, in October 2003 Bush urged Putin to act sternly with North Korea, ""as with a capricious child that throws food on the floor.Predictably, Moscow was against such policies in principle. So this demand was seen as an attempt to further isolate Pyongyang by spoiling its relations with Russia. The United States also suspected that Moscow was keeping it in the dark concerning its dealings with Pyongyang Russia is still often seen in the United States as merely supporting China on the main issues in Korean affairs, and not playing an independent roleAt crucial moments in the UN , while Russia's stance was seen as opposing the United States,23 the U.S. side complained that the ""Russian problem"" was merely as a reflection of the ""Chinese one."" More recently, Russia was reproached for ""inactivity"" in responding to the initiatives of Lee Myung-bak's administration and was said to be doing little to help North Korea overcome its isolationWashington was not happy with Russian statements that North Korea and the United States shared the fault for the stalling of the Six Party Talks in 2008In a fantastic scenario drawn up by some commentator, Russia is even considered capable of a Machiavellian design to arm North Korea with the purpose of selling more arms to South Korea and helping eventual production of nuclear weapons in South Korea after a U.S. withdrawal. 26 Some conservative U.S. experts consider that ""Russia increasingly plays a self-serving spoiler role more related to a resurgent Russian resistance to the US globally than to anything relevant to Korea. The spread of such opinions is regrettable since Russia's stance on nuclear nonproliferation on the Korean peninsula is in fact close to that of the United States. Russia supports U.S. efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the problem of Korean security. Russia does not maintain a unilaterally pro-Pyongyang position, as Western commentators sometimes argueRussian politicians and high-ranking diplomats are on record repeatedly saying that North Korean nuclear programs ""threaten our interests,"" as when they strongly protested against the 2006 DPRK nuclear testOn many occasions Russia has confirmed support for the Six Party Talks and vowed to continue cooperation for denuclearization. 30 A South Korean report has provided an appropriate assessment of Russian policy: Russia has pursued fairly non-controversial policy objectives toward the Korean Peninsula: nuclear non-proliferation and the maintenance of peace and stability on the peninsula; support for inter-Korean dialogues and interactions contributing to a peaceful re-unification; expansion of mutually beneficial economic cooperation; and trying to obtain greater Korean involvement in developing Siberia and the Russian Far East. Moscow has attempted to enhance its role as a serious ""broker"" with North Korea Officially, Washington admits that U.S.-Russian cooperation on the North Korea nuclear problem is one of the important examples of foreign-policy coordination between the two countries. 32 U.S. officials point out that the solution to the Korean problem is probably ""the place we could work with Russia, as we have trouble working in other areas. Russian officials also see Russian-U.S. cooperation on Korean affairs as a possible model of foreign-policy coordination. Basing their opinion on 2007-2008 policy consultations, they are generally satisfied with the U.S. government's approach. This approach, they argue, is based on recognition of the Russian ability to positively influence the denuclearization process and does not lead to infringement of Russian interests Toward a Korea Settlement During the years that have elapsed since the start of the Six Party Talks, Russia has invested considerable effort in promoting the negotiations and preventing their collapse. Although the fate of the talks depends mainly on progress in U.S.-North Korea bilateral discussions , other countries' positions can be either constructive or destructive. Russian positions are moderate: There are no unsolvable contradictions between the positions of the parties . Russia strives for denuclearization under peaceful conditions and always tries to be constructive. Moscow also keeps on promoting this line in its contacts with relevant countries. The Joint Statement issued by President Dmitri Medvedev and President Lee Myung-bak on September 29, 2008 in Moscow stated: ""Russia consistently stands for provision of the non-nuclear status of the peninsula, for progress in the framework of ongoing six-party talks. We consider it necessary to continue this policy line, as well as the line for implementation in general of political, economic and humanitarian contacts between North and South in the spirit of agreements reached between these two states in the framework of summit meetings of 2000 and 2007. However, contradictions with the West abound concerning a Korean settlement and the corresponding multilateral process. Moscow is particularly wary of Western participants' tactics to force new concessions from Pyongyang without adequate reciprocity, endangering the whole denuclearization process. Russian officials have consistently been critical of the Americans' ""hardline stance.At the same time Moscow is unhappy with the U.S. view of the Russian role as that of only an ""interested observer.Russia wants to be an equal partner in finding a solution to the decades-old international problem bearing direct relevance to its interests. More trust and cooperation is obviously needed for that. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted in September 2008: Differently from some other members of the Six-Party Talks, we are acting in a team spirit fashion, collectively, as was agreed initially. We try to avoid unilateral steps. The purpose is denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, not solving bilateral problems of some participants. It would be fruitful if all the members of the Six-Party Talks would fulfill their obligations by the letter of agreements reached and not file some other requests without consulting other partners. And of course it would be important that all the DPRK partners in the six-party process would actually participate in providing economic assistance to Pyongyang. That, I think, would constitute a package that would enable the forward movement. Russia's ambition is to play a broker or moderator's role, acting in synchronization with others. This was illustrated by its role in solving the crisis in the implementation of the February 13, 2007 agreements because of the freezing by the United States of the assets of the DPRK in Banco Delta Asia in Macao. Moscow consistently urged the United States, even publicly, to ""make some steps toward the North Koreans"" and find an amicable solutionWhen the United States finally agreed to unfreeze the North Korean accounts and transfer the money to the North Koreans, Russia became indispensable because of the inability of all the countries concerned to implement this compromise decision. Banks simply refused to deal with the DPRK for fear of future negative consequences for them. The money was eventually transferred to North Koreans through a Russian commercial bank Despite disagreement within its leadership, Russia was the only member of the Six Party Talks besides the United States that actually supplied heavy fuel oil to North Korea as was agreed in February 2007. It continued carrying out this unattractive obligation even when the talks came to the brink of collapse in autumn 2008. Moscow would be unhappy should the negotiation process break down. It has denounced North Korea's attempts to question the viability of the talks. However, Russian officials indirectly blame the United States for dragging its feet on fulfilling its obligations and complicating the peace processDuring Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan's visit to Moscow in September 2008, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted: ""We generally share the approaches and opinion that there should be measures to prevent breaks . We should leave behind the current phase and get back to implementation by all the countries of the agreements reached based on the principle of action for action. However, Russian policy makers and the expert community alike fear that the six-party process might still get bogged because of insurmountable contradictions between the principle adversaries, the United States and the DPRK. In 2008, Russia was worried that the issue of North Korea's nuclear declaration and its nuclear cooperation with Syria might keep Washington from ""delisting"" the DPRK as a supporter of terrorism and removing trade sanctions, thus hampering progress in implementing the agreements. When finally North Koreans presented a more or less suitable declaration, U.S. conservatives prevented the actual delisting of the DPRK by insisting on a verification process so strict as to be acceptable only to a country defeated in a warThe North Koreans predictably responded with a ""super-hardline policy."" They kicked out IAEA inspectors and reversed the dismantlement of the Yongbyon reactor in an obvious attempt to influence U.S. policy circles and public opinion in the midst of the presidential campaign. The Future of the Six Party Talks An Action Agenda In the future, should the talks continue under a new U.S. administration, the issue of a light water reactor could resurface. Pyongyang has made it clear that it sees an independent national electricity production capacity as essential; but it cannot be achieved without a nuclear-powered generation facilityRussian experts have reminded the United States that North Korea expects it to create a proliferation-safe LWR instead of the reactor being demolished. Further down the road other issues-North Korea's missiles, other WMD, and the humanitarian situation in the DPRK -are likely to be put on the agenda, and the DPRK will demand comprehensive and irreversible guarantees for its system and elite as well as access to financial resources and development aid. The real root of the controversy, as Russian experts interpret it, is the fact that no ""strategic decision"" has yet been taken in either capital about the future. The United States still has not demonstrated its long-term commitment to toleration of the Pyongyang regime and coexistence with it without overt or covert attempts to bring it down. Consequently, North Korea has nothing left but to depend on its ""military deterrent"" and try to keep the country isolated in order to conserve the system and prevent its collapse. Russian experts try to see the reality as it is and not set misleading goals and deadlines. A serious policy cannot be based on wishful thinking and misapprehension. It is hard to imagine how North Korea could discard its only trump card-the nuclear weapons it now has-in return for mere promises, although it is prepared to move forward cautiously with terminating and dismantling its military nuclear production program. At the same time it is necessary to be fully aware that North Korea's renouncing of nuclear weapons will take a much longer time, and even then may only happen if it is satisfied with comprehensive security guarantees that have yet to be provided How do Russian experts see the possible future of the Six Party Talks? There is still no agreed concept of what should be their outcome. This should be worked out collectively. The change of U.S. administrations provides a chance for setting a goal, which should be realistic and then would enjoy Russian support. * The chief strategic goal of the diplomatic process should definitely not be just denuclearization, but peace, development, and friendly cooperation in Northeast Asia. The issue of North Korea's security is sometimes omitted and that blocks any progress. Therefore it is necessary to solve the WMD and other related issues in a manner that would not jeopardize the main priorities-peacefully and step-by-step. In fact, solving the main task is the key to solving the WMD-related concerns. * A peaceful scenario would presume turning the DPRK into a peaceful, non-aggressive, developing state, open to international cooperation-in short, the ""conventionalization"" of the country. That might seem utopian with the current regime, but it is under- going an evolution that could be successful provided the regime has sufficient guarantee of its security, including guarantees for the safety of the current elite. Therefore, the transformation should be gradual and not endanger political stability. An eventual power succession in the DPRK would present an ideal chance for starting such a process. * International assistance is a must for overcoming the backwardness and isolation of the DPRK, which is necessary for comprehensive security. The long history of aid to developing countries suggests that aid can be futile, even counterproductive, in the absence of complementary reformsTherefore, economic assistance to the DPRK as part of the package for the solution of the nuclear problem should be aimed at assisting system transformation, not at preservation of its outdated model. * The six-party format can be an ideal venue for coordination of such assistance. Its long-term aim should be the DPRK's economic and social transformation, by drawing it into the international division of labor and introducing international managerial experience, including a gradual transformation of the current political elite to become a more liberal government system. * For coordination of economic and development assistance, the interested countries could choose to create a special body entrusted with the task of planning and providing such assistance. The experience of KEDO proves that this task is feasible. * In the longer run the solution to Korean security and development issues could provide momentum for forming a regional structure by institutionalizing the Six Party Talks. The Desirability of a Multilateral Security System Russia would like to see a multiparty security and cooperation system emerge in Northeast Asia. The Six Party Talks have provided a unique opportunity to try a multilateral approach to solving the thorny issues that plague the region. In a best-possible future, we might paradoxically be thankful for the appearance of the North Korean nuclear problem simply because it actually triggered the emergence of regional security and cooperation dialogue. It took years to recognize the fact that a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem cannot be found without assuring the security of North Korea itself. The latter goal in turn cannot be achieved without the adoption of broader principles of interaction between the countries involved. That in turn leads to the conclusion that many ""narrow"" regional problems cannot be solved without first solving general issues of security and cooperation in Northeast Asia. This is especially critical in light of a nascent standoff between China, on the one hand, and the United States and Japan, on the other, a confrontation both sides would like to avoid in principle. Russia, having been drawn into a tense relationship with the United States globally in the wake of the war in Georgia, would also like to see Northeast Asia become a region of cooperation. There is no obvious geopolitical reason for confrontation there. Russia has always been a proponent of a multilateral security mechanism in Asia and the PacificInitiatives on multilateral Asian security organizations date back at least to the Gorbachev eraRussian positions in Asia have considerably weakened since the demise of the USSR, while the centrifugal tendencies of the Far Eastern regions have been on the rise. Therefore, Moscow has become even more interested in promoting its interests through a multilateral structure, which would provide access to the decision-making processes of other governments and prevent unilateralism. Theoretically speaking, institutionalization of the Northeast Asian security and cooperation mechanism might play an important role in a changeover from contentions based on mutual deterrence to a system of cooperation and competition grounded in the balance of interests, i.e., in a ""concert of powers."" The Six Party Talks may play an important role in working out a ""code of conduct"" in Northeast Asia and setting up a multilateral mechanism to promote it. As chair of the Working Group on the peace and security mechanism in Northeast Asia , Russia has suggested guiding principles for peace and security that the parties should find agreeableThe official position is that these principles should be adopted at the level of foreign ministers and thus set the framework for future work. This opinion is shared by the United States, which hopes to move forward on developing a Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism that ""would help transform the cooperative relationships built through the Six-Party Process into an enduring security framework for Northeast Asia.Russia also enjoys Chinese and ROK support in this activity However, controversies among the Asian members of the club could prevent them from setting up a charter of Northeast Asian security and cooperation. At the same time North Korea sees the multilateral format mostly as a nuisance-merely decoration for its bilateral dealings with the United States. North Korean diplomats consider the OSCE model irrelevant to Northeast Asia, pointing to this organization's failure to resolve the crisis in YugoslaviaThe stalemate in U.S.-North Korea dialogue as well as the pause in North-South Korea relations makes the DPRK's cooperation with the ROK on security issues unlikely and the degree of eagerness and initiative of the two Koreas in promoting multilateralism questionable at best. There is thus a niche for a relatively neutral Russian mediator role. Active diplomacy in this direction is especially important for Russia in the context of its global relations with the ""centers of power."" As Russia is increasingly seen as an opponent if not a foe of the West , it would be natural to think its cooperation with the United States on global issues would be limited at best. However, this logic should not necessarily apply in the Korean case, which might well be considered a special one in Russia-U.S. international dealings. U.S.-Russia cooperation in the framework of the 6PT might have much wider global implications At the same time, Moscow conservatives still fear that a fullfledged OSCE-type structure might only increase the U.S. hold on the region without producing tangible benefits for Russia or for other regional actors. They argue that Washington only pursues its own interests and is trying to strengthen its foothold in the area. Under this logic a new security architecture might harness not only its allies but also China and Russia in a framework where the United States, not being a geographical part of the region, would have rights but not obligations. The concept of what the agenda of the multilateral forum could be and the sequence of stages for establishing such a structure is being discussed in the Russian expert community. Some argue that Northeast Asia is not yet ready for a security mechanism and the road to it should start with a multilateral cooperation structure. ""In a multilateral process,"" writes one Russian researcher, ""structural and procedural issues are often no less important for the effectiveness of the process than substantive issues.The multiparty diplomatic process should therefore become a multi-track one, where progress in one direction should not necessarily depend on the situation in other tracks. A Japanese expert's approach-to link the bilateral, minilateral, and multilateral issues and institutions under the six-party umbrella framework-also seems soundSuch an approach can be used to address region-specific proliferation issues, security guarantees, economic assistance, and diplomatic relations, including changing the Korean armistice regime to a new peace regime and achieving coordination of institutions. Some suggestions for promoting the Northeast Asian cooperation organization building follow. * The security architecture should be discussed at an early stage, although the implementation of an agreed concept might take time. The general principles discussed between the parties are well-established in international practice and include obeying the UN Charter principles, forging mutual trust, noninterference in internal affairs, a decline in military danger, and diplomatic conflict resolution. Nevertheless, these principles will still not be formally agreed upon pending resolution of the nuclear issue. Discussion aimed at working out common approaches to forming a collective comprehensive security system should therefore be encouraged. The Chinese idea of integrative security presented at the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1996-combining comprehensive, cooperative, and common security concepts56-could become a basis for these discussions. * On a more practical level the sides should begin designing trustbuilding measures for the prevention of maritime and air incidents, notifications of military exercises and their monitoring by observers, and annual reviews of defense doctrines. Ensuring the security of maritime communication lines in Northeast Asia and to the south may also be relevant. * Countermeasures to nonconventional threats and challenges should be elaborated, including assistance during natural calamities, as well as fighting epidemics, environmental problems, cross-border crime, drug trafficking, and illegal migration. These issues are discussed at various fora, including ARF, but sometimes the area covered seems to be too broad for any concrete decisions and measures * Multilateral economic projects and coordination of regional economic policies should be discussed, particularly laying out common approaches to the setting up of new zones for free trade and reforming existing ones. Russia is especially interested in establishing regional integration in energy and transport infrastructure, in which it would be a core key participant * The setting up of an infrastructure for inter-civilizational and inter-ethnic contacts and rapprochement in the region where longstanding ethnic strife exists might become a historic mission of the new regional organization. It is important to develop joint projects in culture, science, and education, and stimulate multilateral humanitarian exchanges with due account of experience gained at bilateral negotiations. Regardless of the twists and turns on the thorny road of Korean settlement, promoting multilateral security cooperation will remain Russia's priority. The reasons are not only military and security in nature but also economic. In this era of uncertainty of world finance, the development of the real estate sector is fast becoming a priority, and this means an increased need for Russia's greater involvement in Northeast Asian regional energy and industrial projects."
77468803-089b-4a05-8012-493601c973bb,"Text of report in English by Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website on 19 August Tbilisi, 19 August: On 19 August 2008 the Permanent Council of the OSCE adopted a decision to increase the number of military monitoring officers in the OSCE Mission to Georgia by up to one hundred. The OSCE member states have decided that 20 MMOs will be deployed immediately in the areas adjacent to South Ossetia. As regards to the rest of the additional MMOs, the modalities for their deployment are to be proposed by the OSCE chairmanship, Finland without delay. By deployment of additional OSCE military monitoring officers in Georgia, the international mechanism is starting to operate, as stipulated by the cease-fire accord signed by the Georgian and Russian sides under the mediation of the president of France. According to paragraph 5 of the accord, ""while awaiting an international mechanism, the Russian forces will implement additional security measures"" in the conflict zone. Furthermore, the deployment of the OSCE military monitoring officers in Georgia implies that the Russian Federation, first of all, must withdraw unconditionally and without delay all its military forces from Georgia, and in parallel to this, immediately stop implementing aforementioned ""additional security measures"" carried out by the so-called peacekeepers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia would like to underline the active input and leading role of the OSCE chairman-in-office, without whom it would have been impossible to reach consensus on such a decision. The Georgian side demand that the Russian Federation comply with its obligations in good faith and abstain from impeding further decisions essential for meeting all obligations under the cease-fire accord.

The news agency Interfax-Ukraine on 19 August quoted him as telling a news conference in Kiev: ""Russia's actions affect the interests of Georgia's GUAM partners. This is absolutely unacceptable and so I, as secretary-general of this organization, demand that the international community find ways to influence Russia so that it should return to international law, civilized relations with its neighbours, and not only that."" He said it was not only Georgia that was attacked. ""The entire international community suffered because of this,"" he said. Chechelashvili also accused Russia of causing the collapse of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the private television channel ICTV reported later the same day. ""Russia has ruined the CIS. I cannot understand how one can speak about regional cooperation, multilateral regional cooperation and regional projects with a fist in one's pocket and a brick behind one's back,"" he was shown saying. He also predicted that Russia's military offensive against Georgia would have other political and economic consequences. ""Russia has restored the G7. Russia has shut the door to the WTO before itself. And, perhaps the most important thing, is that Russia has demonstrated it can no longer be a mediator and guarantor of the peaceful settlement of conflicts,"" he added.

Sales in the chemicals and petrochemicals industries in January-May totalled UAH15bn, including UAH11bn of chemicals and UAH4bn of rubber and plastics products. In the first five months of the year, output totalled 113,400 tonnes. In May, monthly plastic production was 23,200 tonnes, which was 1,300 tonnes up on April, but still below Februarys level and well down on typical output levels. Over the January-May period, overall chemical and petrochemical production was down 35% y-o-y, although the rate of decline was easing. The figures are not surprising given that Ukraine is one of the countries worst hit by the global economic crisis. BMI is forecasting a contraction in GDP of 14%, with key petrochemicals-consuming industries the worst hit. At the same time, the outlook for petrochemicals exports is bleak with the Russian, Turkish and EU markets also set to see sharp declines in demand. With the kind of economic growth rates seen in 2000-2007 unlikely to be repeated, the petrochemicals industry will be more heavily reliant on export markets. The depreciation of the hryvnia may provide some slight relief in terms of competitiveness, but equally it raises the cost of feedstock that has to either be passed on to the consumer or absorbed by a financially precarious petrochemicals industry. If the demand does not exist, then depreciation is unlikely to make a significant difference. Russian economic growth is not likely to be remarkable over the forecast period and the market is at risk of over-capacity owing to additional planned capacity due to come online. Consequently, Ukrainian producers will be more reliant on the eurozone for sales. The petrochemicals industry is set to receive a temporary domestic boost from increased construction activity ahead of Ukraines hosting of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. A diversification in markets and feedstock sourcing to remove the industrys dependence on domestic and Russian demand would enhance prospects. In 2010, we expect petrochemicals output growth of 6%, rising to 8% per annum in 2011-2013, in line with the pro-cyclical nature of the industry. This means it could take up to four or five years to recover from the losses in H208 and 2009. Any level of uncertainty concerning feedstock will have negative consequences for the petrochemicals sector, with a shortage of feedstock for its cracker units. BMI believes that gas price hikes will lead to a downturn in ethylene output, with exports projected to decline to zero over the forecast period. Ethylene output will be in the range of 525,000-535,000 tonnes per annum over the next five years. Cuts in ethylene output will increase dependency on PE imports, with the domestic industry without readily available feedstock. Ukraine is also set to become more dependent on PP imports. An improvement in the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Executive Summary Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 business environment and greater certainty over gas imports and prices would alleviate some of the problems facing the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. At present, the deteriorating domestic political environment makes it unlikely that Ukraine will see an expansion in production capacity over the next two to three years. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Ukraine Petrochemicals Industry SWOT Strengths Strong refining segment made up of six oil refineries with a combined capacity of over 1mn barrels per day The industry has attracted foreign investment and the backing of major Russian oil and gas entities Lukoil and TNK-BP Weaknesses Ukraine is a net oil and gas importer, and is likely to become increasingly reliant on imports which also look increasingly unreliable in light of the major Russia-Ukraine gas dispute in early 2009 The nation has suffered from a shortage of raw materials and an outdated asset base where investment has been severely neglected Opportunities Investments by KarpatNaftoKhim could significantly increase petrochemicals capacity, but their completion remains threatened by the economic downturn Threats Bureaucratic environment could offer considerable resistance to the privatisation and consolidation of the industry Further gas disputes with Russia could threaten survival of the petrochemicals industry Ukraine Political SWOT Strengths Despite a limited tradition of autonomy, Ukraine has withstood considerable pressure in the years after 1991 - internally from its Ukrainian-Russian ethnic divide, and externally from Russia - and preserved its independence The lack of reports of ballot box stuffing during the 2007 parliamentary election and the absence of any major legal appeals against the official election results is an encouraging sign of democratic progess in Ukraine Weaknesses Ukraine has little experience of party-based politics, leading to difficulties in forming coherent and stable parliamentary majorities, and weak government policymaking capability Much of the post-independence period has been characterised by economic mismanagement, corruption and cronyism. Western concerns over the countrys democratic credentials have hampered relations Opportunities With WTO membership secured, the pro-Western government may improve Ukraines prospects of a more formal trade arrangement with the EU Threats The new coalition government will remain shaky and vulnerable to internal wrangling. Renewed defections to rival parties may see the new government collapse within months of its formation Yushchenkos lame-duck presidency, and persisting influence of Yanukovichs Party of Regions in parliament, spell more bad news for Ukraines floundering NATO and EU membership bids - although this need not necessarily prevent progress in forging closer economic ties with the EU Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 SWOT Analysis Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Ukraine Economic SWOT Strengths The economy has rebounded strongly since 2000, prompted initially by recovery in Russia, and driven by a competitive exchange rate, ample spare capacity, and historically high metals prices. Consumer spending is benefiting from rapid real wage growth Robust economic performance and relatively low debt levels have greatly improved Ukraines access to international financial markets and its debt servicing capabilities, although international liquidity has been restricted by the global credit crisis Weaknesses There has been a sluggish pace of market reform since independence, leaving fundamentals relatively unsound and the economy overly vulnerable to elevated energy prices Opportunities The lack of an overriding orange majority in parliament is likely to see anti- Russian rhetoric reduced to a minimum in the new government. Indeed, this may see natural gas import costs to Ukraine rise only gradually Ukraine joined the WTO on February 6, which should help boost the countrys export sector in coming years Threats A sharp downturn in external markets for key Ukrainian commodity exports would hit the economy hard Ukraines privatisation programmes may be stalled further by a Tymoshenko-led government, with the new prime minister remaining suspicious of earlier sales of state assets Ukraine Business Environment SWOT Strengths At an estimated 46mn, Ukraine has the largest population in the region, after Russia The strong economic rebound of recent years, which has seen rising domestic consumption, has increased business opportunities in many sectors of the economy Weaknesses Although growing, disposable household income remains low Corruption remains a serious problem in Ukraine, with the country ranking 118 out of 179 rated countries in the latest Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index Opportunities Protectionism in key markets such as the US and EU has been particularly high on those products like metals and grain where Ukraine has a comparative advantage. Accession to the WTO would put the country in a better position to defend itself against accusations of dumping Threats Government economic policy is likely to remain politically motivated as parliamentary factions continue to compete for control and influence. Moreover, President Yushchenko remains reluctant to float Ukraines exchange rate, which remains pegged to a weak US dollar Transparency, such as in the conduct of privatisations, will remain largely elusive Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Table: World Ethylene Production By Country, 2008 And 2013 Country 2008e 2013f United States 29,270 27,770 Saudi Arabia 10,760 19,670 China 10,160 20,910 Japan 8,760 8,760 South Korea 7,490 7,690 Germany 5,745 5,745 Iran 5,606 9,006 Canada 4,951 4,951 Brazil 4,425 6,445 Taiwan 4,120 4,120 Netherlands 3,980 3,980 France 3,465 3,465 Russia 3,095 5,230 United Kingdom 2,885 2,885 India 2,850 7,300 Belgium 2,540 2,540 Thailand 2,480 4,470 Singapore 2,040 4,040 Malaysia 1,770 1,770 Mexico 1,580 2,580 Spain 1,480 1,480 Qatar 1,300 6,000 Kuwait 850 1,700 Argentina 755 755 Egypt 730 730 Poland 625 700 Hungary 620 620 Indonesia 620 620 UAE 600 2,050 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Global Market Overview Global Ethylene Capacities Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Table: World Ethylene Production By Country, 2008 And 2013 Country 2008e 2013f Venezuela 550 1,850 Czech Republic 525 595 Romania 520 520 Turkey 520 520 Australia 515 515 South Africa 500 500 Bulgaria 450 450 Israel 450 450 Nigeria 300 300 Azerbaijan 250 300 Central Asia 240 240 Slovakia 210 210 Algeria 130 1,230 Colombia 86 86 Chile 60 60 e/f = estimate/forecast. Source: BMI BMI estimates that total global ethylene capacity amounted to around 130mn tpa in 2008, with Asia Pacific representing 31% of installed capacity and North America a further 27%. Although the Middle East and Africa represents the largest source of oil and gas, the region contributed just 16% of total capacity. This is set to change over the medium to long term as new capacity comes online. The regions contribution to global capacity is forecast to rise from 11% in 2007 to 24% by 2012, in which year the region should represent 24% of global ethylene capacity, which we forecast will have reached 182mn tpa.Although Asia Pacific will have the strongest growth in demand for olefins, Ethylene Global Capacity By Region Asia Pacific*31% South America4% Middle East and Africa16% Eastern Europe4% NAFTA27% Western Europe15% * Includes Central Asia. Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 its contribution is likely to rise by just 2percentage points . Another region set to raise its global profile is South America, with significant new capacity set to come online in Brazil and Venezuela. Brazilianpetrochemicals giant Braskem is seekingto dominate production in the region andbecome a serious player on theinternational petrochemicals market; thecompany is ramping up capacity,including a world-scale ethylene jointventure in Venezuela. With Saudi Arabia and Qatar in particularramping up capacities with a number ofworld-scale projects, the feedstock willalso shift. At present, naphtha represents54% of feedstock for the worldscrackers, with ethane providing a further 28%. By 2012, BMI forecasts that ethane will represent around 45% of total feedstock, derived largely from the gasfields in the Arabian Gulf. Access to cheap feedstocks gives petrochemicals companies in the Arabian Peninsula and Iran an even greater cost advantage over producers elsewhere in the world, particularly in Europe and North America. Higher oil prices have led governments in the region to reinvest profits in constructing petrochemicals plants. By 2012, the Middle East and Africa will have nearly twice the capacity of Western Europe. Saudi Arabia accounts for almost half the US$250bn committed to petrochemicals projects in the Middle East, excluding Iran. Owing to this strong growth in capacity in the Gulfregion, investors will be reluctant toexpand capacity in North America andWestern Europe. Even debottleneckingexpansions could be abandoned owing toconcerns about feedstock costs and lossof competitiveness. An increased use of ethane and expansion of capacity should help raise margins.Ethane costs just over a third of the cost of naphtha and cracking margins are 6% higher. Naphtha prices have risen inline with crude, which had reached all-time highs by mid-2008. This caused ethylene contract prices to soar to over 70 cents per pound in July Ethylene Global Capacity By Region 2012f Eastern Europe4% Middle East and Africa24% South America5% NAFTA20% Western Europe11% Asia Pacific*33% f = forecast; * Includes Central Asia.

Average oil prices of US$60 per barrel or above make the Middle East the prime destination for investment, owing to access to low-cost ethane. However, the sharp decline in oil prices towards the end of 2008 and into 2009 should give naphtha-fed crackers a boost in competitiveness. The global slowdown is also a cause for concern for the petrochemicals industry, which will carry out large-scale capacity additions in 2009 and 2010, leading to a supply glut. Middle Eastern producers will be particularly affected as they are heavily reliant on exports, particularly to Asia. Already, Saudi projects are being delayed owing to a lack of buyers for their products as well as the global financial crunch, although this is expected to be a short-term phenomenon. In the long term, with Middle Eastern capacity growth rising faster than Chinese import growth, producers are likely to reduce operating rates. In 2008, significant parts of Chinas polyolefins market were in stagnation, with the situation likely to deteriorate further in 2009, putting pressure on olefins prices. Chinese ethylene self-sufficiency could top 60% by 2010, compared with 45% in 2006. The falling price of naphtha feedstock will also undermine the competitive advantage on which ethane-fed crackers in the Middle East rely to penetrate new markets. The downturn is not likely to last beyond 2010, as Chinese demand is likely to accelerate, with a supply gap exceeding 15bn tpa by the end of the next decade. Additionally, Chinese crackers are expected to struggle to find competitively priced sources of naphtha, thereby bolstering the penetration of Middle Eastern producers in Asian markets. Demand for polypropylene has been running at 7% on average over the past decade, which is well above global average economic growth. BMI estimates global PP demand at 48mn tonnes in 2008. The polymer is attractive as it can be used in a wide range of products and yet it is priced lower than other thermoplastics. In recent years, global PP prices have been pushed up by demand growth outstripping capacity additions and the effect of high oil prices on propylene feedstock. As with all petrochemicals commodities, the level of growth in China and India has been largely responsible for the pace of PP demand growth. Rising PP prices mean they are catching up with polyethylene prices, leading to a slackening in demand growth momentum. Nevertheless, PP consumption is set to exceed 50mn tonnes in 2010 and could reach 80mn tonnes by 2016, making it the worlds largest polyolefins market. As a result, global plant operating rates are expected to stay at around 80-90% of capacity, based on expected capacity growth. Most new capacity will come onstream in 2009-2012, causing a temporary decline in capacity utilisation. Demand growth is set to continue despite the global economic slowdown owing to a broadening of the variety of applications, particularly in the packaging, construction and automotive industries. The Asia Pacific region has become the worlds largest PP market and has led growth owing to rapid Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Polypropylene Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 industrialisation in China and India, which are driving PP demand as their demand growth rates exceed their growth in capacity. South America is also witnessing high rates of demand growth, although it will remain a smaller market than Europe and North America over the foreseeable future. BMI estimates that global PP capacity totalled 53mn tpa in 2008, with the US being the worlds largest PP producer with 17% of capacity, followed by China on 13%. Western European producing markets contributed a further 19%, while the Middle East despite its immense resources represented just 8%. The global landscape is set to radically shift over the next five years as demand and supply shift eastwards owing to growth in developed markets, according to BMI research. BMI estimates that the amount of added capacity in 2008 alone stood at over 4mn tpa, with a further 5mn tpa over the following two years. Capacity expansion is occurring during a period of economic downturn, leading to excess capacity. PP producers in the Middle East and Asia will firm up their positions on the global market, exporting their surpluses to the detriment of Western European and North American producers, which are unlikely to put significant new capacity online in coming years. BMI analysis indicates that profitability in Western Europe and North America will come under attack from cheap imports, and producers in these areas will struggle to maintain their competitiveness on export markets. BMI forecasts a net decline in PP capacity in these regions, with producers mothballing or closing older, smaller and less efficient plants of capacities under 200,000tpa and focusing their attention on increasing capacity at larger sites. Production is shifting eastwards, following the pattern of demand. BMI expects modest declines in US capacity over the next five years. US producers are set to devote an increasing amount of output to the domestic market as exports come underpressure from new capacity in the MiddleEast and Asia. Net exports are likely tofall to zero by 2012. The main challengefor the US is over-reliance on propylenederived from fluid catalytic cracker unitsin refineries. As refinery capacity isunlikely to keep up with the growingdemand for propylene feedstock, PPproducers will be forced to look to othersources to sustain output. According toBMI forecasts, US demand should reacharound 9mn tpa in 2009, an 18% riseover 2005 levels, leaving a net surplus ofaround 1mn tpa for export. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Regional Contribution To PP Capacity Expansion West Europe6% Japan1% Source: BMI Middle East23% Central and Eastern Europe3% Africa3% China23% Other Americas14% Other Asia23% Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 In Western Europe, BMI estimates show that the recovery in PP demand since 2005 tailed off considerably in 2008 as the regions economy slowed. Demand growth is set to be stronger in the Central and Eastern European markets over the next five years, although outside Russia there will not be any significant extra PP capacity coming online. This trend could lead to the EU becoming a net PP importer over the next five years. Producers are already closing PP plants and are instead focusing their attention on debottlenecking and expanding their other facilities. The stagnation in production in Europe and North America and slower demand growth rates stand in stark contrast to the surging Chinese market, which will become increasingly self-sufficient. China is now the worlds largest PP consumer, with BMI projecting demand reaching 11mn tonnes in 2010, a third more than in 2006. This is likely to lead to a deficit of over 1mn tonnes. However, the addition of 4mn tpa of PP capacity during 2008-2011, with other projects in the pipeline, should help to contain the growth in imports. According to BMI forecasts, China will represent 23% of the 14mn tpa of PP capacity that is due to come online worldwide between 2008 and 2012. The whole of Asia will represent just under half the additional capacity, while the Middle East will add a further 23%, largely owing to the developments in Saudi Arabia. There are no plans for additional capacity in the US, giving China the opportunity to become the worlds biggest PP-producing nation. Most of the contribution to capacity expansion in the Americas will be in Brazil, with 2mn tpa due to be added over the next five years. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, PP projects have faced delays. The opening of PetroRabighs 700,000tpa PP plant in Saudi Arabia was moved from Q408 to Q109, while the Sharq and Yansab complexes, which have a large amount of associated PP capacity, were also moved to 2009. Other PP plants due to come online in Saudi Arabia in 2009 include a 250,000tpa expansion of Saudi Polyolefins plant at Al-Jubail. Also at Al-Jubail, the Al-Waha Petrochemical joint venture between LyondellBasell and Sahara Olefins is due to add an extra 460,000tpa of PP. There are, however, significant risks facing PP producers. A stronger than expected slowdown in Chinese economic growth could lead to a glut in supply, driving down prices and forcing less competitive operations out of business. A combination of over-capacity and rising costs of raw materials could lead to the reduction of PP capacity in developed markets. A significant constraint facing the industry is the tightening of the propylene market as production of the monomer outstrips refinery output. Cuts in refinery throughput during the course of the global economic downturn will make this constraint more evident. As a result, some PP producers are considering plans to build plants dedicated to propylene production. While feedstock prices are set to rise, Chinese and Middle Eastern producers are managing to bring down prices of end products, leading to pressures on margins, particularly for producers in the developed world. The only way that they can stay afloat is to corner Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 niche markets with innovative products requiring greater technical sophistication than currently offered by plants in emerging markets. Efficiency in the manufacturing process also needs to be improved and markets developed. At the same time, energy and transportation prices are high, although they are easing with the decline in oil prices. Spinning The Wheels As a barometer for current and future products demand, the worlds autos industry continues to be a cause of great concern, in spite of government initiatives that have stabilised the situation. The industry is now just spinning its wheels while waiting for the recession to end and consumer activity to recover. European car sales rose in June for the first time in 14 months as government-backed incentives boosted demand at Volkswagen and Fiat in particular. New-car registrations increased by 2% to 1mn vehicles, the first monthly gain since April 2008, according to the Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers Association . Sales for the first six months of 2009 fell by 11% to 7mn cars. State scrappage incentives, topped by Germanys EUR2,500 bonus for car buyers who trade in old vehicles, have favoured sales of smaller models. So-called premium carmakers are not benefiting on the same scale. European deliveries by VW rose by 9% to 312,302 cars. Meanwhile, Turin-based Fiat recorded a 12% gain, selling 125,640 vehicles in the region. Germany led the June expansion, with a 41% sales surge, reflecting the generous terms of its incentives. The French market grew by 7%, while Italy advanced by 12%. Central and Eastern European demand continued to contract, declining by 25% in June and 27% for the first half of the year as a whole. Registrations for Mercedes-Benz slipped by 1% to 61,530 vehicles. BMWs European sales fell 13% to 60,454 cars. VWs Audi unit bucked the trend among premium brands, achieving a 5% gain to 62,639 cars and sports utility vehicles . However, a July 2009 report in the Wall Street Journal suggested that European car sales may slump in 2010 after scrappage programmes come to an end. Analysts quoted suggest that EU car plants will have an excess capacity of 7mn vehicles in 2010. The French government plans a gradual phase-out of its EUR1,000 car sales incentive, which had been due to expire at the end of 2009, a report in Les Echos stated, citing industry minister Christian Estrosi. While the scrappage bonus cannot be maintained indefinitely, the government is working on a phased withdrawal, Estrosi was quoted as saying. Renaults CEO Carlos Ghosn said in July that the expiry of Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Global Oil Products Market Review Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 state-backed incentives in France and elsewhere threatened to offset any improvement in demand and prevent a European sales recovery in 2010. In the US, it has been predicted that autos sales probably will rise to an annual rate of more than 10mn in H209 as fleet operators finally replace their ageing vehicles. Purchases in the first half of the year were abnormally low by historical standards. Fleet purchases, along with the federal governments scrappage programme, may push the annual rate to more than 9mn, the highest in any month so far this year. Sales of cars and light trucks in 2008 totalled 13mn. General Motors and Chrysler, which have both left bankruptcy, need a 10mn annual sales rate to break even, according to the US government. Fleet sales can account for as many as 3mn vehicles annually. However, rental-car companies such as Hertz have been keeping vehicles longer. Dean Maki, chief US economist at Barclays Capital, is among those predicting that automakers will crank up production to meet demand spurred by the scrappage programme. A rebound in the industrys output would help pull the economy out of the recession, he said. Nissan expects Japanese sales to improve in July, helped by government incentives. Under a government programme beginning on June 19, consumers can apply for a JPY250,000 subsidy if they scrap a car that is more than 13 years old to buy a new one and for JPY100,000 for a new car purchase without scrapping an old one. Chinese car sales have begun to pick up, after the earlier slump. VW, which is the biggest overseas carmaker in the country, boosted first-half sales in China by 23% after a government stimulus package helped spur demand. Sales to consumers jumped to 652,222 units. The overall passenger car market , grew 22% from a year earlier. China is on course to pass the US as the worlds largest auto market in 2009, after the government halved retail taxes on small cars and gave out subsidies in rural areas to help revive flagging demand. Demand In The Doldrums The downturn continued through the second quarter. In May, OECD oil products consumption fell by an estimated 7% year-on-year . Europe, Asian OECD states and North America registered losses for the 13th consecutive month. The Pacific region suffered particularly badly, with a decline in demand of more than 11%, in spite of greater gasoline usage. North Americas 8% fall was spread across all product groups. Europe fared better by comparison, with a 4% reduction in May demand. According to the International Energy Agency s July 2009 report, preliminary weekly data for the US showed an 8% y-o-y fall in June demand. All product categories bar residual fuel oil saw losses, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 scaring the bulls and undermining belief in the countrys economic recovery. The weakness in diesel demand is particularly worrying, as it is a barometer of underlying economic activity. According to the American Petroleum Institute , US demand for crude oil and petroleum products declined by 5% y-o-y during June. Total petroleum product deliveries, excluding exports, averaged 18mn barrels per day , down 1mn b/d from a year ago, the API said in its monthly oil report. Demand fell by 6% to 18mn b/d in the first half of 2009, the lowest level for the six-month period in more than 10 years. The downturn is having the greatest impact on distillate demand, with industrial and transportation use of diesel hit particularly hard. The situation for jet is no better, and gasoil consumption is sufficiently weak to see inventories in OECD Europe above the five-year average. In fact, Europe is storing up trouble with a glut of middle distillates. Much of an estimated 50mn bbl of products in floating storage is reportedly sitting offshore Europe. This bodes ill for prices over the next few months. False Dawn For Gasoline Bullish market observers will have been alarmed by the apparent absence of the seasonal upturn in US gasoline demand. Given that gasoline prices soared in June thanks to hopes of a good driving season, the market must now be very concerned about the likely trend for the rest of the summer. For a second year in a row, the US driving season either petered out early, or never got going at all. Gasoline demand actually fell by an estimated 1% y-o-y in June, early July data are not encouraging and the US-based American Automobile Association expects a drop in vehicle miles travelled . Gasoline prices took off in June, stirring hopes that it would be a strong US driving season. By 22 June, the average US regular gasoline price had reached US$2per gallon. At the beginning of the quarter the average price was US$2/gallon, so there had been an increase of almost one-third to the June peak. In mid-July, the price had fallen for the third week in a row, dropping to US$2/gallon. A year earlier it was US$4, but drivers did not respond by tackling long journeys. Prices decreased throughout the country, with the biggest drop seen in the Midwest. During Q209 BMI estimates that the global wholesale price for premium unleaded gasoline was US$69/bbl. Gasoline prices in Q209 were down from US$127in the equivalent period of 2008 . Fore the third quarter of the year we forecast an average global gasoline price of US$63/bbl. For the whole of 2009, the BMI assumption is an average US$62/bbl. The overall y-o-y fall in 2009 gasoline prices is 40%. Jet Jitters In July the International Air Transport Association reversed its rather optimistic prediction from the previous month that declines in the demand for air travel may have bottomed. It said that the May Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 2009 decline in the number of people flying was the biggest monthly fall for the year so far. Confidence has slipped among IATA members, and many carriers do not expect conditions to improve until the end of the year at the earliest. In its quarterly business confidence survey, the IATA reported that passenger travel numbers in May fell 9% during the month. All airlines surveyed were suffering through pricing declines, with half saying they expect yields to fall further this year. The cutting of fuel surcharges, the impact of swine flu and the downgrading to economy class have all contributed to airline misery, but the primary concern has been a glut of excess capacity. Capacity cuts have come at about half the rate of the declining traffic trend, putting pressure on prices, IATA said. The number of passengers flying on premium tickets fell by 23% y-o-y in May 2009, according to the IATA. That follows a 22% decline in April. Meanwhile, the number of passengers flying economy fell 7%, after growing 0% in April. Premium traffic in the North Atlantic was down by 16% in May y-o-y. Travel across the North and mid-Pacific was down by 30%, and travel in Europe was down 30%. Q2 losses at the eight biggest US airlines may be US$1bn, said Michael Linenberg, a Bank of America analyst in New York. Jet fuel prices climbed by 32% in the quarter, although the US$1/gallon average was down 58% y-o-y. According to the API, US jet fuel demand in June plunged by 19% y-o-y to 1mn b/d. Jet prices averaged US$66/bbl in Q209, using the composite for New York, Singapore and Rotterdam. The annual decrease was 57%, and the monthly low during the first half was US$53in February 2009, with the price reaching US$77/bbl in June 2009. For Q309 we are assuming an average global jet price of US$67. For 2009, the annual level is forecast to be US$65/bbl. This compares with US$124/bbl in 2008. Diesel Drifts In the US, mid-July diesel prices were almost 47% below the all-time high seen a year earlier, averaging US$2/gallon against US$4in July 2008. Prices had fallen for the third successive week, with declines seen in every region but the biggest drop taking place on the West Coast. US diesels low point was in mid-March 2009, at US$2/gallon. The years high of US$2was reached during the week of June 22, a rise of almost 30% from the low point. June US deliveries of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, declined by 279,000b/d to 3mn b/d, according to API data. Overall oil product demand in Europe during May fell by 4% y-o-y, with diesel down 3%, according to IEA data. In France, diesel demand contracted sharply and registered a 4% fall in May. The European gasoil market was expected to come under increased pressure in July on the back of huge export flows from the US and Russia. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Gasoil in Q209 averaged US$65/bbl, based on a composite global price. Our revised Q309 forecast is for global gasoil at an average US$ 68/bbl, a 51% y-o-y decline. For 2009 as a whole, the BMI forecast is for an average price of US$68/bbl, assuming a monthly high of US$92/bbl in December.

Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Petrochemical producers in the EU are coming under regulatory pressure that they claim is putting them at a disadvantage to their Middle Eastern, Asian and Russian rivals. However, BMI research finds that many of these claims are exaggerated and are unlikely to pose a significant problem to the competitiveness of European petrochemicals majors. In June 2007, the EUs regulation, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals directive came into force, despite concerns by industry bodies about its implementation and the possible adverse effects on competitiveness. REACH is the EUs new framework for registering and assessing chemicals and directly affects manufacturers, importers and users of chemicals across a wide range of sectors. It rationalises the EU regulatory system for chemicals, replacing over 40 pieces of legislation. The aim of the programme is to identify and phase out the most hazardous chemicals by requiring their substitution with safer alternatives wherever possible, as opposed to the old system based on establishing safe levels of chemical exposure. Each of the substances covered by REACH, but not products themselves, need to be registered with the new European Chemicals Agency , based in Helsinki, Finland. The onus is on the producer of final products to ensure that any imported substances are registered with the ECA in order to trade on the European market. REACH is being phased in with the most hazardous substances initially targeted. Registration is required for all substances supplied above one tonne per annum, covering over 30,000 substances. REACH is intended to: Increase knowledge of the hazards of chemicals; Only allow chemicals onto the market if specific safety data on them are made available; Detect, limit and when needed replace hazardous substances with safer alternatives; Reverse the burden of proof that chemicals are not dangerous from the public authorities and onto chemical manufacturers; and, Ensure that there is adequate information on all chemicals and that this information is communicated to all who come into contact with the chemicals from users to final consumers . Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 European Overview Regulation Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 While REACH may help protect the EU from hazardous imports, petrochemicals producers based in the EU claim they are being put at a disadvantage in the fastest-growing markets in Asia, notably China, at a time when producers in the Middle East, Russia and other emerging markets are ramping up capacity, with far lighter regulatory structures. The Middle East is expected to overtake Europe by 2015 when it is expected to account for about 20% of world ethylene capacity, against a projected 17% for Europe. At the same time, Chinas importance is increasing, with demand expected to keep rising by at least 9% per annum between 2007 and 2012 compared with around 2% for the US and the EU. However, the Chinese are also aiming to boost their capacity, making China a highly competitive market. As the Chinese increase their domestic capacity, Middle East producers are likely to turn to Europe to dispose of future surplus capacity. Russia too is expected to start investing heavily in petrochemicals in the next few years. Table: Key Elements Of REACH Registration A manufacturer or importer is required to register any substance they supply to the EU market above one tonne per year Evaluation The authorities carry out annual in-depth assessments of substances flagged as being of potential high risk Authorisation Supporters of REACH in the environmental lobby insist that the long-term direct costs are negligible compared with sales turnover and can be absorbed by the petrochemicals and chemicals industries. They point to a European Commission Extended Impact Assessment carried out in 2003, which estimated that the direct costs of REACH for the European chemicals industry would amount to a total of EUR2bn over a period of 11 years, representing 0% of the chemical industrys annual sales. While BMI agrees that large petrochemicals companies will be able to foot the bill for REACH, small and medium-sized enterprises will face significant adversity. In a report released before REACH was adopted in December 2006, Germanys Verband der Chemischen Industrie said the regulation imposes a considerable burden on small and medium sized enterprises in particular, owing to the problems they could face if suppliers no longer produce a substance they require in the manufacturing process. It adds: Small and medium-sized enterprises do not usually have the leverage to convince a supplier to register a product and document the specific use to which it is put. In many cases the only option remaining to a downstream user is to go through the protracted process of changing its formulation. The reformulation of large parts of their product portfolio is therefore a crucial cost factor for downstream users. However, there are few SMEs in Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 The use of substances of very high concern, e.g. CMRs (carcinogens, mutagens and toxic to reproduction), PBTs and vPvBs requires authorisation Agency A new EU Chemicals Agency based in Helsinki administers REACH, in co-operation with member states competent authorities Source: DEFRA, UK Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 the petrochemicals sector that would be directly affected by REACH. Economies of scale in the petrochemicals industry require large-scale production, effectively preventing the emergence of a significant number of SME producers in the sector. Moreover, REACH includes special provisions to help SME low-tonnage suppliers, with greatly reduced information requirements for substances supplied weighing between one and 10 tonnes and an 11-year registration period for registration of these substances; SMEs also benefit from reduced fees. In addition, REACH provides some benefits for SMEs, with most risk assessment for chemical substances undertaken by larger producers, which are required to share the data, a requirement that has been resisted by majors. As such, the impact of REACH across the petrochemical sector will be inconsequential to the competitiveness of European companies. EU chemicals output, excluding pharmaceuticals, fell by 22% y-o-y inJanuary 2009, according to the EuropeanChemical Industry Council .Meanwhile, business confidence among chemical industry managers continued to deteriorate in March, according to Cefic.However, price data showed that chemical products remained stable inJanuary, suggesting that output cuts had stabilised the market. Base chemicals registered the biggest drop in output inJanuary, while specialty chemicals and consumer chemicals recorded a less significant decline. For 2008 as a whole, the EU chemicals industry experienced a 4% decline in output. Ethylene production in Western Europe was down 8% to 19mn tonnes. Petrochemical prices grew by 7%, with polymers and specialty chemicals experiencing price changes of 2% and 3%, respectively. Output was well below its expectation of 2% growth at the beginning of 2008. The decline represented the first year of negative growth since 2003 and was related to the dramatic slowdown in EU economic activity and the sharp deceleration of world output and trade, according to Cefic. This was exacerbated by the financial crisis in H208, resulting in a stronger downturn in the construction and automotive sectors, which are among the top consumers of petrochemicals. However, the fall in output was not as great as in the US where production slumped 2%. BMI believes the decline will worsen if the EU economy goes into recession Cefics 2009 forecast is based on zero growth.

Other European producers including Arkema, DSM, and Rhodia have announced production cutbacks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 In Ukraine, the chemicals and petrochemicals industry has traditionally been considered fundamental to the economy, owing to the role it plays in manufacturing intermediates. The government has begun to gradually implement financial reforms and privatisation legislation allowing foreign participation in the industry. A strategic plan for the chemicals industry up to 2010 has been developed. This includes expanding the output and range of fertiliser and plant protection agents, improving non-toxic packaging materials for the food-processing industry, expanding the range of chemicals for light industry and developing new chemical materials for the high-technology industries. However, much of the planning may have been seriously damaged by the recent decline in output and pressures on the industry. Eastern European companies have increased their sales activity in Ukraine in recent years. Czech-based Chemopetrol increased its sales volume by a factor of 20, while the Hungarian Tiszai Vegyi Kombint increased sales 100-fold. Over the same period, sales volumes of Russian producers declined in Ukraine. The chemicals industry in Ukraine comprises chemicals, petrochemicals and chemical-pharmaceutical sub-segments, with more than 1,600 enterprises and structural units. The chemicals sub-segment accounts for nearly 17% of the production, while the petrochemicals and chemical-pharmaceutical sub-segments account for the remainder. The petrochemicals industry manufactures a variety of products, including car and motorcycle tyres , hoses and consumer goods. Petrochemicals and rubber-asbestos enterprises are concentrated in the regions of Donbas, Prydniprovia, Prysivashia and Prykarpattya. The major centres include Kyiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Shostka, Sumy and Rubizhne. Considerable structural changes are underway in the chemicals and petrochemicals industry. State-owned enterprises constitute less than one-fifth of the total number of petrochemicals facilities, and account for about one-third of the products. KarpatNaftoKhim operates a petrochemicals plant including a 250,000tpa ethylene cracker at Kalush. The nations other cracker is situated at the Linos oil refinery, and has a production capacity of 300,000tpa. The countrys only PP plant is operated by TNK-BP. From January 1 2006, TNK-BP has been refining its oil in Ukraine at the Lisichansk oil refinery, which is owned and managed by CJSC LINIK. Oriana at Kalush in the Ivano-Frankivsk region is Ukraines largest petrochemicals enterprise. It has 10 independent plants and a number of auxiliary workshops and services, and produces more than 100 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Ukraine Market Overview Market Structure Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 commodities, including olefins, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda and antistatic. It also operates a potassium fertiliser plant as well as ethylene, propylene and benzene units.

Ukraine is in last place in BMIs CEE Petrochemicals Business Environment matrix this quarter with 38points. Ukraines uncertain political environment coupled with rising gas import prices and the possibility of supply disruption are undermining the countrys potential for increased petrochemicals production capacity. The situation has deteriorated since last quarter, with a sharp downturn in the domestic economy, coupled with tightening credit conditions and a decline in key markets. The sector is dominated by Russian petrochemicals majors and remains tied into the old Soviet economic framework as a satellite of Russia. Diversification of feedstock and markets could ensure stable growth in the long term.

Ukraine scores just 33points, owing to a reassessment of polymer production capacities. Ukraine has the lowest polymer capacity in the region, with just one PP plant with a capacity of 200,000tpa and a polyvinyl chloride facility with a nameplate capacity of 55,000tpa. The country has an ethylene production capacity of 550,000tpa, putting it slightly ahead of Romania. The score will improve if the Azot PE plant, with a capacity of 150,000tpa, is brought back into operation and with the development of new PVC production facilities. The country structure rating comprises BMIs scores for financial and physical infrastructure and trade bureaucracy. Ukraine scores a poor 44points, which is well behind the regional average of 59points. Ukraine has passed a number of legislative reforms that will underpin the development of the legal infrastructure necessary to support foreign investment, but reform is ongoing. The government has embarked on market liberalisation, cutting back on regulation and removing many licensing requirements. Most restrictions on foreign exchange transactions have also been removed. Foreign businesses dealing with the country cite confusing, ill-defined regulations as a major hindrance to trade. The changed political environment and a willingness to open up the countrys borders enough to permit entry to the WTO and acquire better trading terms with major blocs may now start to yield more rapid results. This rating comprises the ratings for market and country risks, weighted towards market risks. The market risk rating measures the regulatory environment of the petrochemicals sector. Ukraine scores 40points, with its score under pressure in recent months owing to the sectors vulnerability to supply cuts from Russia, which was demonstrated in January 2009 when Gazprom cut gas supplies to Ukraine. Members of Ukraines main government security agency service, the Sluzhba Bezpeky Ukrayiny , raided the headquarters of Ukrainian state-run gas company Naftogaz on March 4, in an apparent attempt to acquire a copy of the original contract signed on January 19, between Naftogaz and Gazprom which ended the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. The raid appears to be the latest event in an increasingly bitter power struggle between Ukraines prime minister, Yulia Timoshenko, and president, Viktor Yushchenko, over the countrys energy industry. The dispute could have serious implications for the near-term flow of Russian gas to and through Ukraine. Despite Ukraines large domestic market and strong economic potential, most foreign investors have to date been deterred by the poor business environment. President Viktor Yushchenkos victory in 2004 had obvious positive implications for improvements in the business environment. Reforms have been centred on WTO accession, which was approved in February 2008, with Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Risks To Realisation Of Returns Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 membership officially attained in May. On the upside, the petrochemicals sector is not encumbered by the environmental regulations imposed on neighbouring countries that have joined the EU. The Ukrainian petrochemicals sector is oriented to serving the Ukrainian and Russian economies, which means that it is largely unaffected by REACH. Nevertheless, Ukrainian production units are dependent on Russian suppliers and investors, making them vulnerable to Russias interests, which are often oriented towards its political objectives. The country risk rating covers the long-term economic, financial and political risks and the structure of the economy. Ukraine scores just 40points, owing to deterioration in the long-term financial and external risk scores, with foreign investors wary of the elevated international risk scenario. The overall business environment can be considered unattractive, largely owing to a high level of perceived political risk, only moderate progress in deregulation and competition, plus limited growth potential in oil and gas production. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Industry Trends And Developments The petrochemicals sector in Ukraine could face collapse owing to plummeting output and a sharp decline in domestic demand and export. The economic outlook for the country as a whole is dire. Output decline hasfollowed the trend of theeconomic cycle. In 2008,the chemical andpetrochemical indexsuggested that the volume of production fell by 3% over the year. The decline was more marked in H208, with output in this sector declining by nearly 40% in December 2008, according to BMI estimates. However, Ukraines largest petrochemicals producer, KarpatNaftoKhim, had announced as early as February 2008 that it was considering suspending operations owing to a drop in demand for ethylene in Europe, and reportedly paused operations at its major facilities in July. All petrochemicals segments were affected by the sharp downturn, with producers idling capacity in sectors such as PVC by the end of the year and delaying construction plans. Then, in January 2009, chemicals and petrochemicals production shrank by close to 50%, as the sector effectively ground to a halt during the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, which saw gas supplies to Ukraine cut off for nearly three weeks. This was in contrast to 2006 and 2007, when chemicals and petrochemicals industrial growth was 3% and 6%, respectively, and contrary to projections from within the sector. At the same time, the fertiliser sector has suffered owing to earlier gas supply cuts from Russia. In July 2009, TNK-BP announced it had increased to almost 100% its effective stake in its main Ukrainian asset, the Lysychansk oil refinery. It is intent on modernising and expanding Ukrainian refining capacities with a view selling high-quality car fuel. In March 2008, KarpatNaftoKhim, part of Russias Lukoil Group chemicals division Lukoil-Neftekhim, began construction of a new PVC plant in Kalush. Run by Lukoils Ukrainian subsidiary, Zao Lukor, the Kalush-based firm is investing around US$210mn to establish Ukraines first PVC production facility, with planned capacity of 300,000tpa. Uhde has been appointed the contractor for the plant. The new unit was expected to be completed and operating some time during 2009. However, the Ukrainian Petrochemical And Chemical Production Indices, 2000-2008 Index, percent oftheprevious year Industry Chemical and Petrochemical Source: Ukraine State Statistics Committee Business Monitor International Ltd Page 29 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 slump in the PVC market casts doubt on the viability of the operation, which could be delayed until 2010. The KarpatNaftoKhim plant would produce plastic for windows and aluminium window profiles, which Ukraine currently does not produce. The investment is in addition to the US$600mn that Lukoil-Neftekhim is investing in the construction of a chlor-alkali plant also at Kalush. KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of the new plant in June 2007. The new facility will have capacity to produce about 206,000tpa of caustic soda and 181,000tpa of chlorine, and was originally expected to come online in Q208. However, the plants opening has been repeatedly postponed, with KarpatNaftoKhim announcing a further delay in March 2009. The plant is now scheduled to come onstream in Q309. KarpatNaftoKhim discontinued operations at its old chlorine and caustic soda facility in August 2006, largely owing to the impact of high raw-material and energy costs. Together, the two projects in Kalush will establish a major industrial petrochemicals and plastics facility sufficient to supply the construction sector. Currently, raw materials from KarpatNaftoKhim are exported to other countries in the region, where they are processed and re-imported as finished products. In April 2007, the Russian-British company TNK-BP outlined plans to invest around US$400mn in its operational and marketing assets development in Ukraine during 2007-2010. It has suggested the scale of investment will depend on the countrys investment climate. Company executives have complained that the government has dragged out negotiations over refining investment, with little progress since mid-2006. The main reason for the delays is the deteriorating political situation, which is undermining the business environment. Additionally, TNK-BP claims that the government owes it US$64mn in VAT refunds and is dragging its feet on repayment, owing to political issues concerning the governments financial programme. The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute dominated the last quarter, with the row having devastating effects on the already troubled petrochemicals sector in Ukraine. Chemicals and petrochemicals production shrank by close to 50% in January 2009 as the sector effectively ground to a halt during the dispute. Continuing tensions further threaten future output levels and prospects for the sector. In early January 2009, the Kremlin cut off gas supplies running through Ukraines pipelines, which deliver around 80% of Russias gas exports to Europe that is, around one-fifth of Europes gas leaving many European customers without gas for nearly two weeks. Russia initially cut supplies to Ukraine on January 1 after the two countries failed to agree on a 2009 supply deal. Six days later, gas exports to Europe flowing through Ukraine were stopped after Russia accused Kiev of stealing gas. Exports were resumed on January 20 with the signing of a 10-year supply and transit contract. The transit deal should see Russian gas monopoly Gazprom export 120bcm of gas to Europe via Ukraine in 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Upstream Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Ukraine is set to import 40bcm, according to the supply deal, although Kiev said it only needs 33bcm from Russia to partially meet its 2009 needs of 56bcm. Ukrainian gas will contribute 20bcm. There is a possibility that Ukraine so badly hit by the economic crisis will be unable to meet Russian payment demands. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promised in March 2009 that Moscow would not push Ukraine over the edge with high gas bills, saying that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. However, Putin had earlier threatened that Russia would cut off supplies if bills went unpaid. Tensions over gas payments have also revived feuding between Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. According to state gas company Naftogaz, Ukraine imported 49bcm for domestic use in 2008. In late March 2009, Russia broke off talks with Ukraine on a US$5bn loan to shore up its economy, after Kiev asked the EU to help modernise its pipeline network with a view to increasing capacity, a move welcomed by the EU. Russia was angered at not being included in discussions, although Kiev maintained that there had been talks with Moscow. Russia has said that it wants to be involved in any modernisation, thus helping to secure gas supply to Europe, but some analysts suggest that Russia is trying to gain control of the strategic pipelines. Russian officials warned of further gas supply disruptions if the countrys interests were ignored. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine over unpaid gas supplies had earlier threatened to undermine supply of feedstock to the countrys fertiliser industry. In March 2008, Gazprom cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine by 25%, and threatened to cut a further 25% if Ukraine did not settle a US$600mn gas bill and sign contracts for the supply of gas in 2008. In response, Ukraine has accused Gazprom of failing to pay any gas transit fees since December 2007, a charge disputed by the Russians, who contest that no bill has been sent by Ukraine. Naftogaz paid its debts to Gazprom in full on March 5 2009, averting fears of a repeat of the January disruptions to European gas supply. Following a warning from Russian Prime Minister Putin that gas deliveries to Ukrainian and European consumers would be halted unless Naftogazs debt for February gas deliveries was paid in full by March 7, the Ukrainian company sent Russia the final instalment of the US$360mn bill. Gazprom confirmed shortly afterwards that the payment had been received. In light of pressure on Ukraine to develop its own gas reserves, Chornomornaftogaz a wholly owned subsidiary of Naftogaz with responsibility for developing the offshore fields in the Black and Azov Seas signed a memorandum of understanding with China National Offshore Oil Corp in February 2009 to bring China into a project building a pipeline to the Odessa gas deposits. The Ukrainian government is yet to approve the MoU. In addition, Chornomornaftogaz reports that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering investing in the Black Sea fields. In November 2008, Naftogaz requested a US$476mn investment by the state in developing the Odessa, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Bezymyanny and Subbotin fields. The draft state budget in September 2008 had reportedly allocated around US$80mn to the project, although it is unclear if that amount has been reallocated in light of Ukraines economic troubles. Ukraine has six oil refineries, most of which are Russian-owned, with a combined capacity of 51mn tpa. In recent years, the load rate of refineries has declined, with the deterioration of the infrastructure and the temporary halting of the work of the Odessa and Kherson refineries leading to a 30% efficiency rate. Ukrainian refineries fail to meet Euro-5 standards and only the Lysychansk refinery is able to produce oil to Euro-4 standards and the Odessa refinery complies with Euro-3. All other refineries are unable to even meet Euro-2 compliance. However, the Oil and Gas Journal reported in March 2009 that Paris-based Axens has been awarded a contract to upgrade the gasoline pool at the Kremenchug refinery, which will enable the production of Euro-5 grade gasoline by 2011. The 360,000b/d refinery has the largest throughput capacity in Ukraine and the upgrade is the first of its kind in the country. In addition, TNK-BP said that it had completed upgrades on its Lysychansk refinery, which would see the plant through to 2010, and was considering investing some US$41mn in 2009 to modernise its Linos refinery. The company also announced its intentions to maintain production levels of oil products in 2009, despite falling consumption. TNK-BP, which refined 10mn tonnes of gas and oil condensates in 2008, hopes to pick up the slack from declining imports. The volume of oil refining of Ukrainian refineries meets only 80% of demand and the country is heavily dependent on imported oil, even with a major decline in demand since independence. Despite some efforts at exploration, oil production has remained relatively stable since 1991, with the Oil and Gas Journal putting the countrys proven reserves at 395mn bbl in 2007. Poor capacity utilisation has an impact further downstream, raising prices and causing a squeeze on naphtha supply for feedstock for the petrochemicals sector. However, small-scale progress has been reported at the Lelyaki oil field, which is being developed by the Kashtan Petroleum JV. Output is now 400bbl/d and further wells are to be drilled in 2009. In June 2008, details emerged of a plan to build a new oil refinery in Ukraine to process Caspian oil, although the current status of the project is unclear. The refinery would be a joint project involving Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and the EBRD. The refinery would cost US$4bn to build over a three- to five-year period. Possible sites include the Odessa or Lviv regions. The refinery would help overcome Ukraines infrastructural problems in the refining sector and will meet Euro-5 standards, enabling it to supply the EU market. Production at the refinery is expected to reach 10mn tpa of oil. In Q108, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine accused TNK-BP of being a monopolist, claiming that there was a correlation between the Lisichansk and Kremenchug refineries that suggested inflated price-fixing. TNK-BP has strongly denied the accusations. In a statement released in March, the company pointed out that imports account for 40-60% of the fuel market with the share of domestic refiners not Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 exceeding 50%. It claimed that the Lisichansk refinery was loss-making and was only able to defend its existing market share with no plans to expand and push back the market share of foreign producers. Concluding, the company said that prices were determined by market forces and competition with imports and that it was therefore unable to determine fuel prices on the Ukrainian market. If the Antimonopoly Committee takes action, it could seek to split up the companys activities in the refining, wholesale and retail areas. This would disrupt the vertical integration of the petrochemicals company. Ukraine formally acceded to the WTO in May 2008, having secured approval of its membership bid in February that year. For Ukraines petrochemicals producers, WTO membership is a major positive step, easing access to both raw materials and promising better access to Western markets in the future. After the political chaos of the last few years, accession underlines for big business at least that the newly installed government under Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is capable of delivering on trade and economic policy. Membership effectively ends Ukraines trade agreement with Russia, which enables Russian petrochemicals to be exported to Ukraine free of duty. Under WTO rules, Ukraine will be unable to grant preferential import tariffs. Russian petrochemicals products will be subject to a 10% tariff. This will be of benefit to Ukrainian producers of raw materials, but will push up the cost of feedstock for plants operating further downstream, which often rely on raw-materials imports from Russia. WTO Accession Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Ukrainian plastics production failed to show any recovery in output in H109. Sales by the chemicals and petrochemicals industries in January-May totalled UAH15bn, including UAH11bn of chemicals and UAH4bn of rubber and plastics products. In the first five months of the year, output totalled 113,400 tonnes. In May, monthly plastic production was 23,200 tonnes, 1,300 tonnes up on April, but still below Februarys level and well down on typical output levels. Over the January-May period, overall chemicals and petrochemical production was down 35% y-o-y, although the rate of decline was easing. The figures are not surprising given that Ukraine is one of the worlds worst-hit countries in the global economic crisis. In H109, industrial output was down 31% y-o-y while construction was the hardest hit sector, falling by around a half. Even the fertiliser segment, which is traditionally more stable than other major petrochemical consumers such as the automotive and construction industries, reported a 22% decline in production volumes in the first five months of the year despite modest growth in agriculture. The steep recession comes after a prolonged period of economic growth, when economic growth averaged around 7%. The IMF has forecast that Ukraines economy will shrink by 8% in 2009, while the World Bank says the fall will be more than 9%. BMI is forecasting a contraction of 14% in line withthe expectations of many Ukrainian analysts, with key petrochemicals-consuming industries the worst hit. At the same time, the outlook for petrochemicals exports is bleak with the Russian, Turkish and EU markets also set to see sharp declines in demand. With the kind of economic growth rates seen in 2000-2007 unlikely to be repeated, the petrochemicals industry will be more heavily reliant on export markets. The depreciation of the hryvnia may provide some slight relief in terms of competitiveness, but equally it raises the cost of feedstock that has to be passed on to the consumer or absorbed by a financially precarious petrochemicals industry. If the demand does not exist, then depreciation is unlikely to make a significant difference. Russian economic growth is not likely to be remarkable over the forecast period and the market is at risk of over-capacity owing to additional planned capacity due to come online. Consequently, Ukrainian producers will be more reliant on the eurozone for sales. The petrochemicals industry is set to receive a temporary domestic boost from increased construction activity ahead of Ukraines hosting of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. A diversification in markets and feedstock sourcing to remove the industrys dependence on domestic and Russian demand would enhance prospects. In 2010, we expect petrochemicals output growth of 6%, rising to 8% per annum in 2011-2013, in line with the pro-cyclical nature of the industry. This means it could take up to four or five years to recover from the losses in H208 and 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Industry Forecast Scenario Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Added to that is the strongly pro-cyclical trend evident in the petrochemicals sector, with peaks being higher than average industrial output and troughs a lot lower. As industrial output plunges, petrochemicals production will fall at a faster rate. As a result, new capacity plans such as the PVC plant in Kalush are likely to be halted or abandoned altogether as credit availability dries up and demand collapses both at home and among Ukraines main trading partners. Lukoil-Neftekhim began construction of a US$250mn PVC plant at Kalush in Q108, whose output will include 300,000tpa of PVC, in addition to a US$600mn chlorine and sodium hydroxide plant. BMI doubts that construction will be completed until 2010 or later owing to the depth and length of Ukraines economic recession. In the long term, the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector will depend on a continuous and reliable source of feedstock. According to a study by the Ukrainian National Academy of Science, Ukraines natural gas consumption could double by 2030, while the countrys natural gas production may only increase by 33% over that period. Supplies from Russia have been subjected to severe political disputes between the two countries that may not have been conclusively resolved. In March, Naftogaz paid its overdue debts to Gazprom in full, averting fears of a repeat of the disruptions to European gas supply in January 2009. Following a warning from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that gas deliveries to Ukrainian and European consumers would be halted unless Naftogazs debt for February gas deliveries was paid in full by March 7, the Ukrainian company sent Russia the final instalment of the US$360mn bill two days before the deadline. Although clearing its debt for February will give Naftogaz a temporary respite, concerns are already mounting over the companys ability to pay for its gas supplies in March, with the bill expected to be in excess of US$1bn unless Gazprom grants Naftogazs request to reduce its gas import obligations for the month. In addition, the escalation of political conflict between former Orange Revolution allies President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko demonstrated in dramatic fashion by the raid on Naftogazs offices in March by the Ukrainian security service suggests further risks to the robustness of the gas supply contract agreed with Russia following the January gas dispute. Naftogaz Ukrainy is considering other sources of natural gas, including Iran and Norway. With construction of a gas pipeline from Iran to Armenia under development, Ukraine believes that an Iran-Armenia-Georgia-Crimea pipeline is possible, linking the pipeline from Georgia across the Black Sea to Ukraines Crimean port of Feodosia. Iran is looking to increase its natural gas imports to Europe, and Ukraine is interested in maintaining its position as the major transit point for natural gas to Europe. However, the distance and substantial projected cost of such a pipeline has so far inhibited the implementation of this plan. BMI estimates that gas demand will rise from 66bn cubic metres in 2006, through 69bcm in 2007 to 80bcm by 2011. Domestic production should also increase, from 19bcm in 2007 to at least 22bcm in 2010-2011. The import requirement is therefore set to rise from 48bcm to 58bcm over the period. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Any level of uncertainty concerning feedstock will have negative consequences for the petrochemicals sector, with a shortage of feedstock for its cracker units. BMI believes that gas price hikes will lead to a downturn in ethylene output, with exports projected to decline to zero over the forecast period. Ethylene output will be in the range of 525,000-535,000tpa over the next five years. Cuts in ethylene output will increase dependency on PE imports, with the domestic industry without a ready availability of feedstock. Ukraine is also set to become more dependent on PP imports. An improvement in the business environment and greater certainty over gas imports and prices would alleviate some of the problems facing the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. At present, the deteriorating domestic political environment makes it unlikely that Ukraine will see an expansion in production capacity over the next two to three years.

Source: BMI, UN COMTRADE Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Full-Blown Crisis AvertedFor Now The IMFs decision to release the second tranche in emergency financing to Ukraine will help ward off the most dire of crisis scenarios unfolding in the short term. That said, taking into account an array of leading indicators, in addition to our below consensus regional growth forecast, we maintain our view that Ukraines economy will be the worst performing in the world in 2009, with real GDP set to contract by 14% accordingly. While the IMFs decision to release the second tranche of emergency financing under Ukraines US$16bn Stand-By Arrangement has helped reduce the likelihood of a full-blown macroeconomic and financial market crisis scenario emerging in the short term, we see little additional cause for optimism going forward. Indeed, though this external support will help provide a modicum of stability to both the external and fiscal accounts, it will not be able to offset the more pronounced impact of collapsing external demand for key exports, an acute capital shortage, ongoing domestic banking sector instability, and elevated political risks. As such, we maintain our view that Ukraines economy will be the worst performing in the world in 2009, with real GDP forecast to contract by 14%. Exporters To Continue Suffering Through End-Year The outlook on Ukraines export sector remains bleak, with the steel and chemical industries likely to suffer disproportionately this year. The recent downward revisions to our Russian, Turkish and eurozone growth forecasts this year, which sees real GDP contracting by a whopping 7%, 5% and 4%, respectively, helps to underpin this view. With these markets absorbing approximately 23%, 8% and 16% of Ukrainian goods, we caution that the current downturn will continue to be predicated in large part on developments in these neighbouring economies. As a consequence, though the Ukrainian hryvnias rapid depreciation in Q408 would, under normal circumstances, help buttress growth by increasing the export sectors competitiveness, we nevertheless maintain our core view that the outright collapse in external demand in these key trading partners will offset much of the potential positive impact on exports of the devaluation. According to the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine, industrial production continued to collapse in March, contracting by 30% year-on-year . This marked the sixth consecutive month of double-digit declines in IP, and the third straight month where production contracted by over 30% y-o-y. Moreover, looking at the full breakdown of individual IP components, falls in chemical and petrochemical and metallurgy production, which form the backbone of the countrys export industry, continue to take place at an alarming rate. Indeed, between January and March, production in these components fell by 38% y-o-y and 43%, respectively. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Macroeconomic Outlook Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 In addition, after first highlighting the ongoing decline in freight transport back in January - an indicator which can be used as a proxy for export levels - volumes have since fallen off the cliff. According to latest data, freight shipping contracted by 32% y-o-y through the first three months of the year, after having posted an average rate of growth of 5% in 2008. Taken together, we believe these leading indicators are indicative of the dire outlook on Ukraines export sector, and have pencilled in a contraction of 25% y-o-y for exports accordingly. Private Consumption Will Provide Little Respite Given our still cautious outlook on Ukraines domestic banking sector, with credit conditions unlikely to improve through the medium term, we hold a similarly pessimistic view on private household consumption in 2009, and forecast a contraction of 17% accordingly. Moreover, though consumer price inflation has fallen by a cumulative 13percentage points since 2008s high of 31% y-o-y recorded in May, it nevertheless remains a cause for concern in the short term. Indeed, with BMI currently pencilling in an average annual rate of inflation of 19% this year, we caution that real wage growth will continue to suffer through the medium term, and expect household consumption to remain under pressure as a result. To be sure, through the first three months of the year, real wage growth contracted by 12% y-o-y, after having posted an average rate of growth of 6% in 2008. As real wage growth remains under pressure, we expect the outright negative trend in retail trade which began in April 2008 to gather further momentum going forward. After having expanded by a remarkable 20% y-o-y in 2008, retail sales have since collapsed, contracting for three consecutive months, and coming in at -16% y-o-y in March. GFCF To Fare No Better Underscoring our projection for gross fixed capital formation to contract by a whopping 22% this year, is latest data on construction volumes throughout Ukraine. Between January and March, construction volumes fell by an astonishing 56% y-o-y, compared to growth of 1% during the same period a year earlier. With firms across the region continuing to come under substantial pressure shoring up their home operations, we do not believe international investors will be eager to undertake investment projects in emerging markets. This is especially the case for countries with as high a macroeconomic and political risk profile as Ukraine. Indeed, in BMIs proprietary risk ratings, Ukraine possesses the lowest short-term economic and political risk ratings in the entire emerging Europe region . Beyond 2009: Trend Growth Subdued Though the macroeconomic and financial market maelstrom engulfing Ukraine will likely persist through the end of the year, we nevertheless maintain our view for growth to recover to 1% in 2010, before Business Monitor International Ltd Page 38 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 ticking higher to 3% in 2011. That said, we caution that this recovery will be more a product of low base effects than any meaningful improvement in economic activity. To be sure, we caution that the 2009 economic crisis will drastically reduce living standards in the country, with real GDP per capita set to decrease to US$2,115 this year, from US$3,969 in 2008, and coming in at only US$3,771 by 2012. Moreover, we reiterate our long held view that over the longer term, with international credit markets not likely to return to pre-crisis levels, trend growth will take place on a significantly lower trajectory than recorded in the past, with BMI pencilling in an average rate of real GDP growth of only 3% between 2010 and 2013.

Source: State Statistics Committee Business Monitor International Ltd Page 39 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Background Company Data KarpatNaftoKhim, previously known as Lukor, is Ukraines only producer of VCM, and is a major producer of olefins, polyolefins and other petrochemicals. KarpatNaftoKhim was established in October 2004 after closure of the main facilities of the JV Lukor. In June 2006, Lukoil-Neftekhim announced plans to invest an additional US$100mn in the statutory fund of KarpatNaftoKhim, if it agreed to sign an amicable agreement after disputes regarding operations. KarpatNaftoKhim operates a petrochemicals complex at Kalush in Ukraine. The closed-end JSC Lukor was established by Lukoil-Neftekhim and the Ukrainian open-end JSC Oriana on December 6 2000, with a statutory fund of UAH1bn . Lukoil-Neftekhim had a 52% stake in the project, while Oriana held the remaining 48%. Lukoil has been one of the largest investors in the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. KarpatNaftoKhim is the nations only producer of LDPE and VCM and a major producer of ethylene, propylene, benzene, caustic soda and other petrochemicals products. It has the capacity to produce 100,000 tonnes of PE, 370,000 tonnes of VCM and 250,000tpa of ethylene. The company exports most of its petrochemicals products to Russia, the EU and Turkey. In March 2008, KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of a new PVC plant in Kalush. Around US$210mn is being invested to establish Ukraines first PVC production facility, with planned capacity of 300,000tpa. Uhde has been appointed the contractor for the plant. The new unit was expected to be completed and operating some time during 2009. However, the slump in the PVC market casts doubt on the operations viability. It could be delayed until 2010. The KarpatNaftoKhim plant would produce plastic for windows and aluminium window profiles, which Ukraine currently does not produce. The investment is in addition to the US$600mn that Lukoil-Neftekhim is investing in the construction of a chlor-alkali plant also at Kalush. KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of the new plant in June 2007. The new facility will have capacity to produce about 206,000tpa of caustic soda and 181,000tpa of chlorine, and was originally expected to come online in Q208. However, the plants opening has been repeatedly postponed, with KarpatNaftoKhim announcing a further delay in March 2009.

The outlook for the petrochemicals is so poor, however, that there is a chance that these projects will be further delayed, or even abandoned. KarpatNaftoKhim already reportedly suspended operations temporarily in July 2008, owing to a decline in demand for ethylene. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 TNK-BP Background Company Data TNK-BP Ukraine began operations on June 11 2004. Linos had been TNK-BPs main refinery asset in Ukraine. Russian oil group TNK owned a 78% stake in the Linos oil refinery and petrochemicals complex situated in the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine. TNK-BP was formed in 2003 by the merger of TNK and BPs Russian business and has interests in Ukraines downstream sector. The company has a 78% interest in the 320,000b/d capacity LiNOS refinery in the eastern Lugansk region, although its actual share of production is lower. The facility also incorporates the countrys sole polypropylene facility. In addition, TNK-BP operates a network of over 925 franchised service stations. The firm also owns a share of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline, which supplies the Pivdennyi Oil Export Terminal. While there is no upstream exposure and little scope for the Anglo-Russian group to establish a presence, the company is strong in refining and fuels distribution. All Ukraines refineries operate well below design capacity, are relatively inefficient and lack complexity. TNK-BP has an opportunity to upgrade, raise throughput and feed a growing chain of outlets as the local market grows. However, the investment climate in Ukraine remains uncertain, which will be a concern for BP in particular. TNK-BP corporate centre in Ukraine manages the groups enterprises, including sales and production facilities and investment companies. The complex includes a cracker with an ethylene production capacity of 300,000tpa that is also capable of producing propylene, as well as the countrys only PP plant. However in February 2006, it was reported that TNK-BP had stopped using the services of Linos. The agreement with Linos on the lease of the refinery has been cancelled. From January 1 2006, TNK-BP has been refining its oil in Ukraine at the Lisichansk oil refinery, owned and managed by CJSC LINIK. In November 2006, the Lisichansk oil refinery announced a planned processing capacity of about 260,000 tonnes of oil. The plant had undergone an annual maintenance turnaround procedure to rebuild the reactor block and to replace the vacuum gas-oil catalyser of the catalytic cracking unit. The project also included replacing the piping of the hydrogen furnaces, the control equipment Address TNK-BP Ukraine 12 Vladimirskaya Street 01025 Kyiv, Ukraine Tel: +380 4449 29777 Fax: +380 4449 29888 Web: www.tnk-bp.com.ua Key Statistics Year incorporated: 2000 Key Personnel President : Alexander Gorodetsky Vice-President (TNK-BP Ukraine): Sergey Lizunov Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 and system for oil-processing. In April 2007, TNK-BP outlined plans to invest around US$400mn in its operational and marketing assets development in Ukraine in 2007-2010. It has suggested the scale of investment will depend on the countrys investment climate. Executives have complained that the government has dragged out negotiations over refining investment, with little progress since mid-2006. The main reason for the delays is the deteriorating political situation, which is undermining the business environment. TNK-BP claims that the government owes it US$64mn in VAT refunds and is dragging its feet on repayment, owing to political issues concerning the governments financial programme. TNK-BP said in early 2009 that it had completed upgrades on its Lysychansk refinery, which would see the plant through to 2010, and was considering investing some US$41mn in 2009 to modernise its Linos refinery. The company also announced its intentions to maintain production levels of oil products in 2009, despite falling consumption. TNK-BP, which refined 10mn tonnes of gas and oil condensates in 2008, hopes to pick up the slack from declining imports. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Stirol Background Company Data Stirol is active through five subsidiaries: Stirolchemtrade, which produces and exports products such as liquid nitric fertilisers, ammonia, urea and ammonium nitrate; Stirolchembyt, which produces and sells enamels, paints, acrylic mixtures and building adhesives; Stirol Biopharm, which produces pharmaceutical products; JSC Stirol Pack, which produces consumer goods, PS and PE products; and Stirol IT, which deals in software development and repair and selling of computer hardware. By the end of 2006, five production units had been set up, including a foamed PS facility. The PS facility has led to an increase in capacity to 50,000tpa. Stirol stopped its ammonia-producing workshop to conduct major repair work owing to a breakdown that took place on September 11 2006. In 2007, Stirols export of urea grew by 23%, urea-ammonia solutions by 221%, PS by 35%, sodium nitrate by 38%, sodium nitrite by 5% and amino resins by 52%.

Source: ILO, BMI Table: Average Annual Wages, 2000-2012 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 BMIs industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variables own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variables own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historic data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Plant Capacity The ability of a country to produce basic chemical products depends on domestic plant capacity. The number and size of ethylene crackers determines both a countrys likely output, and also its relative efficiency as a producer. We therefore examine: Stated year-end capacity for key petrochemicals products, mainly ethylene, but also propylene, polypropylene, polyethylene and so forth. Government, company and third-party sources are used; Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts Chemicals And Petrochemicals Industry Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 Specific company and/or government capacity expansion projects aimed at increasing the number and/or size of crackers and downstream processing facilities. Chemicals Supply A mixture of methods is used to generate supply forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Basic plant capacity and historic utilisation rates. Unless a company imports chemicals products for domestic re-sale, supply is expected to be governed by production capacity; Underlying economic growth trends. The chemicals industry is highly cyclical. Strong domestic or regional demand should be met by increased supply and higher plant utilisation rates; Third-party projections from national and international industry trade associations. Chemicals Demand Various methods are used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Underlying economic growth trends. The chemicals industry is highly cyclical. Strong domestic or regional demand is expected to require larger volumes of either domestically produced or imported olefins , polyolefins or downstream products; Trends in end-user industries. Strong demand for motor vehicles, construction materials, packaging products and pharmaceuticals imply rising demand for basic chemicals; Government/industry projections; Third-party forecasts from national and international industry trade associations etc. Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third party agency projections with the reported spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data, such as physical spending patterns ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the chemicals balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Cross Checks Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q4 2009 BMIs Petrochemicals Business Environment Rating has three objectives. First, we have defined the risks rated in order to accurately capture the operational dangers to companies operating in this industry globally. Second, we have, where possible, identified objective indicators. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a nuanced manner in order to ensure that only the aspects most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the ratings system which integrates with those of all industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the ratings system divides into two distinct areas, with the indicators included in each area stated below: Limits Of Potential Returns Evaluation of sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development. Risks To Realisation Of Returns Evaluation of industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of anticipated returns being realised over the assessed time period. Indicators The following indicators have been used. Overall, the rating uses three subjectively measured indicators, and 41separate indicators/datasets.

""Usually the implementation of IMF programs acts as a catalyst for additional financing. We hope that other donors, including Russia, will be offering more active financial assistance to Belarus,"" Koliadina told Interfax on June 30. ""The authorities in Belarus have demonstrated to the whole world their readiness and ability to stand by their commitments. The Executive Board meeting was attended by country directors from all the 185 countries belonging to the IMF. All of them supported the steps taken by the government and National Bank of Belarus and also the measures that the authorities plan to take in the future in line with their letter of intent, Koliadina said, commenting on the decision of the IMF Executive Board on June 29 to complete the first review of the stand-by loan program and increasing its size for Belarus by $1 billion to $3billion. ""This is gives confidence that the standby program work well and that there is an chance that foreign financing will grow,"" she added. The expansion of the involvement of other donors will largely depend on the future implementation of the program, Koliadina said. ""It was just the first review. If the following reviews are also successful, foreign financing will become more accessible,"" she said.

baa6daca-a031-4e6b-a9cf-d9cb603e27be,"Introduction On 12 August 2008, Georgia filed an Application instituting proceedings against the Russian Federation for violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966 . On 14 August, referring to Article 41 of the Statute of the Court and to Articles 73, 74 and 75 of the Rules of Court, Georgia submitted a Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures in order to preserve its rights under CERD 'to protect its citizens against violent discriminatory acts by Russian armed forces, acting in concert with separatist militia and foreign mercenaries', including unlawful attacks against civilians and civilian objects, murder, forced displacement, denial of humanitarian assistance, and extensive pillage and destruction of towns and villages, in South Ossetia and neighbouring regions of Georgia, and in Abkhazia and neighbouring regions, under Russian occupation. On 25 August, referring to 'the rapidly changing circumstances in Abkhazia and South Ossetia', Georgia submitted an Amended Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures of Protection in order to prevent irreparable harm both to the rights of ethnic Georgians under Articles 2 and 5 of CERD to be secure in their persons and to be protected against violence or bodily harm in the areas of Georgian territory under the effective control of the Russian Federation, and also to prevent irreparable injury to the right of return of ethnic Georgians under Article 5 of CERD, pending the Court's determination of the case on the merits. Public hearings were held from 8 to 10 September in the presence of both parties. The Court delivered its Order on 15 October. The essence of Georgia's claim was that: the Russian Federation, acting through its organs, agents, persons and entities exercising elements of governmental authority, and through South Ossetian and Abkhaz separatist forces under its direction and control, has practised, sponsored and supported racial discrimination through attacks against, and mass-expulsion of, ethnic Georgians, as well as other ethnic groups, in the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of the Republic of Georgia; the Russian Federation seeks to consolidate changes in the entire ethnic composition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia resulting from its actions by preventing the return to South Ossetia and Abkhazia of forcibly displaced ethnic Georgian citizens and by undermining Georgia's capacity to exercise jurisdiction in this part of its territory; and he changed demographic situation in South Ossetia and Abkhazia is intended to provide the foundation for the unlawful assertion of independence from Georgia by the de facto South Ossetian and Abkhaz separatist authorities.' 1 B. Jurisdiction The Court commenced its consideration of the jurisdictional issues by remarking that on a request for the indication of provisional measures, the Court need not finally satisfy itself, before deciding whether or not to indicate such measures, that it had jurisdiction on the merits of the case, but it may not indicate them unless the provisions invoked by the Applicant appear, prima facie, to afford a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court might be founded. 2 At this stage of the proceedings, Georgia sought to found the jurisdiction of the Court solely on the compromissory clause contained in Article 22 of CERD. 3 Thus the Court had to proceed to an examination of Article 22 of CERD to determine if it provided a prima facie basis for jurisdiction to rule on the merits such as would permit the Court, if it considered that the circumstances so warranted, to indicate provisional measures. 4 Article 22 of CERD provides that: Any dispute between two or more State Parties with respect to the interpretation or application of this Convention, which is not settled by negotiation or by the procedures expressly provided for in this Convention, shall, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the International Court of Justice for decision, unless the disputants agree to another mode of settlement. Both Georgia and the Russian Federation are parties to CERD; Georgia deposited its instrument of accession on 2 June 1999 without reservation; the USSR deposited its instrument of ratification on 4 February 1969 with a reservation to Article 22; by a communication received by the Secretary-General of the UN as depositary on 8 March 1989, the Government of the USSR notified the Secretary-General that it had decided to withdraw its reservation relating to article 22; accordingly, the Russian Federation, as the State continuing legal personality of the USSR, is a party to CERD without reservation. After reciting in full the texts of Articles 1 , and Articles 2 and 5 , particular violations of which were invoked by Georgia in the present proceedings, the Court proceeded to deal with the first disputed issue of the territorial application of CERD. Georgia claimed that CERD does not include any limitation on its territorial application and that accordingly, 'Russia's obligations under extend to acts and omissions attributable to Russia which have their locus within Georgia's territory and in particular in Abkhazia and South Ossetia'. By contrast, the Russian Federation claimed that the provisions of CERD could not be applied extraterritorially, and that in particular Articles 2 and 5 of CERD cannot govern a State's conduct outside its own borders. 5 In a remarkably brief statement, the Court observed that there was no restriction of a general nature in CERD relating to its territorial application. Furthermore, it noted that neither Articles 2 nor 5 of CERD contain a specific territorial limitation. Accordingly, the Court found that these provisions of CERD appear to apply, like other provisions of that nature, to the actions of a State party when it acts beyond its territory. 6 Interestingly, the Joint Dissenting Opinion by Vice-President Al-Khasawneh and Judges Ranjeva, Shi, Koroma, Tomka, Bennouna and Scotnikov, was completely silent on this point, presumably indicating concurrence with the view of the Court. This articulation by the Court of the extra-territorial application of CERD is rather under-developed and lacks a certain amount of detailed analysis. In addition, it seems to ignore the structural differences between 'general' international human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights and 'issue-specific' human rights treaties such as CERD dealing with race discrimination. The nature of the two types of treaty is entirely different. It is true that Articles 2 and 5 of CERD contain no territorial limitation. However, Article 3 states expressly that 'States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction'. The clear limitation to territorial jurisdiction established in this article is a reflection of the appreciation of the drafters of this Convention that a State can only prevent acts of racial discrimination within its own domestic territory, assuming that such territory is under its control. The more limited nature of a 'specific' human rights treaty warranted a more limited application. It must be remembered also that this was the first of the major international human rights treaties subsequent to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Given the historical setting of CERD, it is rather unlikely that the drafters were contemplating anything other than a strictly territorial jurisdiction. Indeed, there is nothing in the travaux préparatoires of CERD to indicate that the drafters intended the document to impose obligations on States parties to prevent racial discrimination anywhere outside their territorial jurisdiction. Of course, the same could be said about the converse situation, as the Court itself argued. However, a general reading of the debates as a whole provides a sense that the overall thrust of the discussions related only to the intra-territorial prohibition of discrimination. By contrast, there is no explicit reference to any possibility of the Convention having extra-territorial effect. The reason is apparent: the drafters did not even envisage such a possibility. Indeed, there are frequent references to the eradication by States parties of practices taking place 'in the territories subject to their jurisdiction'. 7 Overall, it is plain that the drafters had in mind each State's responsibility to enforce, and adhere to, the Conventional norms within its own borders. This interpretation is supported by the background to the adoption of CERD. The Convention was adopted in a response to a proliferation of wanton acts of 'swastika-daubing' and 'other manifestations of anti-Semitism and other forms of racial and national hatred and religious and racial prejudices of a similar nature' which occurred in many countries during the winter of 1959-60. 8 It is manifest that States can take effective action only in their own territories to eliminate such evils. Furthermore, in its General Recommendations, the Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination has consistently used expressions which highlight the strictly territorial nature of the obligations: 'on whose territories' and 'in their respective territories' in General Recommendation No II; 9 'all persons living in a given State' in General Recommendation No XX; 10 and, 'on the presence within their territory' and 'on their territory' in General Recommendation XXIV. 11 It is submitted that it was not intended that CERD should apply extra-territorially. The second jurisdictional issue was whether there existed a dispute within the meaning of Article 22 of CERD. Georgia alleged that: events in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have involved racial discrimination of ethnic Georgians living in these regions in violation of the provisions of Articles 2 and 5 of CERD; displaced ethnic Georgians who have been expelled from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, have not been permitted to return to their place of residence in contravention of Article 5 of CERD; and ethnic Georgians have been subject to violent attacks in South Ossetia since the ceasefire on 10 August in breach of Article 5 of CERD. By contrast, the Russian Federation asserted that the facts related exclusively to the use of force, humanitarian law and territorial integrity, and therefore did not fall within the scope of CERD. 12 Thus, there was a difference of opinion between the parties on the issue of whether the events which occurred in South Ossetia and Abkhazia gave rise to legal rights and obligations under CERD. The Court had to determine prima facie whether such a dispute existed. 13 The Court held that as the Parties disagreed on the applicability of Articles 2 and 5 of CERD in the context of events in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, there consequently appeared to be a dispute between them as to the interpretation and application of CERD. Furthermore, the acts alleged to have occurred by Georgia, appeared capable of contravening rights provided for by CERD, even if certain of these alleged acts might be covered also by other rules of international law, including humanitarian law. Accordingly at this stage, that was enough to establish the existence of a dispute between the parties capable of falling within the provisions of CERD, a necessary prerequisite for the Court to have prima facie jurisdiction under Article 22 of CERD. 14 The Joint Dissenting Opinion challenged the finding of the Court on this issue. The Opinion articulates the perfectly orthodox view that a dispute must exist prior to the seisin of the Court. First, the dissenting judges asked the question whether: 'the violent acts which Georgia imputes to Russia likely to ""com within the provisions"" of CERD, to reprise the terminology which the Court employed to decline jurisdiction prima facie in its Order of 2 June 1999 on the Legality of Use of Force Order of 2 June 1999, ICJ Reports 1999 138, para 41)?' The Opinion argued that Russia's armed activities after 8 August could not, in and of themselves, constitute acts of racial discrimination in the sense of Article 1 of CERD unless it was proven that they were aimed at establishing a 'distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin'. It was argued that the circumstances of the armed confrontation arising on 7/8 August were such that this could not be the case, and that it was difficult to consider that the armed acts in question, in and of themselves, and whether committed by Russia and Georgia, fell within the provisions of CERD. 15 Why the need for the ' aim ' of establishing racially based discrimination is relevant is not immediately apparent. Whether or not these acts had this ' aim ' is surely immaterial, if the acts indeed had the effects alleged of widespread breaches of CERD? Similarly, the armed acts may not 'in and of themselves' fall within the terms of CERD, but their consequences did. Secondly, the Joint Dissenting Opinion criticized the Court for concluding that a dispute appeared to exist as to the interpretation and applicability of CERD because the opposing Parties had manifested a disagreement over the applicability of Articles 2 and 5 of the Convention; the dissentients considered that this elevated an argument expounded during oral proceedings into evidence of a dispute between the Parties. 16 Surely, the whole point about pleadings, whether oral or written, is to ensure that a dispute has crystallized between the opposing Parties? And, this is exactly what happened here: thus, a dispute did exist. Thirdly, the Joint Dissenting Opinion criticized the assertion by the Court that 'the acts alleged by Georgia appear to be capable of contravening rights provided for by CERD, even if certain of these alleged acts might also be covered by other rules of international law, including humanitarian law'. 17 The basis of the criticism is unclear. If it is meant to suggest an artificial water tight division between international human rights law and humanitarian law, it is plainly misconceived. In sum, the arguments advanced by the Joint Dissenting Opinion lack convincing reasoning. It is asserted that the Court was right to find that a 'dispute' existed as to the application of interpretation of provisions of CERD. The third disputed issue between the Parties was whether the procedural conditions laid down in article 22 had been satisfied; the Court needed to ascertain the fulfilment of these conditions before deciding if it had prima facie jurisdiction to deal with the case, and accordingly, also had the power to indicate provisional measures if it found that the circumstances so required. Article 22 provides that a dispute relating to the interpretation or application of CERD may be referred to the Court if it 'is not settled by negotiation or by the procedure expressly provided for in this Convention'. Georgia claimed that 'this phrase was descriptive of the fact that that a dispute has not so been settled and does not represent conditions to be exhausted before the Court can be seized of the dispute'. In addition, Georgia claimed that 'bilateral discussions and negotiations relating to the issues which form the subject matter of the Convention have been held between the Parties'. For its part, the Russian Federation submitted that: 'pursuant to Article 22 of CERD, prior negotiations or recourse to the procedures under CERD constitute an indispensable precondition for the seisin of the Court'; no negotiations had been held between the parties on issues relating to CERD; and nor had Georgia brought any such issues to the attention of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in accordance with the procedures envisaged in CERD. 18 The Court observed that: the structure of Article 22 of CERD was not identical to that in certain other instruments which required that a period of time should have elapsed or that arbitration should have been attempted before initiation of proceedings before the Court; the phrase 'any dispute ... which is not settled by negotiation or by the procedure expressly provided for in this Convention' did not, on its plain meaning, suggest that formal negotiations in the framework of the Convention or recourse to the procedure referred to in Article 22 of CERD constitute preconditions to be fulfilled before the seisin of the Court; however, Article 22 suggested that some attempt should have been made by the claimant party to initiate with the respondent party, discussions on issues that would fall under CERD; it was clear from the case file that such issues had been raised in bilateral contacts between the parties, and, that these issues had not been resolved by negotiation prior to filing of the Application; that in several representations to the UN Security Council in the days before the filing of the Application, those same issues were raised by Georgia and commented upon by the Russian Federation; accordingly, the Russian Federation was made aware of Georgia's position in that regard; the fact that CERD had not been mentioned specifically in a bilateral or multilateral context was not an obstacle to the seisin of the Court under Article 22 of CERD; and neither Party claimed that the dispute had been brought to the attention of the Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination under the inter-State procedure detailed in Articles 11-13. 19 The Joint Dissenting Opinion dismissed the interpretation of the Court detailed in point above on the issue of whether it had not been settled by 'negotiation'. First, the Opinion remarked that the Court's interpretation would amount to denying any useful scope to the provision for 'negotiation' in Article 22 of CERD. Secondly, the Opinion remarked that although the Court had referred to bilateral contacts between the Parties and certain representations made to the Security Council, nowhere in these had Georgia accused Russia of racial discrimination. Thirdly, the Opinion suggested that 'for the condition of prior negotiation to be fulfilled, it suffices for an attempt to have been made and for it to have become clear at some point that there was no chance of success. In any event, it is clear that when negotiation is expressly provided for by a treaty, the Court cannot ignore this prior condition without explanation; nor can the Court dispose of this condition merely by observing that the question has not been resolved by negotiation'. 20 In substance, the Joint Dissenting Opinion argues that the Court at least should have asked itself whether negotiations had been opened and whether they were likely to yield a result, but it did not do so. It is suggested that in fact the Court broadly adopted this approach in its articulation in point above, without perhaps expressly stating that the dispute had reached the point where it obviously could not be settled by negotiation. The Joint Dissenting Opinion considered next whether the alternative criterion in Article 22 of CERD had been satisfied: that the dispute had not been settled by 'the procedures expressly provided for in this Convention'. The Opinion rejected the Court's summary disposal of the issue characterizing it as 'puzzling', because it neither accepted the ordinary meaning of Article 22 nor its object and purpose which was to encourage the maximum number of States Parties to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, with the assurance that the procedures provided for in the Convention would be exhausted first. Neither did the Court's interpretation refer to the travaux préparatoires for this Article drafted by the Third Committee of the General Assembly. The Opinion also made the point that the Court could have considered that the gravity of the situation when armed conflict erupted on 7/8 August did not allow for resort to these procedures, but remarked that that would have shown little confidence in the rapid response procedure developed by the Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 1993 to allow it to intervene quickly and effectively in cases of possible violations of the Convention. 21 This writer has considerable sympathy with the view that the point of Article 22 was to ensure the exhaustion of both negotiation and all internal to CERD methods of dispute resolution before a referral to the Court. However, it seems clear now that this interpretation may have been flawed. Neither the Court nor the Joint Dissenting Opinion refers to Article 16 of the Convention. This is a pity as it seems to hold the key to unlocking the correct interpretation of Article 22. Article 16 is worth setting out in full. It reads: The provisions of this Convention concerning the settlement of disputes or complaints shall be applied without prejudice to other procedures for settling disputes or complaints in the field of discrimination laid down in the constituent instruments of, or in conventions adopted by, the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and shall not prevent the States Parties from having recourse to other procedures for settling a dispute in accordance with general or special international agreements in force between them. The final clause of this provision is sufficiently wide and elastic to suggest that exhaustion of the intra-treaty procedure specified in Article 22 is not a prerequisite of referral to the Court for resolution. Thus, it seems that the Court reached the right decision on this issue, albeit for a different reason. Having disposed of all the objections to jurisdiction, the Court considered that prima facie it had jurisdiction under Article 22 of CERD to deal with the case to the extent that the subject-matter of the dispute related to the 'interpretation or application' of CERD. Thus, the Court could proceed to address the Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures. Provisional Measures Order The Court began its consideration of this issue by articulating three basic principles underlying the indication of provisional measures. First, the power of the Court to indicate provisional measures under Article 41 of the Statute of the Court has as its object the preservation of the respective rights of the parties pending the decision of the Court, in order to ensure that irreparable prejudice shall not be caused to rights which are the subject of dispute in judicial proceedings. 23 Secondly, it follows that the Court must be concerned to preserve by such measures the rights which may subsequently be adjudged to belong to either the Applicant or Respondent. 24 Thirdly, therefore, a link must be established between the alleged rights, the protection of which is the subject of the provisional measures being sought, and the subject of the proceedings before the Court on the merits of the case. 25 After consideration of the arguments of the Parties, the Court noted that Articles 2 and 5 of CERD are intended to protect individuals from racial discrimination by obliging States parties to undertake certain measures specified therein. 26 Furthermore, States parties to CERD had the right to demand compliance by a State party with specific obligations incumbent upon it pursuant to those provisions. Accordingly, there was a correlation between respect for individual rights, the obligations of States parties under CERD, and the right of States parties to seek compliance therewith. The Court concluded that the rights which Georgia invoked in, and sought to protect by, its Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures had a sufficient connection with the merits of the case it had brought, for the purposes of the present proceedings. Consequently, the Court considered that its attention must be focussed now upon the rights thus claimed in its consideration of Georgia's request for the indication of provisional measures. 27 Having established the existence of the basis on which its jurisdiction might be founded, the Court warned that it ought not to indicate measures for the protection of any disputed rights other than those which might ultimately form the basis of a judgment in the exercise of that jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court resolved to confine its examination of the measures requested by Georgia, and of the grounds asserted for the request for such measures, to those which appear to fall within the scope of CERD. 28 Since the power of the Court to indicate provisional measures could be exercised only if there was 'urgency' in the sense that there was a real risk that action prejudicial to the rights of either party might be taken prior to the Court's final decision, 29 the Court had to consider also whether such 'urgency' existed in the current proceedings. On the issues of 'irreparable prejudice' and 'urgency' Georgia argued that the conduct of the Russian Federation in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and adjacent regions necessitated the urgent indication of provisional measures because ethnic Georgians in those areas were 'at imminent risk of violent expulsion, death or personal injury, hostage-taking and unlawful detention, and damage to or loss of their homes and other property' and 'in addition, the prospects for the return of those ethnic Georgians who already been forced to flee rapidly deteriorating'. 30 Georgia introduced evidence to support these claims from the reports of international and non-governmental organizations and witness statements, purporting to show the 'on-going, widespread and systematic abuses of rights of ethnic Georgians under the Convention' in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and other parts of Georgia occupied then by Russian forces. 31 Georgia claimed that 'the widespread violations of the rights of ethnic Georgians under the Convention grew even worse after military engagements ceased, that they have continued unabated since then, and that they are continuing still'. 32 Georgia claimed that 'the risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights at issue in this case is not only imminent already happening'. 33 In rebuttal, the Russian Federation claimed that the criteria of Article 41 were not met in the instant case and that Georgia had not established that any rights against Russia under Articles 2 and 5 of CERD were exposed to 'serious risk' of irreparable damage. In support, the Russian Federation pointed to: the statements of Georgian Ministers, decisions and international agreements to which Georgia is a party, in which its role and the role of its peacekeeping forces are consented to and recognized as beneficial in the period characterised by Georgia as the 'first and second phases of Russia's intervention in South Ossetia and Abkhazia'; that the facts that can be relied upon with reasonable certainty militate against the existence of a serious risk to the rights pleaded by Georgia because, first, deaths and mass displacements of persons of all ethnicities had taken place, and secondly, because since the cessation of hostilities, civilians of all ethnicities were returning to some of the conflict zones; in addition the Russian Foreign Minister in discussions with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on 15 August agreed on the principle of the non-discriminatory nature of the right of return for all civilians forced to flee; that the issue of 'urgency' could be established only on events subsequent to 7 August as before that date Georgia had never raised violations of CERD with Russia; events subsequent to that date did not support an 'urgent' situation: the ceasefire came into effect on 12 August, and the six principles for the peaceful settlement of the conflict had been adopted by the Presidents of Russia and France on the same day, and signed on 13-16 August 2008 by the President of Georgia and the leaders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the presence of the OSCE and the EU, thus terminating all armed actions; 'the case on urgency in relation to Abkhazia built almost exclusively on inference, and that not a sound basis for a provisional measures award'; and a number of other initiatives were being taken at the highest levels to deal precisely with the problem put before the Court: from 8 September EU monitors were deployed into the buffer zones around South Ossetia and Abkhazia; Russian peace keeping troops would withdraw 10 days later; UN and OSCE observers would carry out their mandates; the issues of security, stability and refugees were being discussed at the highest political levels; in short, there was no ongoing worsening crisis. 34 Before addressing the issues of 'irreparable prejudice' and 'urgency' the Court explained that: it was not called upon, for the purpose of its decision on the Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures, to establish the existence of breaches of CERD, but to determine whether the circumstances require the indication of provisional measures for the protection of rights under CERD; it could not at this stage make definitive findings of fact nor finding of attribution; and the right of each Party to submit arguments in respect of the merits remained unaffected by the Court's decision on the Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures. 35 On these issues, the Court asserted that the rights in question in these proceedings, in particular those stipulated in Article 5 and of CERD are of such a nature that prejudice to them could be irreparable in three senses: violations of the right to security of person and of the right to protection by the State against violence or bodily harm (Article 5 ) could involve potential loss of life or bodily injury and could therefore cause irreparable prejudice; violations of the right to freedom of movement and residence within a State's borders (Article 5 ) could also cause irreparable prejudice in situations where the persons concerned are exposed to privation, hardship, anguish and even danger to life and health; and individuals forced to leave their own place of residence and deprived of their right to return could, depending on the circumstances, be subject to a serious risk of irreparable prejudice. 36 The Court then indicated the importance of assessing contemporary conditions in this context: the exceptional and complex situation on the ground in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and adjacent areas together with uncertainties as to where the lines of authority lay. The Court then extended several considerations that affected its decision on these issues: the ethnic Georgian population in the areas affected by the recent conflict remained vulnerable; the situation in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and the adjacent areas in Georgia was unstable and could change rapidly; given the on going tension and in the absence of an overall settlement to the conflict in this region, ethnic Ossetian and Abkhazian populations remained vulnerable also; the problem of refugees and internally displaced persons in the region was being addressed presently, but were not completely resolved; and in the light of the above factors, there remained an imminent risk that the rights in issue in this case (Articles 5 and ) might suffer irreparable prejudice in respect of the various ethnic groups . 37 The Court was thus able to conclude that it was satisfied that the indication of measures was required for the protection of rights under CERD. However, the Court remarked that it had the power under its Statute, on a request for provisional measures, to indicate measures that were in whole or partly other than those requested, or measures that were addressed to the party which itself had made the request. The Court pointed out that Article 75 of the Rules of Court refers expressly to this power of the Court, and that the Court had exercised this power already on several previous occasions. 38 Having found that that the indication of provisional measures was required in the current proceedings, the Court considered the terms of the provisional measures requested by Georgia. The Court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the measures to be indicated were not identical to those requested by Georgia: in particular, the Court considered it appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to indicate measures addressed to both parties. 39 Finally, before indicating the precise provisional measures, the Court reminded that the Court's orders on provisional measures under Article 41 of the have binding effect. 40 Accordingly, such orders create international legal obligations with which both parties are required to comply. 41 The Joint Dissenting Opinion denied that the first necessary condition of 'irreparable harm' existed even if prima facie jurisdiction were established. The Opinion remarks that: nowhere does the Court demonstrate the existence of any risk of 'irreparable harm' to Georgia's rights under CERD; referring to the statement in the Order of the Court that 'the rights in question in these proceedings ... are of such nature that prejudice to them could be irreparable' , the Opinion declares that this 'appears to suggest that certain rights may automatically fulfil the irreparable harm criterion, without analysing the real facts on the ground or the actual threat against the said rights'; 42 with regard to the 'expulsions', they could not in and of themselves be considered to constitute 'irreparable harm', since the Court, if it arrived at the merits stage of the case, could always order that the expelled individuals be allowed to return to their homes and be granted appropriate compensation; and it was even harder to claim that 'irreparable harm' to the rights in dispute when the appropriate organs of the UN had reported that thousands of persons had returned to their homes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and when the ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008 provided that negotiations would begin soon in Geneva on 15 October 2008 between the parties in respect, inter alia, of the progressive return of displaced persons. 43 This criticism of the dissenting judges is not altogether convincing as it is not thought that the Court was categorizing certain rights as satisfying automatically the 'irreparable harm' criterion, but actually specifying concretely that in cases of death or personal injury such a criterion would be satisfied. Nor was the Court stating that in cases of 'expulsions' that would satisfy the criterion automatically per se; it explained that in the case of 'expulsions', this could also result in danger to life or bodily injury. The Joint Dissenting Opinion dismisses peremptorily the second necessary condition of 'urgency' found by the Court. The Opinion states quite categorically that there was no situation of 'urgency' because after the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement and the return of troops of both countries to their positions before 7 August 2008, EU observers had been deployed to monitor the ceasefire and observers from the UN Mission in Georgia and those from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe would continue with their missions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is suggested that these considerations for denying the 'urgency' of the situation simply fail to take account of the reality of the situation on the ground, where all ethnic groups continued to be under threat of violence and expulsion from their homes at the hands of various armed militia for an indefinite period of time after the ceasefire. In any event, the OSCE observers were withdrawn by 23 December 2008 after Russia rejected plans to extend its mandate. Furthermore, it is manifest that the reality is that internally displaced ethnic Georgians are extremely unlikely to return to their homes in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, irrespective of any possibility of compensation. Indeed, of the $4billion pledged by international donors to help re-build Georgian infrastructure at a conference at Brussels on 22 October 2008, the UN and World Bank have estimated that Georgia would need $3billion over the next three years to help the tens of thousands forced to flee from their own homes and to repair infrastructure. 44 In sum, the evidence of all official and media reports is that the situation was still extremely volatile and dangerous at the moment of the Court's delivery of its Provisional Measures Order. As such, it would seem that the criterion of 'urgency' was satisfied. The Order of the Court By a majority of eight votes to seven in each case 45 , the Court indicated the following provisional measures: Both Parties, within South Ossetia and Abkhazia and adjacent areas in Georgia, shall: refrain from any act of racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions; abstain from sponsoring, defending or supporting racial discrimination by any persons or organisations; do all in their power, whenever and wherever possible, to ensure, without distinction as to national or ethnic origin security of persons; the right of persons to freedom of movement and residence within the border of the State; the protection of the property of displaced persons and of refugees; do all in their power to ensure that public authorities and public institutions under their control or influence do not engage in acts of racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions; Both parties shall facilitate, and refrain from placing any impediment to, humanitarian assistance in support of the rights to which the local population are entitled under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; Each Party shall refrain from any action which might prejudice the rights of the other party in respect of whatever judgment the Court may render in the case, or which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve; Each party shall inform the Court as to its compliance with the above provisional measures. Conclusions Despite the arguments advanced in the Joint Dissenting Opinion, generally the Court's findings on the issues in dispute between the Parties are fairly uncontroversial. It might have been thought that the reference in Article 22 to 'procedures expressly provided for in this Covenant' imposed a pre-condition which had to be fulfilled before the seisin of the Court. Indeed, that was the view until recently of this author himself. However, it appears that the terms of Article 16 are sufficiently wide and flexible to outflank this perceived limitation on the seisin of the Court. The major, central finding by the Court of the extra-territorial application of CERD is much harder to justify either textually or by the practice of States parties to CERD. Doubtless the Court was motivated for the laudable objective of saving lives in making this finding. One can imagine easily a Court composed of judges such as President Higgins and Judges Buergenthal and Simma with their powerful and substantial human rights law expertise coming to such a conclusion. Nevertheless, the jurisprudential justification was uncertain. However, it may be true to say that in this case the end pragmatic objective of saving lives justified the means. 7 For example: UN Doc A/6181, Report of the Third Committee, Annexes, Vol III, , 20 th Session, p 15; at p 20 of this report the words 'subject to their jurisdiction' were replaced by 'under their jurisdiction' following a proposal by a number of States , presumably to emphasise the territorial nature of the obligations undertaken.

8a22aaa5-14c0-4055-bcb3-b156d2a9f5bc,"In present-day Russia, just as in the former Soviet Union, there are a number of bodies involved in shaping the state's foreign policy, and the decision-making process in this area is still determined by informal factors rather than by the law in force. Although today a majority of state governance institutions are under direct control of the president, who, formally, is responsible for the foreign policy of Russia, effective coordination mechanisms regulating the scope of their respective powers are lacking. The situation is additionally complicated by an absence of clear political leadership after 2008. Although under the Russian Constitution the president plays the most important role in the political system of the state, Vladimir Putin, who stepped down after eight years at this post, remains the actual leader of Russia in the eyes of a majority of Russian citizens. Upon completing his term as president, he became the head of government and the leader of the largest party in Parliament, One Russia, and it was thanks to his support that his former long-time subordinate Dmitry Medvedev was elected the new president. Since 2008 foreign policy has been in both President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin's orbit of special interest. This is evidenced, among other things, by both politicians' numerous trips abroad and by talks on international issues they have been conducting with comparable frequency. The Russian authorities' reaction to the Smolensk tragedy of 10 April 2010 was another example of their equal involvement in foreign affairs: both President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin issued messages to the Polish nation and made a number of other gestures to manifest solidarity with the Poles. This comparable international activity of the president and the prime minister means that-alongside the presidential administration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which report directly to the head of the state-the apparatus of the head of government has become an important body in adopting decisions with respect to Russia's foreign policyThis increased significance of the government center traditionally focused on socio-economic policy could lead to a polarization of the power elite's positions on Russia's role in international economic relations. This paper analyzes the decision-making process with respect to Russia's foreign policy. To this end, it begins with a review of the mechanisms responsible for the shape of Soviet foreign policy, proceeding to the legal division of powers and responsibilities in directing and implementing the external policy of post-Soviet Russia; finally, it addresses present-day political practice in this area. The concluding section provides an assessment of the efforts made to date to put foreign policy coordination mechanisms in place as well as a forecast of the evolution of the decision-making system in Russia. Decision-making Process in the Foreign Policy of the Soviet Union It was a peculiarity of the Soviet system, one which prevailed almost throughout the entire lifetime of the USSR, that real executive power was separated from the purely ornamental representative powerThe latter, formally superior to the executive branch, was in practice totally subordinated thereto. This was determined not by political practice alone, but also by legal arrangements in effect-including those that restricted the nomination of candidates to representative bodies, or extended periods between sessions of the latter. This peculiar division into ornamental and real power applied to party and state bodies alike. In the communist party supreme representative power was vested in the party congress and in the Central Committee , and executive power-in the ""CC apparatus,"" notably the Central Committee Politburo and the CC Secretariat with diverse CC departments. The party's charter pronounced ""the party congress the supreme body of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"" , to be convened at least once in four yearsThe Congress elected the Central Committee to direct all activities of the party between congresses and to hold plenary meetings at least once every six months CC members convened ""in plenum"" elected members of the Secretariat and the Politburo to control, respectively, ""day-to-day work, chiefly in organizing supervision over the implementation of party resolutions and the selection of cadres"" and ""the work of the CC between plenary meetings"" The people in charge of the work of the Politburo, Secretariat and different CC departments exercised real power in the party. A similar division was in effect in state institutions. The last Soviet Constitution proclaimed: ""All power in the USSR belongs to people"" who ""exercise state power through Soviets of People's Deputies"" Furthermore, under the 1977 fundamental law, the Supreme Council of the USSR was ""the supreme body of state power in the USSR"" , it was to be convened at least twice a year , and it consisted of two chambers: the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities . At a joint sitting the two chambers elected the Presidium, i.e. ""a standing body of the Supreme Council accountable to it for all its work and exercising, between sessions of the Supreme Council, the function of the highest body of state authority of the USSR"" . The Presidium of the Supreme Council was vested with broad legislative and executive powers . Together with the Council of Ministers as the highest executive authority , it exercised real state power. Doubtless, in reality the Council of Ministers and the Presidium of the Supreme Council were both accountable to the communist party rather than to the Soviet Parliament. The work of the different ministries was supervised by respective CC departments, which in turn were overseen by the Secretariat, with all major decisions requiring the approval of the PolitburoWhile this duplication of government work by the party apparatus certainly hampered the cabinet's effective performance,8 it enabled a select nomenklatura hierarchy to be established embracing state and party institutions alikeIn practice, the secretary general of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , who was responsible for the work of the CC Secretariat and chaired Politburo debates, held the top position in the Soviet decision-making system. As a rule at weekly Politburo meetings proposals put on the table by the CC secretary general were unanimously approved. Rarely would a vote be ordered -a practice designed to avoid the disclosure of intra-party divisions. Agreement would be reached before the meeting, through behind-the-scenes play for influence on the work of the Secretariat and various CC departmentsThe players were high-ranking members of party-and-state nomenklatura, since the Politburo comprised also representatives of state authorities, notably the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Council The official division of powers and responsibilities between the party administration and the state administration with respect to shaping the foreign policy of the Soviet Union was enshrined in the 1977 Constitution. Under Article 131of the fundamental law, the Council of Ministers of the USSR ""shall exercise general direction in the areas of relations with other states, foreign trade, and economic, scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation of the USSR with other countries; take appropriate measures to ensure fulfillment of the USSR's international treaties; and approve and terminate by notice inter-governmental international agreements.Article 6 of the Constitution provided that ""the Communist Party ... determined the general perspectives of the development of society and the course of the home and foreign policy of the USSR. So important was foreign policy to the Soviet Union leadership that all significant decisions in this area were subject to approval by the Politburo. Two institutions played the main role in developing these: the International Department of the CC CPSU and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSRBesides these two, the remaining CC departments and Union ministries responsible for foreign trade, the defense industry, or for contacts with communist and workers' parties in the socialist countries had much bearing on foreign policy. As a result, the external policy of the USSR was influenced by institutions which had diverse profiles, seldom cooperated, did not agree their positions at earlier stages of the proceedings, and were closed to an exchange of opinion and information. Both the International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were intent on fortifying their respective positions in the Soviet decision-making system. The MFA was expanding its internal and external administration. As for the International Department, while it lacked a developed external apparatus of consular and diplomatic representations, its strength consisted in its direct access to the political leadership of the state. With Andrei Gromyko joining the Politburo in 1973, the MFA gained more say in the decision-making process. That same year Boris Ponomarev, CC secretary and ID chief, was appointed head of a team drafting a new constitution,16 and the provision on the party's dominant role in determining the foreign policy of the USSR was most likely inserted due to his personal involvement. In political practice, disputes between the MFA and the ID were frequent. Former Soviet diplomat Arkadiy Shevchenko attributes this to the fact that the powers and responsibilities of the two structures often overlappedAccording to his account, Andrei Gromyko very often expressed his exasperation with the fact that two coordination centers were functioning in Soviet foreign policy. In addition, there were private animosities between Gromyko and Ponomarev, whose positions were not equivalent. Unlike the Soviet diplomacy chief, Ponomarev had never been a full member of the Politburo, despite the strong support he enjoyed from Mikhail Suslov, one of senior party personages after the death of Joseph Stalin It was in the approach to Third World states that differences between the MFA and the ID were the most noticeableFor the Department, this was the foremost area of interest, since relations with the communist parties in socialistcamp states were handled by a separate department of the CC, and chances of communists coming to power in Western states were negligible. The ID steadfastly supported communist movement activities in numerous states in Asia, Africa and South America, while the MFA's position on similar issues seemed less radical and more international reaction-conscious Changes initiated by Secretary General of CC CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev in the second half of the 1980s put an end to the nearly thirty-years-old cadre-institutional pattern in shaping the foreign policy of the USSR. Eduard Shevardnadze replaced Andrei Gromyko as the MFA head and former Soviet Union Ambassador to Washington Anatoliy Dobrynin took over from Boris Ponomarev the leadership of the ID. Gorbachev also curbed the influence of the military lobby by relieving the Ministry of Defense of the burden of responsibility for the conduct of disarmament negotiations with the United States. In June 1986 he established a special department for arms control and disarmament within the MFA. At the same time, the growing role of advisors from the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Institute for USA and Canada Studies, and the Institute of the Global Economy and International Relations was undermining the position of military personnel Initially Gorbachev had been building up the ID at the expense of the MFA-for instance, by putting the Department in control of the diplomatic corps and expanding its powers and responsibilitiesThis approach of the Soviet leader changed following the launch of political reforms in 1988. Gorbachev had a majority of CC departments disbanded and the remaining ones put under the supervision of special commissions coordinated by CC secretaries. From then onward, international affairs were to be regulated within the party by Aleksandr Yakovlev, chief ideologist of perestroika and a long-time Soviet ambassador to CanadaThe ID's position was utterly marginalized while the MFA came to play the dominant role in charting Soviet foreign policy, chiefly owing to Shevardnadze's support for the reform program. This changed in December 1990, when Shevardnadze accused Gorbachev, who at the same time held the posts of CPSU secretary general and president of the USSR, of dictatorial designs and resigned as minister. By then Gorbachev, intent on preventing the breakup of the state, had resolved to strengthen the central authority 24 and to introduce a more rigorous domestic policy Thenceforth all major foreign policy decisions were taken by the president of the USSR and his closest advisors This centralization drive was countered by the authorities of different republics, with Boris Yeltsin playing the leading role. After Yeltsin's election, in June 1991, to the office of president of the Russian Republic, a new decisionmaking center responsible for foreign affairs emerged in Moscow as a competitor to union authorities. This was evidenced, for instance, by the official reception given to President Boris Yeltsin at the White House in July 1991The failed August 1991 military putsch only sped up the disintegration of the union state, whose institutions no longer played a crucial role in the political process. In the USSR the system of decision-making in the area of foreign policy had developed chiefly on the basis of informal nomenklatura principles rather than rules arising from Soviet legislation. Faced with the deteriorating socioeconomic situation and a crisis of the communist ideology, the state leaders resolved to downgrade the party's actual role as the factor ensuring the cohesion of this system. Yet attempts to replace the demolished nomenklatura order with effective public institutions failed. The system proved to be totally dysfunctional and, to rescue the integrity of the state, the Soviet leadership had to abandon the process of democratization of power-a decision which accelerated the breakdown of the country. Powers of Executive Authorities in the Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation In early years of an independent Russia the 1978 fundamental law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic , revised, was the supreme legislation determining the RSFSR's political system. Under this law the division of powers and responsibilities between the executive and the legislative branch was unclear. In accordance with the Constitution in effect in April 1992, ""the Congress of Peoples' Deputies has the exclusive jurisdiction to ... determine the external and internal policy of the state"" . This implied the Parliament's supreme role in developing the country's policy. Responsible for the implementation of policy was the Council of Ministers, which, ""within its powers, exercises leadership in the area of Russia's relations with foreign states and international organizations"" The Constitution also conferred substantial powers upon the president as ""the head of the executive authority"" who ""directs the work of the Council of Ministers"" . In addition, the powers of the head of state in the area of foreign relations included appointing and recalling diplomatic representatives of the Russian Federation , receiving letters of credence from other states' accredited representatives, conducting negotiations and signing international treaties for Russia The federal services responsible for internal and external security of the country were directly accountable to the president. Also, the president had his own administrative and advisory support services built from the former CC CPSU apparatus. Until the end of 1993 the president and the deputies were in dispute over leadership in shaping the external and internal policy of the state. Both sides were seeking to gain control over the work of the government, whose inflated and intricate structure was one of its weaknesses. In December 1992 the Parliament adopted amendments to the Constitution, making the Council of Ministers accountable not only to the president, but also to the Congress of Peoples' Deputies and the Supreme Council The president, for his part, attempted to create, as an alternative to the Council of Ministers, a platform consisting of the heads of key ministries and federal servicesTo this end, he pushed through in March 1993 a security law which set down in detail the functioning of the Security Council of the RF Within the government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, transformed from the republican MFA in late 1991, was the chief executive authority responsible for the implementation of Russia's external policy. It was headed since October 1990 by Andrei Kozyrev, a champion of democratization of the country and a Boris Yeltsin supporter. The president of Russia decided that the republican MFA, which had been in existence since the end of World War II and whose role had been limited for most of the time to the provision of consular services to Russian citizens,33 was to take over the disbanded Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union and develop a new organizational structure within one monthThe new Ministry took on a larger part of the former staff of the union-level MFA,35 and its interim charter was approved in late FebruaryPresident Yeltsin, who until June 1992 acted also as the prime minister, attempted during that period to make the MFA the main center for coordinating the remaining executive authorities' international activities,37 as it should be borne in mind that at the time there were separate ministries within the government dealing with concrete sections of foreign policy, such as international economic cooperation or relations with the post-Soviet states. The Ministries of Defense, Finance or the Economy also engaged in external matters. The December 1992 agreement between Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Council left the presidential camp worrying lest the deputies would gain more control over the work of the government, which was then headed by Viktor ChernomyrdinTherefore Yeltsin appointed an inter-ministerial commission for foreign policy within the Security Council, a step which seriously undermined the MFA's coordination function. Represented in the commission were the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Security, Internal Affairs, Justice, Foreign Intelligence, International Economic Relations, and Economic Relations with the CIS states, but also the heads of respective parliamentary committees, presidential advisors and the representative of the RF to the UN. The responsibilities of the commission, which was headed by Security Council secretary Yuri Skokov, covered analyzing the international situation, developing a cohesive policy line for Russia's foreign policy, submitting concrete recommendations, and overseeing the process of implementing presidential decisions in this area The appointment of the Security Council's inter-ministerial commission for foreign policy aggravated the discord between the Security Council secretary and the minister of foreign affairs over their respective institutions' roles in drafting and developing Russia's position on international relations issues. That the Security Council secretary had the upper hand became obvious at the turn of 1992, during work on a concept document on the Russian Federation's foreign policyAfter Yuri Skokov's dismissal from the function of Security Council secretary in the spring of 1993, the MFA regained the lead in shaping Russia's external policy. This was reflected in Minister Andrei Kozyrev's appointment, in the summer of 1993, as Special Envoy of the Russian President for Tajikistan, and in the setting up of an inter-ministerial working group attached to the MFA to deal with the problem. After that the MFA was engaged more actively in shaping Russia's policy in the post-Soviet areaThe Security Council's foreign policy commission lost some of its significance and it no longer held regular meetings The legal situation with respect to shaping Russia's foreign policy was largely put in order by the Constitution of 12 December 1993. The Constitution made foreign policy the president's exclusive domain, an arrangement which drew on the tsarist tradition rather than on the heritage of the Soviet system. The legislators decreed that the ""President of the Russian Federation shall define the basic directions of the domestic and foreign policy of the state in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation and federal laws"" and ""direct the foreign policy of the state"" Additional powers and responsibilities of the president covered: representing the state in international relations , conducting negotiations and signing international treaties , appointing and recalling diplomatic representatives of the Russian Federation to foreign states and international organizations , accepting credentials of ambassadors and envoys extraordinary of foreign states , presenting to the Federal Assembly annual messages on the state of the Federation and on the basic directions of the internal and external policies of the state . The fundamental law demonstrably reduced the Parliament's role in shaping the state's foreign policy. The powers of both chambers, the Council of the Federation and the State Duma, cover mainly the ratification and termination by notice of international treaties and the use of armed forces outside the territory of the RFThe legislators point out that the ""federal laws adopted by the State Duma on the ratification of international treaties concluded by the RF and their termination by notice are subject to mandatory consideration by the Council of the Federation . Both chambers may also adopt resolutions on international issues and develop inter-parliamentary cooperation. The Constitution identified the government as the only body to implement Russia's foreign policy: the government ""shall carry out measures to secure the defense of the country, state security, and the implementation of the foreign policy of the Russian Federation"" . The executive powers of the government are restated in the 1997 Federal Act on the Government of the Russian Federation. Under Article 21 of the Act, the government ""shall adopt measures to implement the foreign policy of the RF, ensure representation of the RF in other states and international organizations, conclude international treaties within the scope of its powers, observe international commitments of the RF and oversee fulfillment of the same by the other parties thereto, safeguard the geopolitical interests of Russia, protect citizens of the RF outside the country's borders, regulate foreign economic activity and activity in the area of international scientific-technical and cultural cooperation and establish state supervision over the latter. Two institutions reporting to the head of the state are provided for in the Constitution: the Security Council and the Administration of the President . The fundamental law decrees that the president ""shall form and head the Security Council of the Russian Federation whose status shall be determined by federal law"" and ""shall form the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation"" . The above fragment of the Constitution indicates a stronger position of the Security Council in the constitutional system of the Russian Federation: the Council's status is determined by a federal law passed by Parliament rather than by a presidential decree, as in the case of the AP. On foreign policy-related matters both institutions have similar objectives. One of the main objectives of the AP is to ensure the exercise of the president's leadership function in the foreign policy of the RF and to develop an overall strategy for this policy. The SC's fundamental targets include preparing recommendations for the president to assist him in making decisions on foreign policy matters relating to the security of the state and in determining the main directions of this policy. Furthermore, the president is also in control of the activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with his powers in this regard confirmed both in the Act on the Government and in the Ministry's charter approved by presidential decree in 2004The main duties of the MFA include, besides implementing the state's policy in the area of international relations of the RF, developing an overall strategy for the foreign policy of the RF and submitting relevant proposals to the president 47-tasks that lie also within the powers and responsibilities of the AP and SC. As for shaping the external policy of the RF, the MFA's special position in this decision-making process arises from the Ministry's formal coordination role vis-à-vis the remaining executive bodies The government reform of 2004, designed to simplify and improve the functioning of the federal executive power system, has failed to fully clarify the matter of coordination of the process of conceptualization and implementation of the external policy of the RF. The SC's new charter of 7 June 2004 provides that one of the main functions of the SC is to ""organize and coordinate the development of a strategy for domestic, foreign and defense policies of the RF"" and that the SC secretary ""participates in the development and implementation of the foreign policy line of the RF"" Provisions of the law indicate unequivocally that it is the SC that coordinates the process of developing an overall foreign policy strategy and that the SC secretary participates in developing and implementing the state's foreign policy to an extent determined by the Ministry. The division of powers and responsibilities between the MFA and the SC and its secretary is blurred, and neither is the difference between ""developing an overall strategy"" and ""developing the line"" of the country's foreign policy clearly defined. The SC's coordination function in developing the strategy for Russia's foreign policy is realized through the activities of an inter-ministerial commission for strategic planning. The commission's basic weaknesses are its size and the frequency of its meetings . What is more, the meetings of the commission are chaired by the AP head, while the SC secretary is just a member. This arrangement could spark disputes over powers and responsibilities between the two officials, since the SC secretary coordinates the work of all commissions and approves their outputPresidential aides who advise the head of the state on international issues are not regular commission members. The problem of coordination of the RF's foreign policy is also related to the division of leadership powers between the head of state and the head of government-namely, to control over the different executive bodies . Institutions reporting to the president include the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Emergency Situations. The prime minister controls the Ministries of Economic Development, Finance, Energy, Industry and Trade, i.e. those with an impact on the development of Russia's financial and economic relations with other statesShould differences emerge between the head of state and the head of government on Russia's external relations, this division of powers will exacerbate the lack of cohesion in Russia's foreign policy. As things are, with government meetings presided over by the prime minister rather than the president, the government is formally deprived of the possibility to develop a uniform position on foreign matters. Similarly, the president has no regular influence on day-to-day work of the economic ministries, even though this work increasingly determines Russia's external relations. This pattern puts the MFA in a difficult position: as a body reporting to the president the MFA is required to coordinate the activities of the remaining ministries, with some of them placed under the leadership of the prime minister. This could also aggravate conflicts between the minister of foreign affairs and the head of government or, as the case may be, the head of state, should political differences arise. The 2004 reform of the executive branch also confirmed the president's leadership function vis-à-vis the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Security. Within these structures an important role in shaping the state's foreign policy is played by executive bodies with a capability to carry out operational and analytical activities abroad. Besides the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which reports to the Ministry of Defense, three other civilian services operate outside the national territory: the Foreign Intelligence Service , the Federal Security Service and the Federal Drug Control Service . Of these, the SVR's external activities have the broadest scope. The head of this service, like the FSB chief, is a permanent member of the SC, regularly participating in SC meetings Practice of Shaping Russia's Foreign Policy Representatives of the different executive bodies influence the state's foreign policy not just by virtue of their formal powers and responsibilities. Their position in the decision-making process is determined by a number of factors, such as the size of the institution they head, its position in the bureaucratic hierarchy and-an extremely important asset-free access to the president, who under the Constitution is responsible for the country's foreign policy. The Foreign Ministry's edge over the other ministries is rooted in its developed structures, both external and internal . Moreover, this institution enjoys high prestige deriving from the rich tradition of Russian and Soviet diplomatic service. After the breakup of the Soviet Union there have been fewer replacements in the MFA leadership than in other state institutions. In nearly 20 years the Ministry has had just four leaders: Andrei Kozyrev , Yevgeny Primakov , Igor Ivanov and Sergei Lavrov -against thirteen SC secretaries and ten chiefs of the Administration of the President over the same period. Unlike the SC and AP chiefs, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has weathered the cadre reshuffling after the end of the Vladimir Putin presidency. In the first year President Dmitry Medvedev replaced only two of the eight vice ministers of foreign affairs and he chose to make only one important ambassadorial appointment, to the U.S. In fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had undergone much more significant personnel changes following the nomination of Sergei Lavrov as minister and at the beginning of Vladimir Putin's second term as president in 2004-including replacements of ambassadors to Germany, Italy, Serbia, India, Brazil and Argentina. The Foreign Ministry's weakness is connected with the conceptual sphere of Russia's foreign policy and with the Ministry's role being limited to implementing the policy line adopted. With competition from the SC and the AP, the Ministry is incapable of setting on its own the direction of this policy. It is highly symptomatic that it was only towards the end of the 1990s that a separate foreign policy planning department was established within the Ministry of Foreign AffairsThe department's achievements and operating mode were severely criticized after the developments in Ukraine during the 2004 ""Orange Revolution. The strong position of the secretary of the Security Council and the SC staff in shaping the RF's external policy has much to do with their unrestricted access to state information,55 a prerogative arising from the function performed by the SC apparatus. This function chiefly involves preparing materials for sittings of the SC's numerous inter-governmental commissions that address matters of internal and external security-military, social, economic, in information, ecology and other areas. The SC's foremost weakness is due to personnel assessments and expectations by which Russian presidents have been guided in appointing consecutive secretaries of the Council. Frequent replacements and the practice of reserving these appointments for actual or potential adversaries of the president have effectively undercut the SC's position in the process of shaping the foreign policy of the RF. During Boris Yeltsin's presidency Yevgeny Shaposhnikov and Aleksandr Lebed served as SC secretaries. Similarly, during Vladimir Putin's presidency the office was held by Vladimir Rushailo and Igor Ivanov (former foreign minister and a protegeé of Yevgeny Primakov, a would-be rival to Vladimir Putin in the 1999 presidential campaign)Besides, the office of the SC secretary was briefly held by Vladimir Putin and Sergei Ivanov . In their case the function was a test of leadership capabilities required in successive state positions. The SC's significance was undermined by a protracted vacancy at the post of its secretary following Igor Ivanov's resignation in July 2007. It was only after the swearing in of President Dmitry Medvedev in May 2008 that Nikolai Patrushev became the new secretary. The appointment of this long-time security service chief is unlikely to strengthen the Council's position. Patrushev's closest co-workers in the SC include many people whose present positions are lower than those they held previously. The Council's deputy secretaries include General Yuri Baluyevsky, former chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the RF, and Yuri Zubakov, former head of the Administration of the Government , with the aides featuring Vladislav Sherstyuk, former head of the dissolved Federal Agency of Governmental Communication and Information , and Vladimir Zavershinsky, former first deputy of the Foreign Intelligence chief. The new SC secretary worked for over a year on a draft security strategy, which was approved by the president only in May 2009. Some analysts see this as evidence of Patrushev's inability to coordinate the work of the commissions operating within the SCThey note that early versions of the strategy were rejected by Medvedev in February and March 2009, while a socio-economic concept developed at the same time by the government was approved by the president half a year earlier. The impact of the Administration of the President on shaping the state's foreign policy seems to have remained practically unchanged since the formation of this body in 1991, primarily due to the confidence of all presidents that the Administration personnel has enjoyed. It should be noted that the staff advising the current president on international affairs has held presidential administration positions since the mid-1990s, with some of them-such as Sergei Prikhodko, Aleksandr Manzhosin or Sergei Yastrzhembsky-playing important roles for years. They have cultivated their good relations with the MFA leadership dating back to Soviet times, when they all served with the Ministry. The AP's position, close to the president of Russia as the decision-making center, brings to mind the Soviet-era position of the CC Secretariat relative to the party secretary general. Yet in the case of foreign policy this analogy does not seem fully justified. Presidential advisors and aides for international affairs in the AP are incapable of competing with the MFA the way the International Department of the CC did, because, unlike the ID, they have no external structures whatsoever Of the other state institutions with an important impact on the process of foreign policy decision-making, the Ministry of Defense merits attention. The military's influence on Russia's foreign policy, in particular towards the former Soviet republics, was demonstrably at its peak immediately after the breakup of the Soviet Union, when General Pavel Grachev headed the Ministry. In the 1990s the RF's policy towards conflicts in Transnistria, Tajikistan, the Caucasus or in the Crimea was largely shaped by this MinistryBesides the post-Soviet area, the MD also took a keen interest in the Balkans directionSince 2001, when Sergei Ivanov was appointed minister of defense, the MD's interest in international affairs has been less and less noticeable as this institution has focused on internal matters of the armed forces. Ivanov was the first minister of defense without an armed forces background . The reform of the armed forces that he championed triggered numerous conflicts with Russian generals, in particular with Chief of Staff Aleksandr KvashninThe appointment of Anatoly Serdyukov-another civilian to head the Ministry-as the minister in 2007 has not improved mattersIndeed, the MD was excluded from negotiations on further arms reductions with the U.S. In time a joint consultation group established in 2002 came under the exclusive control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Security and Disarmament DepartmentIt was the Georgia conflict and the U.S. plan to build an anti-missile shield that enabled the MD to resume an important role in developing Russia's position on defense and foreign policy. Also, now that the deadline for the withdrawal of Russia's Red Fleet from the Crimea is drawing near, the MD's position in the shaping of the RF's foreign policy will be more and more important Special services' significant impact on the RF's foreign policy has been observable since the mid-1990s. Earlier, the Foreign Intelligence Service and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were in dispute over the main directions of Russia's international activity. The SVR leadership often criticized the pro-Western course pursued by the MFAThe conflict with the MFA ended in the victory of the Foreign Intelligence Service in January 1996, when Yevgeny Primakov became the minister of foreign affairs owing to a favorable internal situation in the wake of the parliamentary electoral victory of the communists and nationalists. Since then more and more members of intelligence staff have been placed in key positions at the MFAAnother reason why the Foreign Intelligence Service has preserved its strong position in shaping the RF's foreign policy is that it submits directly to the president weekly intelligence reports containing political evaluations and intelligence chief-favored strategies for action by the head of state Much as in the Soviet era, there is a specific geographical and thematic specialization of the institutions involved in implementing the external policy of the RF. This is particularly true of the MFA, which is engaged in developing Russia's bilateral relations with most states worldwide. With regard to international organizations, the MFA focuses on Russia's activity in the UN -and much less in the Council of Europe, the OSCE, or towards the EU and NATO. This is evidenced by the Ministry's organizational pattern with no separate departments for relations with the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the EU or NATO . The Security Council has been demonstrably regionally-focused for years, mainly on the post-Soviet states-the chief reason being that there are similar institutions functioning there. Recently the SC secretary has been meeting more and more often with officials responsible for security in China, Brazil and India as the four states are brought closer within the BRIC group. Also, CS staff members participate in Russia's security cooperation with the U.S. and NATO. The staff of the Administration of the President seems rather uninvolved in matters of national defense and security. The AP's organizational structure does not provide for a department to deal with these issues. On the other hand, presidential aides play an important role at G8 and G20 meetings. Until recently, there was a position within the AP of special presidential envoy for the development of the Russian Federation's relations with the European Union. This position was eliminated in 2008, which shows that Russia has been attaching less and less importance to the EU as a whole and has sought instead to build good bilateral relations with EU member states on a one-to-one basis. The prime minister's responsibility for social and economic matters gives the government apparatus a privileged position in dealing with such international institutions as the WTO, OECD, IMF or the World Bank. The Ministries of Industry and Trade, Energy, Finance, or of Economic Development, which report to the prime minister, play a key role in accession negotiations and talks with representatives of these institutions. Since Vladimir Putin became prime minister, the government has been pursuing an increasingly active international policy, primarily on energy issues, as evidenced by the numerous foreign trips paid by Vice Premier Igor Sechin and Minister Sergei Shmatko, who are responsible for oil and natural gas exports. Conclusions The president of Russia is in charge of foreign policy and makes the most important decisions in this area. Yet the exercise of the president's broad constitutional powers is undermined by the absence of effective mechanisms to coordinate the work of the different executive bodies, both in the conceptual sphere and in the sphere of implementing Russia's foreign policy. This provides a broad scope for informal factors of all descriptions. The establishment of the Security Council of the RF-a collective body similar to the Politburo of the CC CPSU, on which the heads of major party and state institutions sat-does not solve the problem. Firstly, the heads of the economic ministries, who report to the prime minister and who shape Russian foreign policy to a certain extent, do not sit on the SC. Secondly, the work of ministries should be coordinated and positions on international issues agreed at some stage preceding the SC meetings chaired by the president. So far, attempts to establish a commission to coordinate the work of the different executive authorities in the area of foreign policy, both within the SC and the MFA, have been unsuccessful. Their failure is attributable to the overlapping and imprecisely defined powers of the AP, SC and the MFA in the area of conceptualization and implementation of Russia's foreign policy. As a result, representatives of the different institutions vie, much as in the Soviet era, for influence on the final decision. The president, who is responsible for the foreign policy of the state, is likely to find himself at times in a position of an umpire choosing among mutually exclusive interpretations of developments and recommendations for action. This situation favors a strong position of the special services , whose leaders have direct access to the president and can present him with their own analytical reports without going through civilian officials. The decision-making system that has developed in Russia will need major modifications in the nearest future as the impact of economic issues on Russia's international position continues to grow. The scope of the president and prime minister's powers with respect to the different executive bodies should be rephrased, as should the roles of the SC, MFA and AP in coordinating the conceptualization and implementation of Russia's foreign policy. The position of representatives of the ministries responsible for economic and financial matters-both in the supreme decision-making bodies and at earlier stages of hammering out cohesive positions-should be formally strengthened. It is these institutions, rather than the special services, the AP or the MFA, that are capable of coming up with a coherent vision of Russia's participation in the global process of economic integration and reformed financial architecture. The greater the transformation of international financial and economic relations, the more difficult it will be to maintain in Russia a coherent foreign policy, which is largely underpinned by informal factors."
11596ff6-c341-48ff-a347-ff1d00378853,"Abstract: Russia has experienced an agricultural rebound since 2000 that has its origins in more state intervention and government assistance programs. Ironically, as agricultural production has increased Russia has become more protectionist in its food trade policies, and the pursuit of food security is a central feature of the political vocabulary. In addition, Russia has emerged as a global grain exporter, with plans to expand exports into markets that have traditionally been dominated by the United States. Keywords: Agriculture, food policy, foreign policy, Medvedev, Obama, Russia, United States Russia's food policy often falls under the radar of many analysts, and therefore the purpose of this article is to analyze contemporary policy trends, to explain how those policy trends fit with Russia's foreign policy, and to examine how food policy may affect USRussian relations going forward. The article argues that Russian food policy is an inherent component of the multidimensional challenge to the United States. Specifically, the article demonstrates that Russia's contemporary food policy strategy consists of three overlapping components: an increase in domestic production, facilitated by government financial support programs; the pursuit of ""food security"" through the limitation of foreign states' access to food markets within Russia; and an increase in Russia's food exports, specifically grain, thereby making Russia a major player in global food trade. These three elements are integrated to form a unified food policy strategy, a fact that augurs for food trade to become an increasingly significant factor in relations between Russia and the US An underappreciated aspect of US-Russian relations is the fact that food policy has often occupied an important place in the bilateral relationship. In the 1970s, the ""great grain robbery"" embarrassed the Nixon administration and infuriated American consumers who ended up subsidizing wheat exports to the USSRIn the early 1980s, Ronald Reagan banned wheat exports to the USSR in retaliation for its invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. Despite the export ban by the United States, the Soviet Union remained a large importer of grain, with imports rising from 27million tons in 1980 to 44million tons in 1985During 1986-1990, the USSR averaged 32million tons of imported grain annually, a statistic that represented about 14 percent of total consumptionIn the post-Soviet period, beginning in the mid-1990s, Russia began to use concerns over food sanitation as a pretext for trade protectionism. As a result, bilateral food trade between the US and Russia was punctuated by repeated import bans imposed by Russia on US meat and poultry exports. Following Russia's worst grain harvest since the 1950s in 1998, the US provided food aid to Russia, which, while well-intended, created resentment among Russian policymakers. Import bans on US poultry and other meat continued during Putin's presidency-in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008After Dmitry Medvedev assumed the presidency, in May 2009 Russia banned imports of all meats from all states in the US in response to the H1N1 outbreak in the United States, even though the flu virus was not spread by raw or processed meatEffective in January 2010, Russia imposed a ban on the importation of poultry that was treated with chlorine as a disinfectant, a move that directly affected US poultry exports to Russia and could have negative effects on the relationship, according to US Secretary of Agriculture Tom VilsackBased on the historical and contemporary importance of bilateral relations over food, an analysis of current trends in Russia is warranted. The analysis of Russia's food policy intersects with three theoretical issues in the political economy literature. The role of the state in the development of agrarian capitalism- in essence, laissez-fare policies in which government intervention is minimized, versus a state capitalist model in which the state adopts a more active role. A second theoretical issue concerns the factors that affect the openness of foreign trade policy. A third theoretical issues concerns the efficacy of commodity cartels. Here, the question is: What is a cartel, and will Russia will be able to form a grain commodity cartel that will work? The Foreign Policy Context for Russia's Food Policy The assertiveness in Russian foreign policy that analysts have attributed to robust economic growth, higher revenue flows from the sale of oil and gas, and societal stabilization since 2000 has not abated with a change in Russian presidentsDespite hitting the ""reset"" button in 2009, Washington and Moscow continue to have fundamentally different views about several key international issues. In an interview about US-Russian relations in March 2010, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that ""I will not say we are opponents, but we are not friends, either. Under the new administration a new atmosphere in relations between the presidents did indeed appear, and is persisting. I acknowledge that the atmosphere has also improved between the US secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister, it has become more constructive, tending more to foster the search for some kind of generally acceptable solutions. But this is not felt at every level.The bilateral relationship has been complicated by the fact that since 2004 domestic political development in Russia has moved from ""partly free"" to ""not free,"" according to Freedom House's democracy rankings Following a flurry of cooperation after September 11, 2001, that extended through 2002, the US-Russian relationship has been adrift for several years; at times, it has been characterized by tension and rancor, suspicion, and lack of cooperation on issues that are crucial to international stabilityThe general distrust and tension in the relationship, along with a general rollback in democratization that began under President Vladimir Putin, led some analysts in Washington to speak of a reemerging Cold War. Although Russia has not attempted to create an alternative institutional structure for international politics or economics, it has challenged US primacy and interests in a variety of waysA series of Russian moves during the early days of the Medvedev administration created an atmosphere reminiscent of the Cold War. Immediately after President Obama was elected, Russia challenged US missile defense in Europe and threatened to target NATO allies with missiles,13 a position that Medvedev later backed away from while continuing to insist that missile defense is linked to strategic arms reduction. Russia floated the idea of building military bases in the Caribbean, and its nuclear subs stopped in Cuba for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Although the idea of military bases subsequently was placed on the back burner, Russia has been the arms-supplier of first resort for both Cuba and Venezuela, countries that maintain an antagonistic stance toward the US. In 2009, Russia resumed submarine patrols off the US coast for the first time since the end of the Cold War. In its border zones Russia continues to insist that it has ""special privileged interest,"" which essentially means the right to hegemony over Ukraine and Georgia. Consistent political and economic pressure was applied on Ukraine prior to the election of Viktor Yanukovych as president in early 2010, reflected by repeated cutoffs of natural gas in recent years. And in August 2009, Medvedev stated that he would not post a new ambassador to Ukraine until it ceased its ""anti-Russian behavior.In the aftermath of the 2010 election, Yanukovych pledged to balance Ukrainian policy between Russia and the West, which in essence represented a repudiation of the explicitly pro-Western policies pursued by his predecessorThe 2008 military incursion into Georgia, although now understood not to have been initiated by Russia, has been broadly interpreted as a signal to Georgia not to join NATO, and occurred following what was essentially economic warfare between the two nations. For years, a de facto ban on travel from Russia to Georgia was in place, and a trade embargo existed on many goods, including Georgian wine. In recent years, Russia has experienced an agricultural recovery that allows its international food policy to be used as an instrument of foreign policy. International food policy fits well within the country's ""National Security Strategy to 2020"" , which was approved by presidential decree in May 2009, thereby replacing the one that had been in effect since December 1997. The NSS posits Russia as global actor, with the goal to become a top-five economic power and a major international food supplierIt also constitutes a framework for a subset of other security doctrines, including a food-security doctrine that was signed into force by President Medvedev at the end of January 2010; more will be said about this later in this article. Just as Russia's foreign policy acquiescence to the West disappeared when Boris Yeltsin left the presidency, gone too are the days of food shortages and massive imports of Western grain. Russia's agricultural production has rebounded from its low in the 1990s, and during 2000-2008 the ruble value of agricultural production more than tripledDuring the financial crisis in Russia, agriculture was the only sector of the economy to achieve real growth, with the value of production rising over 10 percent in 2008 in comparison to 2007In 2009, the agricultural sector experienced a growth of 1percent compared to a decline in total GDP of almost 9 percentSince 2006, the Russian government has poured tens of billions of rubles into the agricultural sector-for commodity price supports, for the construction of rural infrastructure, for the leasing of agricultural machinery and equipment, and for the rebuilding of animal stocks. As stated in the NSS, the explicit intent of government support is to achieve national food security and to reduce dependence on foreign food imports by strengthening domestic producers Food Shortages and Hunger The inefficiencies of the Soviet planned economy- infamous for long lines, shortages of consumer goods, and poor quality products-reverberated throughout the entire economic system. There were many examples of shortcomings within Soviet collectivized agriculture, although Gale Johnson argued that, ""I believe now that the socialized nature of Soviet agriculture is not the major source of difficulties. Many other aspects of Soviet planning, management systems, and pricing are far more important in limiting agriculture's performance than is its socialized nature. For the Soviet consumer, food shortages were primarily a result of the dysfunctional pricing policy adopted by the Communist party. Food price policy was a political decision that was intended for propaganda purposes-in order to make cheap food accessible to all, the government heavily subsidized the price of food. Thus, wholesale prices were lower than farm production costs, and retail prices were lower than wholesale pricesThe consequence was ""excess demand"" for food products that were vastly underpriced at the retail level, leading to chronic shortages and long lines in stores. In 1990, retail food subsidies accounted for 56 percent of total agricultural subsidies, a statistic that rose to 80 percent in 1991As the Soviet planned economy unraveled during Gorbachev's reforms, the vast system of subsidies became unsustainable and inflation increased rapidly for food goods Although official government statistics painted the picture of steady, albeit slowly, rising per capita consumption during the 1970s and most of the 1980s, toward the end of the 1980s the reality for consumers was chronic shortages, poor quality, poor selection, and even food-rationing beginning in the winter of 1990-91. In spring 1991, Gorbachev charged the KGB to ensure that food was delivered to state food stores and not pilfered en route. To compensate for food shortages, more and more people relied on ""personal subsidiary agriculture"" , or private plots, as they were commonly called in the Western literature. These plots were ""vital to the survival of the peasant family"" by providing the bulk of the meat and vegetables consumed in peasant families, and nearly every rural household had a private plotThe output from these small plots of land, usually around hectares per household, was estimated at about 25 percent of the value of total production, although output was concentrated in meat, vegetables, and potatoesSmaller, but also ""private"" were collective fruit or vegetable gardens which represented an important supplementary source of food for urban families. Together, tens of millions of collective and state farm workers, and urban workers and their families were engaged in ""private agriculture"" in the 1980sThese plots also provided rural households a means for survival during the turbulent 1990s. The immediate post-Communist government under Boris Yeltsin moved quickly to end the Soviet system of food subsidies to consumers. As a consequence, retail food prices skyrocketed-rising 2,670 percent in 1992, 940 percent in 1993, and 330 percent in 1994At the same time, domestic food production nosedived as farming enterprises saw the array of subsidies to which they had grown accustomed cut drastically. As consumer demand fell due to rising prices, large farming enterprises cut production and reduced their livestock herds in response to falling earnings. Reductions in production were so great that large farms no longer could meet even diminished domestic demand. By mid-decade, former state and collective farms were producing only 43 percent of their 1990 production level, and production fell to 36 percent in 1998 before starting to reboundIn total, agricultural production declined to an estimated 40 percent of its 1990 level before beginning to increase in 1999. In turn, declining domestic food production and decreased purchasing power led to lower per capita consumption and changes in dietary structure during the 1990s, whereby Russian consumers increased their intake of starches and carbohydrates and reduced their consumption of proteins and fatsConservatives argued that Russian citizens were increasingly malnourished as a result of market reform, and the term ""food security"" began to creep into the political vocabulary Even with reduced demand, domestic production was insufficient to feed the nation, so Russia turned to food importsThe dollar value of Russia's food imports rose from about $2 billion in 1989 to $5billion in 1993 and to $13billion in 1997Although the early 1990s witnessed production declines for grains and processed foods, the animal husbandry sector fared the worst, as livestock herds plummeted in size to levels found in the late 1950sBecause consumers turned to cheap alternatives for their protein, in the 1990s Russia became the largest importer of poultry meat in the world. Poultry imports rose from 500,000 tons in 1994 to 1million tons in 1997, with 70 percent coming from the United StatesUS poultry exporters earned in excess of $1 billion annually from trade with Russia from about mid-decade onward. Other food imports increased as well: during 1994-1997 beef imports increased by a factor of 1, pork imports increased by a factor of 1, and imports of processed foods increased by a factor of 5By the late 1990s, Russian government officials argued that large cities in Russia received 70-80 percent of their meat from foreign importsWith low import tariffs and an open trade policy, the dollar value of food imports far exceeded financial support for domestic producers from the Russian government. Russia's financial collapse and devaluation of the ruble in 1998 coincided with the smallest grain harvest in 40 years in Russia-less than 48 million tonsThe devaluation of the ruble reduced demand for imported foodstuffs, and with higher priced imports the dollar value of food imports declined to $10billion in 1998 before bottoming out at $7billion in 2000, when the level once again began to increaseAs a result of the poor harvest in 1998, Russia turned to the West to avoid starvation in certain regions of the Far East. In November 1998, the US set up a $1 billion food aid package consisting of $600 million in humanitarian assistance and a $400 million line of credit at 2 percent interest for 20 years to purchase additional food. Food aid from the US began to arrive in Russia in March 1999. In November 1998, the European Union had offered a $480 million package of food aid, including one million tons of wheat and 150,000 tons of beef, for free. The International Red Cross and Canada had also provided an aid package, although not as extensiveIn January 1999, the US donated additional seed for Russia's spring sowing. When Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency in 2000, Russia was still receiving food aid from the West. Agricultural Recovery Through State Assistance Flowing from the liberalization and privatization of Communist-era command economies, a variety of ""capitalisms"" emerged in the post-Communist worldAs one author argued, ""transition countries have had different starting points and final targets, in a multidimensional space, with a movement neither linear nor uniform, and not even uni-directional nor consistently followed.In particular, three ideal-type models for organizing the economies of post-Communist states have been identified. The first is a neoliberal, rapid, laissez faire model-shock therapy-that was premised on the establishment of market relations followed by the creation of supporting legal, economic, and political institutions. This approach was used in Poland and the Czech Republic. A second model is the neoclassical gradualist approach, in which supporting institutions are created before economic liberalization is attempted; this more gradualist approach to the development of capitalism was pursued in Hungary and Romania. A third ideal type is the post-Keynesian model, which argues against radical and rapid economic reforms, and instead advocates gradual liberalization and active government intervention Within this variety in capitalist models, Russia started with neoliberalist shock therapy in January 1992, but spring 1992 and thereafter brought a series of government retreats that ended this experiment. The appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister in December 1992 officially ended this method, and for the duration of the 1990s Russia's approach was one of state withdrawal from active intervention in the agricultural sector. Starting in 1999 the approach was reversed. The upshot is that Russia's agrarian capitalism since 1999 has been more closely associated with the post-Keynesian model and an active, interventionist role for the state. The significant decline in agricultural production during most of the 1990s precluded both a coherent food policy and retarded significant movement toward agrarian capitalism, as most large farms and rural households were merely trying to survive. The development of genuine agrarian capitalism could only ensue with economic growth, and that started to occur only after 1999-but Russia's pursuit of agrarian capitalism is state-led, not a result of laissez faire policies. How is the turnabout in strategy explained? The political humiliation of Western food aid in the late 1990s laid the basis for cardinal changes in Russia's food policy. In the latter days of the Yeltsin presidency, a ""new course"" in agrarian policy was articulated that was premised on a dramatic increase in government support to the agricultural sectorThus, the rebound in production and the foundation for agrarian capitalism is grounded in government financial assistance and supportive policies. The agricultural sector under Yeltsin was starved for resources, but once Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency revitalizing agriculture became a national prioritySince 2000, Russia has experienced positive sectoral growth for each of the three categories of food producers in every year except 2003, as shown in Table 1. Due in large part to government financial support and market intervention, volumes of production have increased for most food commodities, as shown in Table 2; and especially impressive have been the gains in yields, shown in Table 3. The primary reason for Russia's successful rebound in agricultural production may be explained by the fact that government initiatives for financial support have been purposeful, comprehensive, and multidimensional. The policy changes and support programs adopted by the Russian government extended far beyond production subsidies that are commonly used in other countries. Of primary importance among government initiatives in Russia was a program for the financial recovery of large farms, an important move because large farms produce most of the food used for domestic consumption and export to foreign nations. Paradoxically, during the 1990s large farms saw their debt levels increase substantially, even as they cut production. The Putin government believed that debt-ridden farms would be unable to invest in capital improvements or increase production. In 2002, the government adopted a program in which a large amount of overdue farm debt and penalties were written off or repayments were delayed as part of the financial recovery package. Through 2004, more than R58 billion in debt was restructured and R28 billion of penalties and fines were written offThe effect was tangible: in succeeding years, the percentage of unprofitable large farms fell from about 89 percent in 1998 to 35 percent by 2004 and then to about 22 percent in 2007In addition the agricultural sector showed an aggregate profitability, although the growing of plant products was much more profitable than animal husbandry, and the production of wool, poultry, and beef remained unprofitable. 48 Other government sponsored support programs were also introduced: * the creation of a state-owned agricultural bank through which government credits and loans were channeled. * the adoption of a single unified agricultural tax, that in effect acted like a flat tax. * the adoption of a price support system for grain crops. In years of good harvests, the government buys surplus grain in order to prevent wholesale prices from dropping too low and threatening farms' solvency. Government purchase of surplus grain has occurred in every year since 2001-except during the drought year of 2003-and was used in 2009 as well. For 2010, the Russian government announced its intention to use grain intervention following the harvest, and in spring 2010 set purchase prices for the different classes of grain. * an increase in the volume of financial support through investment, the subsidization of interest rates for investment loans, and the extension of subsidized credit. * direct production subsidies for meat and milk delivered to state-licensed reception agents. * a state program whereby the government purchases agricultural machinery and pedigree livestock from abroad and then leases these assets directly to large farms or private farmers at subsidized rates. * a program to protect and restore the fertility of agricultural land. * state support to subsidize the purchase of mineral fertilizer. The government's financial support culminated in 2005 when agriculture was made one of four priority sectors in the economy under the auspices of ""The National Project""; in 2006, the government introduced a R50 billion development program for agriculture. The goals of this program were to increase livestock herds and production of animal husbandry products; to develop small farming enterprises ; to facilitate the creation of various types of rural cooperatives; and to build rural housing in order to retain young agricultural specialists and their families in the countryside, thereby creating sustainable rural communitiesIn 2007, this program was renewed and extended to 2008-2012, during which time R551billion will be financed from the federal budget and a total of R1trillion will be allocated from the consolidated budget These monetary obligations reflect the priority that policymakers have placed on agricultural development. Even after the 2008 financial crisis hit Russia, President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin reaffirmed the strategic importance of agriculture and promised to maintain funding. In December 2008, for example, Putin stated that ""it is necessary to retain the volumes and terms of credit to the agricultural branch ... As in previous years, we will make agriculture an exception to ease pressure on it.In mid-2009, President Medvedev announced that agriculture was the only sector of the economy that was showing positive growth, and he promised to continue to fund the agricultural recovery Rising Protectionism and Food Security The active state and Russia's rising protectionism touches upon a second theoretical issue-factors that affect the openness of trade policy. Generally speaking, analysts have identified structural and political factors that affect international trade policy. In terms of structural factors, the size of a country, the size of a country's economy, and its level of development are said to affect trade policy; countries that have developing economies or those with smaller GDP may opt for higher degrees of protectionism in order to protect uncompetitive sectorsBut this line of argumentation has limitations, as it does not explain trade polices in contemporary Japan and China, both of which are protectionist even though they were the number two and number three economies in the world in terms of nominal GDP in 2009, respectively. Moreover, although protectionism may be commodity specific, the weakness or strength of a sector in the economy is not necessarily a determining factor in openness or protectionism, witnessed by high-growth economies in Taiwan and Korea in the 1980s that chose to protect their farmersTherefore, politics do matter- other factors may include regime type, domestic politics and political constellations, and the political orientation and strategies of the ruling political elite When Russia's agricultural sector began to rebound after 1999, it adopted the model used by Japan after World War II and by other emerging Asian economies in the 1980s to protect domestic food producers. Thus, even though Prime Minister Putin in March 2010 promised that Russia would not resort to ""excessive protectionism,"" a second element of Russia's food policy strategy since 2000 has been characterized by the limitation of market access for foreign states, and ""food security"" has become a central component of Russia's political discourse over food trade with other nationsAt the same time, we should note that Russia's protectionism in agricultural trade is not uniform-when Putin was president he indicated that selectively higher tariffs and import quotas would be levied on food commodities that directly compete with domestic production. Other products that do not constitute a threat to Russian production would not be targeted. The centrality of food security is reflected in the comment from Duma member Sergei Abel'tsev, who argued that, ""the most important strategic question for us in these conditions is the attainment of food independence for the Russian Federation."" 57 Advocacy for food security routinely emanates from the office of the president; as president, Putin repeatedly stated that the nation must reduce food imports. In June 2009, Medvedev went so far as to declare that high levels of dependence on foreign meat and poultry is ""dangerous"" because consumer prices can increase rapidly with changes in the ruble-dollar exchange rateIn January 2010, Minister of Agriculture Elena Skrynnik affirmed that food security is ""one of the central and prioritized problems in the system of national security.In March 2010, she predicted that Russia would achieve ""complete self-sufficiency in meat, milk, and sugar...within the next four to five years as the Food Security Doctrine envisions. Moving from rhetoric to policy, since 2000 Russia has used a variety of strategies for its food trade protectionism, including import bans and embargoes against specific countries. One form of protectionism has been the use of import tariffs to protect domestic producers. The average tariff rate on imported food has almost doubled since 2000, from 10 to 18 percent, which is not especially high by global standards; many developing nations have much higher tariff ratesThe main instruments to limit imports have been the introduction of import quotas, and the use of a quota and tariff system used in tandem. Meat import quotas were first established in 2001 and are expected to remain in force at least until 2015 for meat and until 2020 for fish products. In 2003, Russia introduced tariff rate quotas to limit imports of beef, pork, and poultry. The quota and tariff system applies lower tariff rates to imports up to the established import quota, and higher tariff rates are applied to imports above the quota. In January 2009 the Russian government made the system more restrictive for poultry and pork, when the poultry quota was reduced and the out-of-quota tariff was raised from 40 to 95 percent. The out-of-quota tariff for pork was raised form 40 to 75 percentDespite the fact that meat imports have increased since 2001, they most likely would be much higher without the TRQ system. In December 2009, Putin signed into force new import quotas for beef, pork and poultry for 2010-2012. Those quota limits are shown in Table 4 and placed in context with 2006-2009. The table reflects the fact that during the next three years the import quota for fresh or chilled beef imports will remain stable, while that for frozen beef will increase about 18 percent to 530 thousand tons compared to 2009. Import quotas for pork will decrease 20 percent by 2012, and quotas for poultry will decline by 43 percent by 2012 . Not shown, but should be noted, is the fact that each of those aggregate quotas contain a sub-quota on how much the US is allowed to export before facing higher tariff levels. Even with protectionist measures, the growth in real monetary incomes that resulted from economic growth since 2000 in turn raised consumer demand, and as a consequence the rate of growth in food imports has been faster than the rate of growth in domestic productionThat is, as incomes grew, consumer preferences shifted from low value food products such as carbohydrates and starches to meat products. Because domestic producers have not been able to meet demand for high value meat products, imports grew. Russian policymakers understand that the root of their food insecurity/food importation ""problem"" stems from inadequate domestic supply, and therefore the governmental programs described above and in Skrynnik's predictions about self-sufficiency are significant. Food security as a political campaign in Russia has gathered steam since 2005, driven in part by the fact that during 2005-2008 the dollar value of food imports into Russia more than doubled, reaching over $35 billion in 2008In November 2008, a ""Food Security Doctrine"" was drafted and published by the Ministry of Agriculture. A final version of this doctrine was signed into force by presidential decree at the end of January 2010Article 1 of this doctrine states that it proceeds from the ""National Security Strategy to 2020,"" discussed above, and Article 4 states that the doctrine serves as the basis from which future laws will be developed for food security and development of the agroindustrial complex. The doctrine calls for ""food independence of the Russian Federation"" based upon quantitative and qualitative measures as established by Russian law. Importantly, in Section 2, Article 8, the doctrine establishes quantitative indicators for food supply that domestic production should fulfill. For example, to achieve food security, Russia aims to produce 95 percent of the grain it consumes, 95 percent of its potatoes, 85 percent of its meat and meat products, 80 percent of its fish products, and 90 percent of its milk and milk products. Russia as a Global Food Supplier The third theoretical issue raised by Russia's food policy strategy concerns the creation and efficacy of commodity cartels. Economists agree that a genuine cartel must meet at least six basic characteristics: the ability to divide the market among cartel members by having a quota system; the ability to monitor the quota system to identify violators; the ability to punish cheaters and quota violators; the ability to enforce cartel authority; the ability to support prices and to prevent high prices that lead to substitution and erosion of market control for the cartel; and the ability to capture a large market share to the extent that the cartel controls the marketOne team of authors has argued that OPEC, which is often considered to be among the most successful cartels, does not meet fully the criteria for a cartel as developed in the theoretical literatureThe discussion below of Russian foreign food trade strategy focuses on domestic policies that affect food exports and Russia's potential to form a grain cartel. Russian policymakers have made it clear that their goal for Russia is to become a major food exporter. Food security and becoming a global exporter go hand in hand. An increase in domestic production ensures that Russia can meet its own domestic needs without reliance on foreign sources, and at the same time increased production provides surpluses for export. Similar to the importance of Russian energy exports, Russia hopes to carve out an analogous role in helping to meet global demand for food. In March 2010, Minister Skrynnik and Josette Sheeran, Executive Director of the World Food Program , signed a memorandum of mutual understanding, after which Skrynnik stated that ""our cooperation with the World Food Program carries a strategically important character.According to Gavin Maguire, a director at a Chicago brokerage, ""they are some years away from being considered a massive grain powerhouse. If they did invest significantly in the infrastructure there...we could have something interesting emerge over the next decade or so. Despite the long-term nature of Russia's goal, it is already emerging as an important grain exporter-Russia ranked number three in the world in volume of wheat exports in 2008 and 2009, after the US and CanadaThe vice president of Russia's Grain Union, Aleksandr Korbut, suggested that during the next five years Russia should ""do everything in its power to rank number two in the world in grain exports.At the June 2009 World Grain Forum held in St. Petersburg, which Russia hosted to reflect its status as a grain exporter, Medvedev stated that Russia intends to expand grain exports to new geographical regions, including Southeast Asia. Statements by Medvedev and Skrynnik at the World Grain Forum reflect Russia's strategy and outline the domestic initiatives that are underway to achieve its goals. For example, Russia plans to bring into production some 20 million hectares of abandoned farmland in order to increase grain harvests. Medvedev also pointed out that Russia intends to invest in infrastructure that would facilitate grain exports, stating that, ""the most important task in the near future is to actively support infrastructure projects. This is the modernization and creation of new storage capacity, development of a system of transportation networks, and development of shipping capacity at sea and river ports.Minister Skrynnik seconded Medvedev when she argued that ""it is not tolerable to delay...it is necessary to bring words into action through serious investment in infrastructure, creating a strong base for long-term competitiveness of grain from the Black Sea region. We are already working in this direction."" In April 2010, Prime Minister Putin indicated that, ""we will develop ports in the Far East, build elevators, and perfect our tariff policy so that Siberian bread will be present in the Russian and in world food markets. The Russian government's assistance programs-subsidized fertilizer, subsidized equipment leasing, grain price supports, and state purchases of grain surpluses-have had a demonstrable effect on the grain sector. Russia exported only 594,000 tons of wheat in 2000, which rose to 10million tons in 2005, even as the number of hectares under cultivation continued to declineSince 2005, Russia has averaged over 12 million tons of grain exports annually. Grain exports exceeded 17 million tons during the 2007-2008 agricultural year ; more than 22 million tons during the 2008-2009 agricultural year; and even though the 2009 harvest dropped to 97 million tons in 2009, Skrynnik stated that Russia intends to export 20 million tons during the 2009-2010 agricultural yearIn order to ""stimulate"" grain exports, the Russian government allocated R5 billion in its 2010 budget, and another R9 billion for protecting and restoring soil fertility In addition to introducing domestic economic initiatives to increase grain production and export, Russia has floated the idea of forming a Black Sea grain bloc with Ukraine and Kazakhstan to increase production, manage grain reserves, and develop rail and port capacity. If such a bloc came into being, it would raise the combined share of Russian, Ukrainian, and Kazakh wheat to 30-35 percent of world trade, up from its present 24 percent. 77 If formed, this bloc would surpass the grain export capacity of the US, which is the world's leading grain exporter, accounting for 20 percent of world trade grain Following the June 2009 World Grain Forum, the US warned Russia about creating a global grain cartel. Michael Michener of USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service remarked that, ""the Russian idea does look like a cartel. We would even say to Russia: be cautious about it. If it is done in a way that trade is distortive and trade prohibitive, I think it would affect Russia's application to the WTO. In reality, however, the likelihood of Russia forming a successful grain cartel is remote, for several reasons. First, the criteria for the creation of a successful cartel would be hard to meet-such a cartel would not control at least 65 percent of the world grain market, and importing countries could substitute corn or soybeans even if Russia were able to somehow corner the wheat market . Second, without a clear hegemon to control the cartel, it is not at all clear that a quota system could be enforced or that violations of country quotas could be punished. Third, a successful cartel would depend upon cooperative relations among the three nations, and even though new Ukrainian President Yanukovych has promised a more balanced foreign policy-in effect moving away from the pro-Western foreign policy of his predecessor-it remains to be seen how Ukrainian- Russian relations will play out in reality. It is entirely possible that future disputes over natural gas prices and deliveries will reemerge and thus affect cooperation in other economic spheres. Thus, the likelihood of an emergent Russian-led grain cartel is low. Why is Russia's international food trade strategy important? Even if any major change in the structure of world grain trade is likely to come from the Russian side unilaterally and not multilaterally , why is that significant? Russia's emergence as a global food supplier is potentially troublesome because of its record of boorish international economic behavior, and not only in energy trade. The list of food products and countries experiencing import bans and embargoes by Russia is long and varied. In just the past 10 years, live animals, including poultry, as well as meat and meat products, were banned from European Union nations . US poultry exports were restricted in 2001; banned to various degrees in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010; and have been subject to annual import quotas starting in 2003. In addition, horse and reindeer meat were banned from New Mexico, and horseflesh from Texas . Meat imports from Moldova, Ukraine, and Belarus were banned in 2005. French and German poultry was banned in 2006. Polish meat was embargoed over political differences between Moscow and Warsaw in 2006 and 2007. A ban on meat imports from Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria occurred in 2007. Rice from India was likewise banned in 2007. Georgian wine was embargoed even prior to the August 2008 military confrontation between the two countries. After US-Russian relations worsened following the 2008 Georgian crisis, 19 poultry producers in the US were banned from exporting to Russia. Food trade has been politicized even among nations considered friendly to Russia. In June 2009, a ""milk war"" broke out between Russia and Belarus in which Russia banned imports of milk and milk products over quality concerns. The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, alleged that Russia was ""blackmailing"" Belarus because the latter refused to extend diplomatic recognition to Abkhazia and South OssetiaThus, Russia's goal to become a major food exporter is likely to have international ramifications if its past behavior as an energy supplier and in food trade is duplicated. Challenges for the United States Even without a grain cartel, Russia's food policy strategy to limit imports and to expand food exports creates two specific policy challenges for the US. The first challenge concerns market access within Russia. The Russian market accounted for 1percent of total US agricultural exports in fiscal year 2007, and 1percent in 2008, with the export of poultry meat comprising the bulkAccess to the Russian domestic food market, therefore, has not been lucrative for the US, even though it does bring $1-2 billion annually to US producers. 82 The challenge is that market access is likely to decrease going forward. The rebound in Russia's domestic production, coupled with limits on imports, have affected US-Russian bilateral agricultural trade. Since the mid-1990s Russia has been the single largest importer of US poultry meat-Russia alone accounted for 20 percent of US global poultry exports in 2008, and poultry meat comprised 44 percent of the dollar value of US exports to Russia. With restrictions on market access, however, the US share of Russian food imports actually decreased from 10 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in 2008, despite the overall growth in the volume and dollar value of food imports into Russia during this period In an effort to end the periodic and arbitrary import bans imposed on US meat exports to Russia, a food trade agreement between the two countries was reached in September 2003 that ""guaranteed"" US access to the Russian market and removed 2002 quotas on US poultry exports that almost halved the value of earnings in 2002 compared to 2001A bilateral ""Meat Agreement"" reached in September 2005 established sanitary and health standards, provided rules for the inspection of processing plants, and stipulated sub-quotas for US meat exports to Russia during 2006-2009In the first year of the agreement, US exports were allocated about 4 percent of Russia's total beef quota, 11 percent of the pork quota, and 74 percent of the poultry quota, with the percentages changing slightly in subsequent yearsReflecting concern over food insecurity and the level of foreign food imports, in late 2008 the Russian government lowered the US poultry import quota for 2009 from 930,000 tons to 750,000 tons while simultaneously raising the pork quota from 50,000 to 100,000 tonsGoing forward, Russia has indicated that it will continue to increase domestic meat production at the same time that it will prioritize the limitation of foreign meat on its domestic market The second challenge for the US concerns the fact that Russia's emergence as a food exporter raises the likelihood that the two countries will compete for export markets. Specifically, Russia's ""ambitious plans"" to expand into the Asian market makes that area one of increased competition in the futureIn June 2009, Minister Skrynnik indicated that Russia intends to increase its grain production to 135 million tons and annual grain exports to 40-50 million tons to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, southern Europe, and Africa within the next ten years. At present, the EU is Russia's main trading partner, accounting for 51 percent of total foreign trade turnover in 2007 and 52 percent in 2008Asia is an area of particular interest going forward. In 2008, Asian countries accounted for only 20 percent of Russia's foreign trade turnover. However, Medvedev, Skrynnik, and Vice Premier Viktor Zubkov have made it clear that Russia plans to increase its market presence in Asia and to open more export ports in the Russian Far East in order to export Russian wheat, its main food export. At the end of May 2009, Zubkov called the development of export policy a ""strategic task for Russia"" and specified Pacific Rim countries as a future market for the export of grain and its finished byproducts such as flour and oatsAs Russia increases its market share in the Far East, the American hold on the Asian market will be confronted. During 2008-2009, Japan was the largest importer of US wheat in the world; the Philippines was fourth, South Korea was sixth, and Taiwan was eighth. In total, APEC countries constitute the primary export market for US agricultural products, accounting for 67 and 64 percent of the total value of US agricultural exports during 2007 and 2008 fiscal years, respectivelyRussia's intention to increase its presence in the Asian food market is likely, therefore, to directly compete with the economic interests of the US. Conclusion The discussion above has indicated that the Russian model as an actor in international food policy has three main characteristics: an active, interventionist state; a protectionist food trade policy; and a growing export capacity, but not necessarily as a cartel member. Emerging from its policy drift of the 1990s, the state-led initiatives reviewed above mean that Russia now has an integrated food policy strategy. Using both budgetary and non-budgetary levers, Russia's domestic and foreign food policies have made the country very influential in the sphere of international food trade for the first time since before the Bolshevik Revolution. Russia's assertive foreign policy means that competition is expanding in new directions. Russia's reemergence as a food exporter creates challenges for the West in general and for the US in particular. On the one hand, there are new opportunities for global cooperation. When opening the 2009 World Grain Forum, President Medvedev remarked that ""resolution of problems in the world grain market is one of the most important tasks connected to food security on our planet"" and he suggested that Russia was ready to supply grain to alleviate hunger in some of the poorest regions of the developing worldHis suggestion is one that the US should attempt to build upon, drawing Russia into the circle of countries that contribute food aid during emergencies. On the other hand, Russia's increased protectionism mirrors its assertive foreign policy, its behavior as an energy supplier, and the politicalization of food trade, all of which create concerns about future cooperation. What can the US do to respond to the economic challenge posed by Russian food policy? With the US-Russian relationship only starting to emerge from a decade of misunderstandings and differences, it is likely that bilateral food trade will remain underdeveloped in the near to medium term, even after President Obama's ""reset"" in March 2009. To the extent that bilateral food trade is placed on the policy agenda, the Obama administration has limited leverage over Russia's domestic policy decisions and is unlikely to be able to reverse Russia's protectionist trends. Perhaps the best attainable option is for the US to hold Russia to its agreement regarding health and sanitation standards and to try to protect US access to the Russian food market. But American opportunities are limited and success is far from assured, especially if the broader relationship experiences setbacks over other issues. Concerning competition over regional food markets, the US has a few more options to choose from-and because the Russian food policy challenge is still developing, the US has time to act proactively. At present, most US commercial grain trade contracts are for annual deliveries. Therefore, one option is to secure long-term, multiyear delivery agreements with countries in Asia in order to ""lock in"" demand for American grain. Long-term commitments run some risk in case of drought or significant production declines, but the contracts could be negotiated in such a way as to protect American consumers in such circumstances. If Russia is able to move into the Asian market due to increased efficiencies-lower production and transportation costs for instance-the US could respond appropriately in its Farm Bill; and if the challenge was severe enough, new Farm Bills could be considered every two years instead of the present four years. On the other hand, if Russia expands its market share in Asia as a result of economic policies and trading behavior not permitted under WTO rules, then the US would first want to try to negotiate the differences, and if that did not work either retaliate or bring a complaint before the Dispute Settlement Body within the WTO . In any case, Russia's food policies constitute another dimension to its foreign policy and its relations with the United States. As has been shown, Russia's agricultural recovery and food policy strategy confront US policymakers with new challenges and choices about appropriate responses.

................................................................................................................................................................... 77 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 The new Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report from BMI forecasts that the country will account for 2% of Central and Eastern European regional oil demand by 2014, while providing 2% of supply. CEE regional oil use of 5mn barrels per day in 2001 rose to an estimated 5mn b/d in 2009. It should average 6mn b/d in 2010 and then rise to around 6mn b/d by 2014. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001 and averaged an estimated 13mn b/d in 2009. It is set to rise to 14mn b/d by 2014. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average 3mn b/d. This total had risen to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2009 and is forecast to reach 7mn b/d by 2014. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the key exporter. In terms of natural gas, the region consumed an estimated 668bn cubic metres in 2009, with demand of 780bcm targeted for 2014, representing 13% growth. Production of an estimated 830bcm in 2009 should reach 1,025bcm by 2014, which implies net exports rising from an estimated 162bcm in 2009 to 246bcm by the end of the period. Turkmenistans share of consumption in 2009 was an estimated 3%, while its share of production is put at 9%. By 2014, its share of demand is forecast to be 3%, with the country accounting for 10% of supply. We are sticking with our forecast that the OPEC basket of crudes will average US$83/bbl in 2010. Wide variations in crude differentials so far in 2010 make forecasting tricky for Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Urals, but we believe the three benchmarks will average around US$85, US$88and US$83/bbl respectively, with Dubai coming in at US$83. By 2011, there should be further growth in oil consumption and more room for OPEC to regain market share and reduce surplus capacity through higher production quotas. We are assuming a further increase in the OPEC basket price to an average US$85/bbl. For 2012 and beyond, we continue to use a central case forecast of US$90/bbl for the OPEC basket. For 2010, the BMI assumption for premium unleaded gasoline is an average global price of US$96/bbl. The year-on-year rise in 2010 gasoline prices is put at 38%. Gasoil is expected to average US$92/bbl in 2010, with the full-year outturn representing a 37% increase from the 2009 level. For jet fuel in 2010, the annual level is forecast to be US$95/bbl, compared with US$70/bbl in 2009. BMI puts the average naphtha price for 2010 at US$82/bbl, up 39% from the previous years level. Turkmen real GDP is assumed by BMI to have risen by 6% in 2009, followed by forecast 8% growth in 2010. We are assuming average annual growth of 9% in 2010-2014. Domestic consumption trends can be expected to return to a strong growth tack in 2010, estimated at an average of 5% per annum. By Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Executive Summary Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 2014, the country could be using 153,000b/d of oil. Turkmenistan has traditionally been protective of its onshore basins, allowing international oil companies to participate only in offshore developments. Offshore activity should help raise national crude and gas liquids output from an estimated 220,000b/d in 2009 to 375,000b/d by 2014. Gas production is expected to increase from an estimated 76bcm to 103bcm between 2009 and 2014. Between 2010 and 2019, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 53%, with volumes peaking at 400,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 369,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2019 is set to increase by 55%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 195,000b/d by 2019. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2009 level of 76bcm to 132bcm by 2019, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 56bcm to 90bcm. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Turkmenistan shares 11th place with Croatia in BMIs composite Business Environment ratings table, which combines Upstream and Downstream scores. It now shares eighth place with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated Upstream Business Environment Ratings, a fraction ahead of Slovakia. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further away from the foot of the table. Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs Downstream Business Environment Ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in joint 10th place, alongside Slovenia. Medium-term scope exists for Turkmenistan to challenge Hungary above it. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Turkmenistan Political SWOT Strengths ! Common strategic interests will smooth regional relations with Turkmenistan's energy-hungry neighbours such as China, and possibly even the EU. Weaknesses ! Despite growing discontent over increased repression and corruption, there is little prospect of an organised opposition gaining a foothold. Harsh methods will be used to suppress public protest, and multimillion-dollar contracts signed with Western companies will mute business support. Opportunities ! The stable transition of power after Saparmurat Niyazov's death is a positive sign of political stability. President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedovs early policies indicate that he may be willing to forge greater trade and business links with foreign countries. Threats ! Turkmenistan will remain one of the world's most restrictive societies, and with few of the benefits from increased hydrocarbon sales reaching the population, there remains some risk of civil uprising. Turkmenistan Economic SWOT Strengths ! Economic activity will be supported by the ongoing expansion of energy production and exports, ensuring strong growth in the medium term. ! The government's ambitious strategy for a fivefold increase in real GDP between 2000 and 2010 will encourage efforts to boost sustainability in all sectors of the economy. Weaknesses ! The official economic figures remain unreliable, reflecting the legacy of the Soviet era when only 'positive data' were released. With fiscal management opaque, international financial institutions will continue to find it hard to analyse and support Turkmenistan's economic development. ! The persistence of central planning, with government use of production targets and mandatory state procurement, will prevent efficient resource allocation, risking shortages of consumer goods, inflationary pressure and stunted growth. Opportunities ! A gas pipeline to China, currently under construction, will help diversify the country's export markets. Moreover, the country is also considering diversifying its gas export routes to Europe, bypassing Russia. ! The trade surplus provides an opportunity for the government to diversify the economy. Threats ! Trade levels will continue to fluctuate greatly while gas markets remain vulnerable to interruptions in pipeline access and external shocks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Turkmenistan Business Environment SWOT Strengths ! Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2009.! Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 7,940bcm, ranking it among the worlds top 5 countries. Weaknesses ! Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow have soured, following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan.! All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Opportunities ! Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. ! The country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential.! In May 2007, the chairman of state company Turkmengaz, Yashygeldy Kakayev, said the countrys energy strategy was to almost double gas production to 120bcm by 2010 and more than treble production to 240bcm by 2030. Threats ! Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many international oil companies had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. Some, however, have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 7,940bcm , ranking it among the worlds top five countries. The country contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya basin in the east, the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. In October 2008, UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates presented the first reserves estimates of the Osman-South Yolotan gas field. Speaking at a meeting of cabinet ministers in Ashgabat, GCA reportedly put the fields low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm, making it by far the countrys largest gas field and even ranking it among the worlds top-five gas fields. GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum productive capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. Companies from South Korea, the UAE and China have since been awarded US$9bn of contracts by the government to develop South Yolotan. These companies include China National Petroleum Corporation , LG International and Petrofac International. The contracts will include drilling and building gas processing plants in the Yolotan region. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. State-owned Turkmengaz hoped to have increased its production capacity to 100bcm per annum by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in October 2009. The source added that the output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The news Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Turkmenistan Energy Market Overview Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 suggests that Turkmenistan is looking beyond the end of its current dispute with Russia to the possibility of export deals that will require additional production capacity. Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 500-600mn bbl based on estimates by the BP Review and the December 2009 Oil & Gas Journal , although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2009. The government targets higher production, but the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals due to a shifting interest to gas production and lagging foreign investment. The country exports around half of its production. Local demand is estimated at 122,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. In February 2008, the president introduced a new fuels retail system providing transportation customers with free gasoline up to a specified level and charging a market rate, established by the state, for amounts exceeding the quota. Turkmenistan has two major refineries, the Seidi and Turkmenbashi, with a combined total capacity of 237,000b/d . Turkmenistans refinery system is under-utilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. In terms of electricity, Turkmenistans installed generating capacity is estimated at 3gigawatts , with recent generation put at around 15terawatt hours . With consumption averaging around 8TWh, there is a useful net export capability. Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energyis now owned by Italys Eni group. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 At least US$5bn per year over the next decade may need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg. CMX consultant Jennifer Coolige argued in the report that there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 In parallel with the cogitation at the International Energy Forum s end-March gathering in Mexico it was suggested that a price range of US$70-80/bbl for crude oil was pretty much perfect in the current and near-term environment. Many market participants apparently believe this level is high enough to deliver adequate producer-state revenues and project returns, but low enough to avoid further demand destruction and to keep out marginal production. If only it were that easy. OPEC ministers, who met earlier in March, might share the view expressed by the IEF in Cancn, but the group looks to be on the brink of virtually abandoning genuine production quotas for all but select core member states. Growing discord within the organisation reflects the impatience being shown by some countries keen to push ahead with field development and carve out a wider and deeper niche for themselves. Actual production is moving further and further away from the theoretical ceiling and there is a real danger of a mini-OPEC free-for-all. Fortunately, the big guns are generally remaining silent as the cartel grandees let the junior club members have their fun. The real test of unity can be avoided until oil prices come under pressure. Thanks to global demand recovery, threats to supply in various regions and the slow pace of non-OPEC expansion, there is little risk of a near-term confrontation that could tear OPEC apart. Other shadows are falling over the consumer market, as pump prices head ever higher. As fuel prices move close to, or even above, the highs seen in 2008, there will be trouble. Heavy handed use of fuel taxation as a bogus substitute for environmental policy means that most motorists, airlines and truck operators could this year face unprecedented fuel costs. With a fragile OECD economic recovery underway, there is a macroeconomic as well as an oil-specific threat. This represents the so-called double whammy, where demand is destroyed by high prices at the same time as economic activity stumbles. In the US, oil inventories have recently been heading ominously in the wrong direction, establishing an unhealthy surplus that has the potential to keep prices in check later in the year particularly if the gasoline season gets off to a slow start. Most third-party forecasters, including BMI, remain confident that demand and prices will hold up throughout 2010. However, the greater the price strength in Q2, the weaker demand may be in Q3 and Q4. None of this makes it necessary to review our existing central price assumptions but it does help reinforce our view that price progress beyond this years recovery may be subdued as the market struggles to find a balance. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Global Oil Market Outlook Is The Price Right? Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 We again stick with our forecast that the OPEC basket of crudes will average US$83/bbl in 2010. Wide variations in crude differentials so far in 2010 make forecasting tricky for Brent, WTI and Urals, but we believe the three benchmarks will average around US$85, US$88and US$83/bbl respectively, with Dubai coming in at US$83/bbl. In terms of the OPEC basket of crudes, the average price in Q110 was approximately US$75/bbl, up modestly from the US$74/bbl recorded during the previous three months. In Q109, the OPEC price averaged US$42/bbl, so the most recent quarter has seen a y-o-y gain of almost 76%. From the weekly average low of US$70/bbl in mid-February 2010, the OPEC basket climbed to a daily peak of US$82/bbl in early April. The monthly averages for the first three months of 2010 have been US$76, US$72and US$77/bbl. The early signs are that April will deliver an average close to US$80/bbl. Given that the unusually cold and disruptive winter will have provided unexpected price support, the prospects for Q2 might have looked a little shaky as temperatures rose and seasonal demand fell. Once again, the so-called Q2 demand trough appears unlikely to trigger a sustained fall in prices. In terms of other marker prices, North Sea Brent averaged US$76/bbl during Q1, with WTI achieving US$78, Urals at US$75/bbl and Dubai realising an average US$75/bbl. These averages have been calculated using OPEC data and monthly prices from the International Energy Agency . The BMI assumption for April 2010 OPEC crude is US$79/bbl and for the second quarter we are expecting an average of US$81/bbl, in spite of demand downside risk. This suggests an 8% strengthening of quarterly realisations when compared with Q110 and a y-o-y gain of US$23/bbl when compared with Q209 (+39%). As mentioned earlier, for 2010 as a whole, we continue to assume an average OPEC basket price of US$83/bbl (+36% y-o-y). This is the forecast introduced in our October 2009 quarterly report. The equivalent US WTI price is now put at US$88/bbl. The April 2010 monthly report from the US-based Energy Information Administration predicts a 2010 average WTI crude price of just under US$81/bbl, rising to US$83in 2011. BMI is assuming an OPEC basket price of US$85/bbl in 2011, with WTI averaging US$90. Our central assumption for 2012 and beyond is an OPEC price averaging US$90/bbl, delivering WTI at just under US$95/bbl. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Oil Price Forecasts Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 The BMI oil supply and demand assumptions for 2010 and beyond have once again been revised for all 71 countries forming part of our detailed coverage, reflecting the changing macroeconomic outlook and the impact of environmental initiatives. Investment in exploration, development and new production is once again rising as a result of higher crude prices, but not yet to the same level seen earlier in the decade. Costs associated with oil field development and exploration/appraisal drilling have begun to rise again, following the relief provided by the global recession. This may reduce the effectiveness of planned budget increases. For many companies, significant budget increases may be delayed until 2011 as they seek greater confidence in the macroeconomic picture and the trend in crude prices. We have made only modest changes to forecast oil production levels, in line with recent OPEC levels and known project delays, with no clear evidence so far of large-scale spending changes by IOCs or NOCs. According to the updated BMI model, 2010 global oil consumption will increase by 1% from the 2009 level. This represents a slight downgrade from the forecast contained in the January 2010 quarterly report, when 1% growth was predicted. The 2010 forecast represents slightly lower OECD demand and a revised non-OECD increase of 3%. The overall increase in demand is estimated at 1mn b/d. North America is expected to see expansion of just 70,000b/d , with OECD European demand set to recover by just 19,000b/d . Non-OECD gains are expected to be 2% in Asia, 1% in Latin America and 1% in Africa. The IEA, in its April 2010 Oil Market Report , predicts a more bullish rise in 2010 oil demand of 1%, or 1mn b/d. The organisations assumptions suggest an impressive 4% rise in non-OECD consumption (+1mn b/d). This points to 0% lower OECD oil demand, in spite of likely economic recovery and any weather-related benefits in Q1. April 2010 EIA estimates suggest that world demand will rise y-o-y from 84mn b/d to 85mn b/d, with the 1mn b/d increase in consumption amounting to a gain of 1%. This view sits neatly between the somewhat cautious BMI assumption and the IEAs more generous estimate. Non-OECD demand is predicted to increase by 3% , while OECD demand is expected to rise by just 30,000b/d . Consumption in the US is expected to increase by 150,000b/d . With Canadian demand 1% higher and European demand 0% lower, it is in Japan that the US energy body sees the greatest risk of a decline forecasting a fall of 3%. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Oil Supply, Demand And Price Outlook Short-Term Demand Outlook Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 OPECs April 2010 report suggests a likely increase in 2010 global oil consumption of 0mn b/d, or 1%. OECD demand is forecast to fall by 160,000b/d . Non-OECD demand is expected to average 39mn b/d, compared with 38mn b/d in 2009 (+2%).

Source: Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009/BMI. According to the revised BMI model, 2010 global oil production will rise by 1%, representing an OPEC increase of 2% and a non-OPEC gain of 1%. The overall increase in supply is estimated at 1mn b/d in 2010, which represents a slight upgrade from the forecast delivered in the January 2010 quarterly report. We continue to assume that the existing OPEC production ceiling will be retained for the whole of 2009, but that actual output will remain close to the early-2010 level. Should quota adherence deteriorate further, OPEC volumes could emerge rather higher. The US-based EIA was in April 2010 forecasting a 600,000b/d y-o-y rise in non-OPEC oil output, representing a gain of 1%. World oil production is predicted to be 85mn b/d in 2010, up from 84mn b/d (+1mn b/d) in 2009. The US organisation expects a 0mn b/d upturn in OPEC oil and NGL output. Given the aggressive stance of several OPEC producers, it would be no great surprise to see a significant upward revision to EIA assumptions. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Short-Term Supply Outlook Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 It is interesting to note that the EIAs assumption of US oil demand even in 2011 is lower than it was in 1999, and is 1mn b/d below the highest level of annual consumption, reached in 2005. OPEC itself sees 2010 non-OPEC supply rising by 500,000b/d to 51mn b/d. In 2010, OPEC natural gas liquids and non-conventional oils are expected to increase by 0mn b/d over the previous year to average 4mn b/d. The April 2010 OPEC monthly report argues that the call on OPEC crude is expected to average 28mn b/d, representing a downward adjustment of 135,000b/d from its previous assessment and a decline of 100,000b/d from the previous year. This suggests little scope for members to raise output. The IEAs 2010 assumption for non-OPEC oil supply is 52mn b/d, a rise of 1%. This somewhat cautious view is based on output declines in the US, Mexico, the UK and Norway, which will offset partly the growth predicted for Brazil, Russia, China, India and Colombia. OPEC production of gas liquids is expected to rise sharply from 4mn b/d to 5mn b/d. Increased biofuels supply (+20%) and a downturn in processing gains imply a need for OPEC crude volumes of 29mn b/d in 2010. This is very close to OPECs estimated Q110 output.

Source: Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009/BMI. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 The BMI model predicts average annual oil demand growth of 1% between 2010 and 2014, followed by 1% between 2014 and 2019. After the forecast 1% global demand recovery in 2010, we are assuming 2% growth in 2011, followed by 2% in 2012, 1% in 2013 and 1% in 2014. Growth is expected to be stronger in 2011-2013, before slowing once again as energy-saving initiatives take effect later in the forecast period. OECD oil demand growth is expected to remain relatively weak throughout the forecast period to 2019, reflecting market maturity, the ongoing effects of recent demand destruction, and the greater commitment to energy efficiency. Following the 3% decline in 2009 OECD oil consumption and the forecast 0% fall in 2010, we expect to see a rise of 0% in 2011. The upturn forecast for 2012-2014 delivers annual gains of 1%, 0% and 0% respectively. We expect growth trends to turn negative once again beyond 2014. On average, OECD demand is forecast to rise by 0% per annum in 2010-2014, then fall by 0% per annum in 2014-2019. For the non-OECD region, the demand trend in 2010-2014 is for 3% average annual market expansion, followed by 2% in 2014-2019. Demand growth is forecast to recover from 0% in 2009 to 3% in 2010 and 3% in 2011. BMI is forecasting global oil supply increasing by an average 1% per annum between 2010 and 2014, with an average yearly gain of 1% predicted in 2014-2019. We expect the trend to be at its weakest towards the end of the 10-year forecast period, with gains of just 1% and 0% predicted in 2018 and 2019. Non-OPEC oil production is expected to rise by an annual average of 0% in 2010-2014, then 0% in 2014-2019. OPEC volumes are forecast to increase by an annual average of 2% between 2010 and 2014, rising to 3% per annum in 2014-2019. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Longer-Term Supply And Demand Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 The OPEC basket price, having averaged an estimated US$75/bbl in Q110, is forecast to be US$81/bbl in Q2 and US$88/bbl in Q3. The full-year forecast remains an average of US$83/bbl. Brent, WTI and Urals prices for 2010 are put at US$85, US$88and US$83/bbl respectively.

By 2011, there should be further growth in oil consumption and more room for OPEC to regain market share and reduce surplus capacity through higher production quotas. We are assuming a further increase in the OPEC basket price to an average of US$85/bbl, implying Brent at US$87, WTI at US$90/bbl and Urals at US$85. For 2012 and beyond, we continue to use a central case forecast of US$90/bbl for the OPEC basket.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 Oil Price Assumptions Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 While Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the decade but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Russias gas deposits not only dominate regional supply but also represent the biggest single source for Western Europe. While consumer countries wish to diversify away from Russia, there are no other regional suppliers of note. LNG is not a major trade for the CEE region, although Russia began exporting gas in March 2009 from the Far Eastern Sakhalin projects into the Asia Pacific markets. Russian production surprised on the upside in 2009, with output fighting back after tax adjustments were introduced. The countrys supply had fallen in 2008, ending a strong growth trend that began in 2000. We see little risk of a downturn in 2010, but the year could emerge as the near-term peak in output at 10mn b/d. A decline to just over 10mn b/d is thought likely by 2013, before increased investment delivers extra volumes of Russian crude and supply rises towards 11mn b/d by 2016/2017. The other regional issue is the Caspian states and their ability to meet production and export targets. The ultimate long-term potential is in little doubt, but a mixture of technical, commercial and political factors looks set hold back the rate of supply expansion. Azerbaijan has a question mark over its ability to achieve and sustain the expected oil supply expansion. In 2009, the previously expected strong growth in output evaporated in the wake of persistent technical problems. No real progress is expected in 2010. Kazakhstans near-term output growth potential is also less certain thanks to technical issues and the Kashagan field dispute. While there are worries over the timing of Kashagan, it should still be a major contributor beyond the end of the forecast period. CEE oil production is now thought to have averaged 13mn b/d in 2009. The region's output is expected to be 13mn b/d in 2010 and to reach 14mn b/d by 2014. In terms of demand, the estimated 2009 average of 5mn b/d is set to recover to 6mn b/d by 2014. This means that net exports from the region will climb steadily, from an estimated 7mn b/d in 2009 to 7mn b/d by 2014.

Turkmenistan contributed an estimated 1% to 2009 regional oil production, with a market share of 2% expected by 2014. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average 3mn b/d. This total had risen to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2009 and is forecast to reach 7mn b/d by 2014.

Liquefied Natural Gas Table: Central/Eastern Europe LNG Exports/ Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 The CEE region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime. Oil production growth for the period to 2014 ranges from a negative 27% for Croatia to a positive 56% in Turkmenistan, while oil demand growth ranges from 6% to 31% across the region. Gas output is forecast to fall by 18% in Romania, but rise 55% in Azerbaijan. The range for forecast gas consumption growth is from 10% to 81%. The political and economic environment varies, depending partly on market maturity and EU membership. Business Environment Ranking Central/Eastern Europe Region Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Composite Business Environment scores are calculated using the average of individual Upstream and Downstream ratings. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan continue to dominate the top of the regional league table, taking first and second places with respective scores of 63 and 61 points out of a possible 100. Slovenia and Uzbekistan now share the final place in the rankings, with a composite upstream and downstream score of 43 points out of the 100 available. The points spread in the CEE region is considerably narrower than elsewhere, with the lowest-ranked country having 68% of the score allocated to the highest-ranked. Russia now shares third place with Poland, but with no immediate chance of catching the two main Central Asian energy powerhouse states. Turkey, included for the first time, is a challenger for Polands position, while Romania and Ukraine are closely matched just above the middle of the league table, ahead of Hungary and the Czech Republic with limited upstream resource potential. Slovakia and Croatia are struggling near the foot of the table, but should be able to stay in front of Slovenia and Uzbekistan.

Azerbaijan is second, itself having a very useful 14-point lead over Bulgaria. Turkmenistans hydrocarbons resources mean it has shifted further from the foot of the table, having caught up with Croatia and Hungary to share eighth place. Uzbekistan has also mounted a successful challenge for mid-table status. Bulgaria and Poland are tied in third place, ahead of Turkey and Russia in joint fifth place. Long term, Russia should be able to move higher, subject to an improved country risk and licensing/regulatory environment. Ukraine has the potential to challenge Slovakia for 13th place, and should be able to keep clear of bottom-ranked Slovenia.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Upstream Scores Limits of Potential Returns Risks to the Realisation of Potential Returns Upstream Market Country Structure Limits Industry Risks Country Risk Risks Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Turkmenistan now shares eighth place with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated Upstream Business Environment Ratings, a fraction ahead of Slovakia. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further away from the foot of the table. Upstream Market: On the basis of upstream data alone, Turkmenistan is actually the joint second most attractive state in the CEE region, alongside Russia. This reflects the fourth- and second-placed oil and gas reserves, the third-ranked oil production growth outlook, and fourth-placed gas production prospects. Country Structure: Contributing to Turkmenistans third highest position in the Limits to Potential Returns section is its unenviable country structure, which takes 13th place ahead only of Uzbekistan and Russia. The state has greater ownership of upstream assets than many in the region, and the industry is only somewhat competitive, with few non-state companies operational. Industry Risks: Turkmenistan is ranked second from last, only ahead of Russia in the Risks to Realisation of Potential Returns section of our ratings. Its joint 13th position for Industry Risks with Slovenia is due to its licensing environment, and the fact that there is little immediate chance of privatisation of state-held assets. Country Risks: Its broader country risk environment is the second least attractive in the region, ranked 14th ahead only of Uzbekistan. The best, and only respectable, score is for long-term policy continuity. Corruption is the key risk for private companies. Furthermore, their ability to operate is weakened by the countrys low-scoring physical infrastructure. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Potential Returns Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Risks To Potential Returns Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Russia and Bulgaria now bracket the remaining 13 CEE states in the downstream rankings, with Russia now challenged by second-placed Turkey, in spite of the size of the fuels market and refining capacity. Turkeys risk profile is substantially better and it may be able to challenge for regional leadership over the medium term. Poland is just a point further back and also a potential regional leader. Ukraine is now just one point behind Poland, but is unlikely to challenge it during the next few quarters. Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic and Romania are squabbling over fifth place, having edged ahead of Azerbaijan. Turkmenistan is now on the same score as Slovenia, and there is little to choose between Croatia, Slovakia and Uzbekistan near the foot of the table.

Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in joint 10th place, alongside Slovenia. Medium-term scope exists for Turkmenistan to challenge Hungary above it. Downstream Market: On the basis of downstream data alone, Turkmenistan ranks fifth among the regions 15 countries. This is attributable to the countrys ninth highest refining capacity, second highest gas demand growth outlook and joint third highest oil demand growth ranking. Country Structure: Turkmenistan ranks eighth in terms of the Limits to Potential Returns section, although its Country Structure holds last place in the region, behind even Uzbekistan. Growth in GDP per capita is the fifth highest for the entire region. Population ranks 11th and nominal GDP is the lowest in the region. Industry Risks: In the Risks to Realisation of Potential Returns section of our ratings, Turkmenistan is ranked 12th, just behind Uzbekistan. Its equal 11th place with Uzbekistan for Industry Risks reflects the challenging regulatory regime and the fact that there is little chance of near-term privatisation of government-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risk environment is ranked equal 12th, alongside Bulgaria and Romania. The scores for short-term economic external risk, legal framework and physical infrastructure let the country down badly, but it benefits from one of the regions higher scores for short-term policy continuity. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Potential Returns Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Risks To Potential Returns Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 On his first tour of the Central Asian region in April 2010, Secretary-General of the UN Ban Ki-moon pushed for Turkmenistan to improve its human rights record, stating that the UN would work more closely with the isolationist and authoritarian country in the future. Rights have somewhat improved under President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov recently, with the idea of allowing political opposition parties having been mooted in February. However, this has yet to be put into effect and the media continues to be repressed by the state. The EU continues with its plans to secure gas from Turkmenistan for the planned Nabucco pipeline. Indeed, according to the European Commissioner for Energy Gunther Oettinger, working groups have been set up between the EU and Turkmenistan to discuss the legal groundwork for the project. Should the project go ahead, it would further support Turkmenistan's strategy to diversify its export routes. The However, the benefits would not be realised until 2014 at the earliest. According to Deputy Turkmen Prime Minister Baymurad Khodjamukhamedov on April 14, Turkmenistan's largest gas field, South Iolotan, may hold up to 16tcm of gas reserves, up from a previous estimate of 14tcm. While this estimate has yet to be verified by independent sources, the field will provide substantial potential for foreign investment in the future, not only within the oil and gas sector but also for requisite infrastructure. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Risk Summary Political Economic Business Environment Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Statistical Review and the OGJ, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. We are assuming a very gradual decline in reserves as production rises, but with at least 570mn bbl remaining by 2014. Turkmenistan has proven gas reserves of approximately 7,940bcm . All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. We are forecasting an increase in gas reserves to at least 8,000bcm during the forecast period. UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates in October 2008 presented the first reserves estimates of the Osman-South Yolotan gas field. Speaking at a meeting of cabinet ministers in Ashgabat, GCA put the fields low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm, making it by far the countrys largest gas field and even ranking it among the worlds top five gas fields. GCA has also released results for the Yashlar field, located next to the Osman-South Yolotan field, with reserves estimates put at 250bcm , 675bcm and 1,500bcm . Turkmenistan made a large new gas condensate discovery in the Karakum desert in August 2008, according to state-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary. The fields reserves have not been revealed. A new onshore gas discovery at the Minara field was announced in late June 2009. According to a report in state news agency Turkmen Press, deep drilling at the mature Minara field produced positive results that could suggest large reserves. Tests on the first exploration well at the field, which was drilled to a depth of 4,030m, produced gas flow rates of 4mn cubic metres per day . Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Industry Forecast Scenario Oil And Gas Reserves Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Germany's RWE Dea has announced that it will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities in Turkmenistan's Block 23 between 2010 and 2014. Block 23 is an offshore gas block in the Turkmen sector of the Caspian Sea. During the initial four year exploration period, the company will carry out an environmental study, followed by a 3D seismic survey. After completing the processing and interpretation of the seismic data acquired, the company will drill one obligatory exploration well. Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, but is believed to have rebounded to 220,000b/d in 2009. The government is targeting higherproduction, but the oil sector is strugglingto meet its growth goals owing to ashifting interest to gas production andlagging foreign investment. According toreports in 2007, Turkmenistan aims toproduce 2mn b/d by 2030, which seems rather optimistic. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand is an estimated 122,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI is assuming 2010 oil production of 240,000b/d, rising to 375,000b/d by 2014 and continuing to increase steadily beyond this point, peaking in around 2015. Demand is forecast to increase from 122,000b/d to 153,000b/d by 2014, leaving export potential of up to 222,000b/d. Turkmenistan Oil Production, Consumption And Exports e/f = estimate/forecast. Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009; Forecasts BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Consultant GCA has said that it wouldrecommend the gradual development ofthe Osman-South Yolotan field,increasing production by 10bcm a year,with the maximum productive capacity atthe field estimated at 70bcm. While GCAhas not commented on how quickly thefield could be brought onstream, thesuggested output levels wouldsignificantly add to the countrysproduction volumes. Companies fromSouth Korea, the UAE and China havesince been awarded US$9bn ofcontracts by the government to developSouth Yolotan. These include CNPC, LGInternational and Petrofac International. The contracts will include drilling and building gas processing plants in the Yolotan region. Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm per annum by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in October 2009. The source said that the output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. Iran is hoping to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by end-2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency on April 23. Following the completion of the 155km second leg of the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline, Iran will be able to import up to 24bcm of Turkmen gas a year. The second leg of the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline will run from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The first leg of the pipeline, which starts at the Dauletabad field in Turkmenistan near the Iranian border, was completed in December 2009 and is currently capable of carrying up to 11bcm per annum. According to Kashkuli, the second phase is currently being built, with construction expected to be completed by year-end, brining the capacity to around 16bcm. He added that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Gazprom has contracted to transit only 10bcm of gas from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan in 2010, according to an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas. Under the terms of an agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat in December 2009, 30bcm were expected to be Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Gas Supply And Demand Turkmenistan Gas Production, Consumption And Exports e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009; Forecasts BMI Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. According to a Reuters report in April 2010, the lower gas export requirement could be due to weaker demand in Russia. Reuters also cited the head of KazTransGas subsidiary Intergas Central Asia, Serik Yestai, as saying that gas exports to Russia from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan would together total around 25bcm. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 76bcm in 2009 to 103bcm by 2014, with growth continuing beyond this point as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 20bcm to 29bcm during the period, so exports could reach 74bcm by 2014. Risk appears to be on the downside in terms of output forecasts, in spite of government predictions that call for volumes well in excess of those forecast by BMI. Turkmenistan has two refineries, one at Chardzou and the other at Turkmenbashi, with a combined capacity of 237,000b/d. However, Turkmenistans refinery system is under-utilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. Current BMI oil price assumptions are for an OPEC basket of US$83/bbl in 2010, followed by US$85/bbl in 2011, and an average US$90/bbl in 2012-2014. The picture for oil export revenues is therefore relatively bright. Turkmenistan should earn an estimated US$3bn in 2010, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$7bn by 2014. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2014 are US$25bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2014 total could be US$32bn, against an estimated US$23bn in 2010.

Source: Historical data, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2009. Forecasts, BMI The revenue picture painted above owes much to rising output and relatively high oil prices. There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise with the higher export volumes. At a flat US$50/bbl oil price from now until 2014, petroleum export revenues would rise to US$17bn. However, at a flat US$100/bbl, the export 2014 export revenues would be US$35bn. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Between 2010 and 2019, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 53%, with volumes peaking at 400,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 369,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2019 is set to increase by 55%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 195,000b/d by 2019.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Turkmenistan has two refineries with a total capacity of 237,000b/d. One at Chardzou, near the border with Uzbekistan, which has 120,493b/d capacity and another at Turkmenbashi, with a crude processing capacity of 116,477b/d. Turkmenistans refinery system is under-utilised, however, and throughput represents only about half of nameplate capacity. The countrys main oil storage depot at Zerger was expanded in 2006 from a capacity of 124,666 bbl to its current capacity of 161,332 bbl. Oil and oil products are exported from Turkmenistan by sea from the Kenar, Aladzha and Ekerem terminals. The throughput capacity of Kenar is 22mn bbl per year. The facility can accommodate tankers with a deadweight of up to 5,000 tonnes. The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year. The facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 tonnes deadweight. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. The Aladzha terminal has a throughput capacity of up to 17mn bbl of oil per year. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Pipeline In late May 2010, President Berdymukhamedov presided over a welding ceremony for the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Oil And Gas Infrastructure Oil Refineries Oil Storage Facilities Oil Terminals/Ports Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via the capital of Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum. The pipeline is seen as a vital part of eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. Turkmenistan-Iran Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009 by Turkmenistan's president Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and his Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline The second leg of the pipeline will run from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase is currently being built, with construction expected to be completed by year-end, brining the capacity to around 16bcm. He added that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Turkmenistan-China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 took part in the inauguration of the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline is expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. A second parallel pipeline is expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Central Asia-Center Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the Central Asia-Center pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India During his visit to Turkmenistan in November 2009, Eni's CEO Paolo Scaroni offered assistance to the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. The proposed TAPI pipeline would supply 32bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Officials from the governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a deal in Islamabad on April 24 2008 to buy gas from Turkmenistan. The mountainous terrain that the route would have to cross presents significant technical challenges, however, and the US-led war in Afghanistan means that the pipeline is a distant prospect. In May 2010, the governments of Turkmenistan and India reiterated their commitment to increased gas exports from Turkmenistan to India. However, no concrete commitment was made towards pursuing the TAPI pipeline as the political, security and technical challenges remain too much to overcome. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. Itera Turkmenistan-Russia Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Solid Growth Potential Over Long Term BMI View: The Turkmen economy will be a major growth outperformer through the long term. Having expanded by 6% in 2009, we forecast a return to double-digit economic growth by 2012, as the country's oil and gas sectors continue to diversify export routes and expand production on the back of a surge in foreign investment into the economy. Turkmenistan avoided the worst effects of the global economic recession by virtue of its relative economic isolation and limited integration with global capital markets. While production within the gas sector fell during the latter half of 2009 as a result of Russia's decision to halt imports in April, headline GDP growth of 6% was propped up by high levels of state investment within the construction and textiles industries. According to the State Agency for Statistics, construction and investment activities increased by 69% in 2009 compared with 2008. Energy Sector To Lead the Way Developments in the first few months of 2010 support our long-held view that the energy sector will help to drive economic growth back towards double-digit levels by 2012, making the country one of the fastest-growing economies in emerging Europe. Following an agreement reached between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22 2009, Russia resumed gas imports from Turkmenistan as of January 1 2010, a 10-year deal that is worth 30bcm per year. Furthermore, following the inauguration of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline on December 14, Turkmenistan will export up to 30bcm to China once full capacity becomes available by 2012. Over the long run, China has the potential to overtake Russia to become the largest importer of Turkmen gas. With export routes being expanded to Iran in 2010, we stress that the diversification of the country's export routes will be key for sustaining robust growth. There has also been increased foreign interest in Turkmenistan's huge natural resource stock as the government has continued to express interest in luring foreign investors into the economy. Indeed, 2009 and 2010 have seen a flurry of investment activity. A consortium of firms from China, South Korea and the UAE won US$9bn worth of government contracts to develop onshore oil deposits, while on February 5 2010, a host of European firms, including French energy giant GDF Suez, were awarded contracts worth EUR2bn to upgrade and expand the country's power grid. We believe this trend will continue as the global economic recovery continues and the appetite for large-scale investments continues to pick up. Not only will investment help to boost energy production and exports, foreign expertise will be invaluable for updating the country's ageing infrastructure, which currently acts as a limiting factor on the economy's ability to sustain strong growth. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Macroeconomic Outlook Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Is There A Risk From Overdependence? Beyond the energy sector, Turkmenistan's secondary and tertiary sectors remain comparatively underdeveloped. While the government has made overtures in early 2010 towards opening up other sectors of the economy to foreign investment, we believe that the allure of revenues from oil and gas will keep the government's attention firmly on growth within the energy sector. Indeed, based on forecasts of production and commodity prices, BMI's oil and gas team calculates that the value of Turkmen oil and gas exports will rise from US$3bn and US$19bn to US$7bn and US$26bn respectively over 2010-2015.

IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. ! Petronas began producing from the Diyarbekir field in 2006. Petronas production increased from 4,700b/d of oil in the financial year ending March 31 2008 to 6,400b/d in FY08-09. ! In February 2008, Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2009, Eni produced an average 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2008. ! The largest minority investor in oil explorer Dragon Oil has rejected a takeover bid from controlling shareholder ENOC that valued Dragon at US$3bn. Baillie Gifford & Co said in a statement emailed in November 2009 that the offer materially understates the fundamental and strategic value of Turkmenistan-focused Dragon. In 2008, Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea.

Source: BMI Licensing And Regulation In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been production sharing agreements . The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energy, now owned by Italys Eni, produced an average 12,000b/d in 2009. Petronas of Malaysia in 2006 began producing from the Diyarbekir field, with average production of 6,400b/d in FY08-09. Output from the offshore Cheleken block operated by Dragon Oil and Turkmenneft averaged 44,765b/d in 2008. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Table: Key Domestic And Foreign Companies 2009 Sales % share of total sales No. of employees Year Company Overview/State Role Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Government Policy President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn in hydrocarbons sector investment by 2010, but this unlikely. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI levels at US$753mn. At least US$5bn per year over the next decade may need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMX consultant Jennifer Coolige argued in the report that there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under President Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be opening up under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. International Energy Relations Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010, an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has been aggressively pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 In 2008 Russia paid US$140 per thousand cubic metres for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May. During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late 2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010 Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. The pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by President Berdymukhamedov to Tehran on February 14, 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 took part in the inauguration of the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline is expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. A second parallel pipeline is expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for EU External Relations Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with state-owned Turkmengaz in H110. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He added that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 India and Turkmenistan have agreed to step up energy cooperation after high level discussions during Turkmen president Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's first visit to India. The two sides expressed interest in several projects to transport Turkmen gas to India, including the long-mooted TAPI pipeline. However, BMI sees the political, security and technical challenges to the project as overwhelming making a gas-swap deal with Iran a more likely option.

In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov.

In January 2008, Reuters reported that Eni had secured 77% of Burren in an agreed GBP1bn bid and Eni finalised the transaction on February 29. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In 2007, Burren expected to produce 1mn tonnes of crude, equal to about 22,643b/d, up from around 20,000b/d in 2006. In the first half of August 2007, Burren produced 23,400b/d, compared with an average 21,800b/d in H107. In its latest annual report, Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2008. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Latest Developments Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. In April 2008, Turkmenistan refused to issue entry visas to Enis managers, illustrating the governments irritation that it was not consulted about Enis takeover of Burrens assets. However, operations are said Business Monitor International Ltd Page 55 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 to be continuing as normal as former Burren employees that are now working for Eni are allowed to continue to travel in and out of the country, according to an Eni spokesperson. In August 2007, Burren announced record results from a new appraisal well in an undeveloped part of the Burun field. The Burun well B063 discovered 60m of net pay in the south-west of the field. The well flowed at a test rate of 2,200b/d, the highest flow rate of any Burun well. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 56 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies currently active in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Substantial domestic oil producer Strong relationship with government Early entrance into and established position in market Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Lack of developed infrastructure Opportunities: Rise in regional oil and gas consumption Long-term export opportunities Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address !

The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of eight-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early 2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rose to 32,000b/d in 2007, 40,038b/d in 2008 and a record of 44,765b/d in 2009. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, down US$100mn from the 2009-2011 period, The company plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including 5 appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% on average over the period. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Latest Developments In mid-May 2010, Dragon Oil issued details of contracts it had awarded to construct two rig platforms in its Cheleken contract area, in the Turkmen waters of the Caspian Sea. The company believes that the platforms, which will allow the drilling of up 16 new wells, will help the company achieve its production targets. The Dzhygalybeg A platform, to be built by Q112, will support a land rig and a jack-up rig and will allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Zhdanov field. The Dzheitune C platform, to be built by Q411, will support a jack-up rig and allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Lam Field. In April 2010, Dragon Oil announced that it had reached an agreement with a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company on a new short-term deal to replace a crude oil swap agreement that expired on 31 March 2010. The swap deal signed with NIOC subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company involves Dragon exporting its Turkmen crude to the Iranian Caspian port of Bandar Neka, where it is then marketed locally. In exchange, NIOC allocates Iranian crude oil to Dragon at the Kharg Island terminal, located in the Persian Gulf. Dragon Oil increased its 2009 full-year production by 9% to 44,765b/d of oil. The company put eight development wells into production in 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 58 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 ENOCs takeover of Dragon Oil has come up against an obstacle, with Dragon's largest minority shareholder rejecting the GBP4/share offer. Baillie Gifford & Co issued a statement on November 11 2009 claiming that the offer materially understates the fundamental and strategic value of Dragon Oil. Baillie Giffords clients holdings under its management amount to around 4% of the currently issued stock of Dragon, which is already 52% owned by ENOC. In August 2009, Dragon Oil released production test results from its Dzheitune 13/135 development well. The well was drilled to a depth of 3,302m and produced an initial flow rate of 1,320b/d of oil, which was slightly below Dragons expectations. The company said flows would improve, however, as the pressures in the gas-bearing zones are normalised. Dragon Oil has now moved Rig 40 to Slot 5 on the Dzheitune 13 platform where it is drilling the Dzheitune 13/138 development well. Dragons crude output averaged around 42,800b/d in H109, up around 11% from H108, but below its original expectations owing to changes in its drilling programme and operational problems. Dragon Oil confirmed in June 2009 that it has received a preliminary takeover offer from an unnamed party, according to Reuters. The news agency reported that sources familiar with the situation believe that ENOC is the bidder. No details over the bid approach have been released. In June 2009, Dragon announced that it has successfully completed drilling the Dzheitune 28/134 development well, which was drilled to a total depth of 3,280m, using the Iran Khazar jackup rig. This well produced initial flow test rates of 2,685b/d and 869b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. In May 2009, Dragon Oil announced that it has completed testing its Dzheitune 13/133A development well, which is also located in Turkmenistans sector of the Caspian Sea. According to a company statement, the well produced flow test rates of 1,488b/d and 1,140b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. In early 2009, Dragon announced that it exceeded its 2008 production target producing an average of 40,992b/d. In July 2008, Dragon released a drilling update on its activities in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. The Dzheitune-22/128 development well was drilled to a depth of 3,848m and produced combined test flows of 2,600b/d of oil, according to a statement released to the Regulatory News Service. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 59 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has told the Turkmen government that it could be producing up to 5bcm of gas from Block 1, with production expected to be increased to 10bcm at a later stage. Currently only oil is produced from the field. President Berdymukhamedov met Petronas president Hassan Marican on May 15 2009 to discuss the companys Turkmenistan activities, according to Reuters. Petronas estimates that the field has 150bcm of reserves. In June 2009 Petronas said it would start installation work at Block 1 in early 2010. The facilities at the block will include a drilling platform, a wellhead platform and offshore pipelines. Offshore contractor Sigur Ros has signed a letter of intent to supply the crew and equipment required for the pipe laying work. First gas from the first phase of the block is scheduled for Q310. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. PetroChina said in early September 2009 that it would pay US$1bn to its parent company CNPC for its share of the Amu Darya Right Bank gas field in Turkmenistan. The field, which is scheduled to come onstream by the end of 2009, is earmarked to supply the second West-East gas pipeline that will transport gas to Shanghai. Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have Business Monitor International Ltd Page 60 Petronas Summary China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Gazprom Summary Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. In April 2003, the Russian and Turkmen presidents signed a bilateral cooperation agreement covering natural gas, which will remain in force from January 1 2004 until December 31 2028. Within the deal, state-controlled Turkmenneftegaz agreed a contract for the supply of Turkmen natural gas over the same period. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal on September 13 2009 with Turkmenistan to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which have been tense since April following an explosion on Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite its dispute with Gazprom. Discussions on the project had been ongoing since February 18. By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for 16 years and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman Igor Makarov, this is the first time the company has been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Preliminary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 61 Itera Summary Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas per year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April when RWEs CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistans President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which has been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3D seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. The company in April 2010 said it would invest US$60-80mn at the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil has returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010 in response to earlier media reports. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Canadian-registered independent Buried Hill Energy claimed that it signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 RWE Summary Others Summary Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan, confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 63 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 A strengthening of the 2010-2014 oil demand trend is predicted for the 2014-2019 period, reflecting the economic weakness prevailing in the earlier period, as well as the under-developed nature of several key economies, ongoing wealth generation thanks to rising export volumes, plus the maturing of new EU member states. The regions oil consumption is expected to increase by 13% in 2014-2019, after 11% growth in the period 2010-2014. Over the extended 2010 to 2019 forecast period, Azerbaijan leads the way, with oil demand increasing by an estimated 83%, followed by Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (+55%) and Kazakhstans 53% growth. Poland lags the field, as a result of greater market maturity and the lack of hydrocarbons income that stimulates economies elsewhere in the region.

Kazakhstan is by far the biggest contributor to growth, with output forecast to rise by 44% between 2010 and 2019. Turkmenistan exceeds it in percentage terms (+53%), but is a much smaller absolute contributor. Russia has the weakest production trend among the major producers, with a likely 6% gain between 2010 and 2019.

Cheap and plentiful local crude supplies help make it a region of choice for refinery investment, although government control of the downstream industry will need to be eased. Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, Turkey and Bulgaria have particularly ambitious expansion plans, reflecting either crude output growth or local demand expansion.

Between 2010 and 2019, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 53%, with volumes peaking at 400,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 369,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2019 is set to increase by 55%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 195,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 68 Regional Gas Supply Turkmenistan Country Overview Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 by 2019. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2009 level of 76bcm to 132bcm by 2019, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 56bcm to 90bcm. In terms of oil and gas supply, as well as refining capacity, the projections are wherever possible based on known development projects, committed investment plans or stated government/company intentions. A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historical reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

Our approach has been threefold. First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all 16 industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline Oil & Gas BER is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of Upstream/Downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients, who will have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite for their operations. Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% Upstream BER and 50% Downstream BER: Upstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Upstream rating which is composed of limits/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Downstream rating which comprises limits/risks . Both the Upstream BER and Downstream BER are composed of Limits/Risks sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader Country Risk components: Limits of Potential Returns: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Business Monitor International Ltd Page 71 Oil And Gas Ratings: Revised Methodology Introduction Ratings Overview Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 Risks to Realisation of those Returns: Evaluates both Industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Rule of Law Legal Framework Physical Infrastructure Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 75 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 BMI's industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 76 BMI Methodology How we generate our industry forecasts Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q3 2010 There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy Supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: ! national energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; ! company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; ! international quotas, guidelines and projections, such as OPEC, IEA, US Energy Information Administration . Energy Consumption A mixture of methods is used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: ! underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historical relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption ! government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand ! third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC ! extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts, based on company- or state-specific investment levels Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third-party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Sources include those international bodies mentioned above, such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news agencies.

However, the depth of the countrys economic crisis in 2009 and the slow pace of economic recovery will mean it could take until at least 2012 for the sector to return to 2008 levels of production. The contraction in Ukraines petrochemicals industry in 2009 came in the context of a 15% fall in real GDP. Though the recession is broad-based, with trade, consumption and investment indicators all continuing to decline in year-on-year terms, the ongoing collapse in gross fixed capital formation and household consumption were particularly pronounced. This impacted negatively on the key petrochemicals consuming industries, such as construction, consumer goods manufacturing and the automotive industry. Construction was the hardest hit sector, falling by around a half. Even the fertiliser segment, which is traditionally more stable than other major petrochemical consumers such as the automotive and construction industries reported a massive decline in production volumes, despite modest growth in agriculture. In the period of January-November 2009, production of plastic in primary forms totalled 279,500 tonnes, down by 32% y-o-y. Monthly output reached a peak of 30,300 tonnes in October , while November production was 27,700 tonnes . Although growth was largely the result of a low comparison base, it was favourable compared to overall industrial performance, which saw 6% y-oy decline in October. This indicated that the petrochemicals sector was entering into an earlier stage than the rest of Ukraines industrial sector, albeit due primarily to the restocking which had to occur following inventory depletion. Overall chemical and petrochemical production was down 23% y-o-y in 2009, with chemicals output down 22% and output rubber and plastic products down 24%. While the Ukrainian petrochemicals industry is not expected to contract any further, due to the depth of the decline, it will take until at least 2012 before it reaches 2008 levels. BMI forecasts plastics output of 365,000 tonnes in 2010, up by around 17% over 2009 levels. Although growth will be strong, it is largely due to base effects. Output will still be 16% down on 2008 levels, and the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector will be operating at around 70% capacity which is well below the 80-85% level which BMI regards to be the break-even point for the industry. The economy will begin a modest recovery in 2010, with GDP real growth at just 1%, with higher rates of growth in subsequent years. The petrochemicals industry should receive a boost in the 2010-12 period as a result of the construction and other activity related to the countrys joint hosting of the UEFA football championships. A diversification in markets and feedstock sourcing to remove the industrys dependence on domestic and Russian demand would enhance Ukraines petrochemical prospects. However, the outlook for Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Executive Summary Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 petrochemicals exports is bleak with the Russian, Turkish and EU markets also set to see sharp declines in demand. With the kind of economic growth rates seen in 2000-2007 unlikely to be repeated, the petrochemicals industry will be more heavily reliant on export markets. The depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia may provide some slight relief in terms of competitiveness, but equally it raises the cost of feedstock; which has to be passed on to the consumer or simply absorbed by the industry which is already financially precarious. If the demand does not exist, then depreciation is unlikely to make a significant difference. Russian economic growth is not likely to be remarkable over the forecast period, and the market is at risk of going into over-capacity owing to additional planned capacity being due to come online. Consequently, Ukrainian producers will be more reliant on the eurozone for sales. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Ukraine Petrochemicals Industry SWOT Strengths The industry is a strong refining segment made up of six oil refineries with a combined capacity of over 1mn barrels per day . The industry has attracted foreign investment and the backing of major Russian oil and gas entities, Lukoil and TNK-BP Weaknesses Ukraine is a net oil and gas importer, and is likely to become increasingly reliant on imports which, in turn, look increasingly unreliable in light of the major Russia- Ukraine gas dispute in early 2009. The nation has suffered from a shortage of raw materials and an outdated asset base, where investment has been severely neglected. Opportunities Investments by KarpatNaftoKhim could significantly increase Ukraines petrochemicals capacity, but their completion remains threatened by the economic downturn. Threats The countrys bureaucratic environment could offer considerable resistance to the privatisation and consolidation of the industry. Further gas disputes with Russia could threaten the survival of the petrochemicals industry. Ukraine Political SWOT Strengths A gradual improvement in bilateral relations with Russia bodes well for short-term stability; particularly should if it serve to lessen the possibility of previous flashpoints of instability such as disagreements over Kiev's NATO accession aspirations and the presence of Moscow's Black Sea Fleet in Crimea escalating into full-blown crises. Weaknesses Ukraine has little experience of party-based politics, leading to difficulties in forming coherent and stable parliamentary majorities, and to weak government policymaking capability. Much of Ukraines post-independence period has been characterised by economic mismanagement, corruption and cronyism. Western concerns over the countrys democratic credentials have hampered relations between the West and Ukraine. Opportunities With WTO membership secured, the pro-Western government may improve Ukraines prospects of a more formal trade arrangement with the EU. Threats Infighting among members of the governing Orange alliance continues to impede the government's ability to respond to the plethora of macroeconomic and financial market challenges. Yushchenko's lame-duck presidency and the persisting influence of Yanukovich's Party of Regions in parliament spell more bad news for Ukraine's floundering NATO and EU membership bids. This need not, however, prevent progress in forging closer economic ties with the EU. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 SWOT Analysis Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Ukraine Economic SWOT Strengths The extension of a US$16bn emergency stand-by agreement from the IMF has significantly reduced the likelihood of a sovereign credit default event. Multilateral loans will be crucial in maintaining macroeconomic stability through the medium term. Weaknesses On the heels of the continuing deterioration in external credit conditions, and in addition to the demand destruction taking place throughout Europe, Ukraine's economy is poised for a significant slowdown through the medium term. Opportunities The increasing likelihood of the more pro-Moscow Party of Regions making significant gains in the next parliamentary election could lead to a significant easing in tensions between Ukraine and Moscow, which should bode well for future bilateral negotiations over natural gas. Ukraine joined the WTO in 2008, which should help boost the country's export sector in coming years. Threats Ukraine's privatisation programmes may be stalled further by a Tymoshenko or Yanukovych-led government, with the new prime minister remaining suspicious of earlier sales of state assets. Ukraine Business Environment SWOT Strengths At an estimated 46mn, Ukraine has the largest population in the region after Russia. Weaknesses Although growing, disposable household income remains low. Corruption remains a serious problem in Ukraine, with the country ranking 118 out of 179 rated countries in the latest Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. Opportunities Protectionism in key markets such as the US and EU has been particularly high on those products such as metals and grain where Ukraine has a comparative advantage. Accession to the WTO would put the country in a better position to defend itself against accusations of dumping over the long term. Threats Government economic policy is likely to remain politically motivated as parliamentary factions continue to compete for control and influence. President Yushchenko also remains reluctant to float Ukraines exchange rate, which remains pegged to a weak US dollar. Transparency, such as in the conduct of privatisations, will remain largely elusive.

Source: BMI BMI estimates that total global ethylene capacity amounted to around 132mn tpa in 2008, with Asia Pacific representing 32% of installed capacity and North America 25%. Although the Middle East and Africa arethe largest source of oil and gas, theregion contributed just 17% of totalcapacity. This is set to change over themedium to long term as new capacitycomes online, with global capacity set toreach 174mn tpa in 2014. The regions contribution to global capacity is forecast to rise from 11% in Ethylene Capacities By Region 2009 Estimate Asia-Pacific Western Europe Eastern Europe 5% Middle East and Africa China South America NAFTA 26% Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 2007 to 23% by 2014. This would be an increase of nearly one-third over 2009 levels, but is a downward revision of around 7mn tpa from our previous estimates, reflecting the impact of the recession and the financial crisis on some projects, particularly in Asia. Gulf countries are expected to account for around 20% of the worlds ethylene production by 2010 compared to the current 8%. Some 50% of all new ethylene projects being developed in the world are located in the region. Saudi Arabia represents around 63% of total investment in the region, while Qatar comes second, with a 14% share. The Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association has forecast that the region will account for 40% of total global petrochemical production within 10 years, but has also warned that this would bring fresh challenges to the regions producers in terms of the need to secure more feedstock. The upside of the economic slowdown isthe halt and in some cases decline in thecost of petrochemicals plant construction,which had accelerated rapidly from 2002to 2008 amid a construction boom in theGulf region. A scarcity of raw materials,labour and engineering expertise hasplagued the Gulf petrochemicalsindustry, leading to project scheduleslippages. Some olefins complexes haveseen costs increasing by nearly four-foldfrom 2002. A downturn in constructionhas freed up resources and given thepetrochemical industry more negotiating leverage over costs of planned projects. On the downside, there is a danger in over-reliance on Asian markets, where growth is moderating as they expand their own domestic petrochemicals capacities, contributing to the risk of global over-capacity. The greatest uncertainties come from China, which is massively expanding capacity in 2010-2012, potentially leading to a decline in cracker operating rates to 80-85%, which is widely regarded as the break-even point for most petrochemicals producers. Gulf producers will be hoping that capacities in Europe and North America are crowded out of the market in order to provide further export opportunities. China should see its share of the global total rise by 2percentage points , but the rest of the Asia Pacific region will only see a 0pp increase. Another region set to raise its global profile is South America, with significant new capacity set to come online in Brazil and Venezuela. Brazilian petrochemicals giant Braskem is seeking to dominate production in the region and become a serious player on the international petrochemicals market. The company is ramping up capacity, including a world-scale ethylene joint venture with Pequiven in Venezuela. South Americas share of the global total should rise from 3% to 5% due to an increase in capacity totalling 4mn tpa. However, the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Ethylene Capacities By Region 2014 Forecast Asia- Pacific (excl. China) Western Europe Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa China South America 5% NAFTA 19% Source: BMI Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 economic downturn led to a revision of investment programmes in South America with the JV to be delayed by two years to 2013-2014. Dow Chemical and Petrobras have also moved back their planned petrochemical projects by one year, to 2012 and 2013, respectively. Feedstock Issues With Saudi Arabia, and Qatar in particular, ramping up capacities with a number of world-scale projects, the feedstock will also shift. At present, naphtha represents 54% of feedstock for the worlds crackers, with ethane providing a further 28%. BMI forecasts that by 2014 ethane will represent around 45% of total feedstock, derived largely from the gas fields in the Arabian Gulf. Access to cheap feedstocks gives petrochemicals companies in the Arabian Peninsula and Iran an even greater cost advantage over producers elsewhere in the world, particularly in Europe and North America. Higher oil prices have led governments in the region to reinvest profits in constructing petrochemicals plants. By 2014 the Middle East and Africa will have more than twice the capacity of Western Europe. Saudi Arabia accounts for almost half the US$250bn committed to petrochemicals projects in the Middle East, excluding Iran. Due to this strong growth in capacity in the Gulf region, investors will be reluctant to expand capacity in North America and Western Europe. Even de-bottlenecking expansions could be abandoned due to concerns about feedstock costs and loss of competitiveness. An increased use of ethane and expansion of capacity should help raise margins. Ethane costs just over a third of the cost of naphtha and cracking margins are 6% higher. Naphtha prices have risen in line with crude, which was reaching all-time highs by mid-2008. This caused ethylene contract prices to soar to over USc70 per pound in July 2008, a 47% y-o-y increase. Average oil prices of US$60 per barrel or above make the Middle East the prime destination for investment, due to access to low-cost ethane. However, the sharp decline in oil prices towards the end of 2008 and into 2009 should give naphtha-fed crackers a boost in competitiveness. Impact Of The Global Slowdown The global slowdown is a cause for concern for the petrochemicals industry, which is carrying out large-scale capacity additions in 2009 and 2010, leading to a supply glut. Middle Eastern producers will be particularly affected as they are heavily reliant on exports, particularly to Asia. Saudi Arabian projects are already being delayed due to a lack of buyers for their products as well as the global financial crunch, although this is expected to be a short-term phenomenon. In the long term, with Middle Eastern capacity growth rising faster than Chinese import growth, producers are likely to reduce operating rates. In 2008, significant parts of Chinas polyolefins market were stagnating, and the situation was set to deteriorate further over 2009, putting pressure on olefins prices. Chinese ethylene self-sufficiency could top 60% by 2010, compared to 45% in 2006. The falling price of naphtha feedstock will also undermine the competitive advantage ethane-fed crackers in the Middle East rely on to penetrate new markets. The downturn is not likely to last beyond 2010, as Chinese demand is likely to accelerate, with a supply gap Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 exceeding 15bn tpa by 2020. Meanwhile, Chinese crackers are expected to struggle to find competitively priced sources of naphtha, bolstering the penetration of Middle Eastern producers in Asian markets. Global olefins demand fell in 2008 due to the impact of the financial crisis from September of that year on consumer confidence. The situation was exacerbated by destocking throughout all petrochemicals product chains. Olefins demand fell by 3-4% in 2008 and growth in 2009 was largely flat. While a recovery is forecast from 2010, substantial new capacity is due to come onstream in the Middle East, taking advantage of low feedstock costs, and Asia. This is likely to keep crackers in the developed economies running at around break-even or even a loss. BMI estimates that in these markets cracker need to operate at 80-85% in order to break even. As a result, there is a distinct likelihood of ethylene capacity closures in the US and Europe over coming years with smaller units most likely to get axed. Table: World Petrochemicals Capacities, 2009 Product Capacity Ethylene 132,020 Propylene 79,870 Butadiene 12,620 High-density polyethylene 26,740 Low-density polyethylene 21,055 Linear low-density polyethylene 32,055 Polyethylene terephthalate 20,345 Polypropylene 52,320 Polyvinyl chloride 42,240 Polystyrene 12,000 Methanol 66,350 Ammonia 145,180 Urea 133,000 Source: BMI Cracker utilisation rates will be determined by demand for downstream producers. Around 60-65% of ethylene is used in the production of polyethylene , which is used in the production of film, packaging, household goods, containers, bags and pipes. A further 20-25% is used in the production of ethylene oxide , most of which is used to make ethylene glycol , the feedstock for polyethylene terephthalate or polyester as well as anti-freeze. The chlorination of ethylene produces ethylene dichloride , which is used to produce vinyl chloride monomer , the feedstock for polyvinyl Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 chloride , a polymer that is widely used in construction. Ethylbenzene , the feedstock for styrene monomer which produces polystyrene , acylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and styrene butadiene rubber is manufactured by reacting ethylene with benzene. Global PE demand has been reasonably strong and growing ahead of GDP in most countries, including the US. The construction of new crackers in the Middle East is being accompanied by new export-oriented PE plants in the region, which benefit from access to competitively priced feedstock. High growth Asian markets such as China are also set to witness a rise in capacity along the product chain, helping them become more self-sufficient, competitive and bolstering growth in exports across the product chain. As substantial amounts of new capacity are coming onstream in emerging markets at a time of poor demand, PE producers in developed markets will be under pressure to reduce prices and less competitive plants are likely to close. Polyethylene Performance has varied across PE products, with linear low-density polyethylene steadily eroding low density polyethylene market share as it allows lower gauges that can reduce costs for many applications while retaining tensile strength. The global market for LDPE is in a state of existential decline with the global recession simply hastening the trend and closure of plants in developed markets are inevitable as LLDPE plants replace them in the emerging markets. Meanwhile, HDPE has continued to exhibit strong growth, albeit at a slower rate than LLDPE. By 2009, LLDPE accounted for 40% of global PE capacity, followed by HDPE and LDPE . However, the PE market was hit hard by the financial crisis and its resulting impact on the economy. Polymer prices have plummeted as demand has diminished, purchasers withdrew from the market and producers destocked throughout the value chain. Consequently, just asdemand growth had exceeded GDPgrowth during the good times, the declinewas sharper than the contraction inoverall demand, falling by as much as20% in 2009. Polyvinyl Chloride Up to 75% of PVC consumption istypically used in the constructionindustry, which means the PVC industryis heavily influenced by broadereconomic trends. The collapse in thehousing market in many developedmarkets as well as a rapid slowdown in construction in China and the Middle East from H208 has Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Global PE Capacities By Product 2009 Estimate HDPE LLDPE 41% Source: BMI LDPE Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 therefore dealt a severe blow to PVC producers with BMI expecting the closure of smaller plants and consolidation due to a sustained slump in the market. On top of high chlorine prices and in the face of a rapid growth in Chinese output, BMI warns that many PVC plants will operate at below capacity in the medium term, and at a loss due to global over-capacity. Polystyrene In the PS segment, the rising price of benzene in line with rising oil prices has raised the cost of production, while rising capacity has put pressure on PS prices. Global PS demand totalled 10mn tones in 2008, while capacity was just under 12mn tpa, with over-capacity around 10%. The situation has worsened as a result of the financial crisis and economic recession, despite an easing of oil prices since mid-2008. Up to 3mn tpa of PS capacity could come onstream in the next five years with most capacity due to come onstream in China. Due to rising prices, PS faces increasing competition with PP, although at the same time it has gained market share from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene . The main growth market is in building insulation. In developed markets, PS capacity has been steadily cut over the past decade and there are few plans for new capacity over the medium-term. If oil prices fall to low levels, naphtha cracking rates could increase, thereby increasing benzene availability pushing down costs. Polyethylene Terephthalate PET is manufactured through the esterification reaction between purified terephthalic acid and monoethylene glycol which create a basic ester that is polymerized, extruded, cut into chips and then processed to form the PET resin. Nearly all PTA output and around half of MEG is devoted to PET production. As such, the performance of the PET market directly affects PTA production. More than 60% of PET is used for the production of synthetic fibres, known commonly as polyester, with most of the rest is used for bottle production. As a fibre, PET is used in clothing, tyre manufacturing and textiles. As a light-weight, strong and clear plastic, PET bottle resin has grown in importance. PET film is used in electronics and packaging. Global demand growth is being led by China, which is ramping up capacities in order to remain self-sufficient. BMI estimated the global PET market at around 30mn tonnes in 2008 and could reach up to 40mn tonnes by 2015, by which time the Chinese market could represent two-thirds of global polyester consumption, compared to around half in 2005. According to BMIs projections, global PET production capacity is set to rise from 20mn tpa in 2008 to 30mn tpa by 2015, mostly in China, an increase of more than 50%. However, we also project that demand will rise by only one-third over the same period, leading to a threat of over-capacity in a market that is already close to saturation. The growth in Asian capacity is a particular concern, with low-cost Chinese producers likely to sell their excess production on the global market, thereby depressing prices. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Polypropylene BMI estimates that global PP capacity totalled 53mn tpa in 2009, with the US as the worlds largest PP producer, with 17% of capacity, followed by China with 13%. Western European producing markets contributed 19%, while the Middle East despite its immense resources represented just 8%. BMI research indicates that the global landscape is set to radically shift over the next five years as demand and supply shift eastwards due to growth in developed markets. Global demand for PP has been running on average at 7% over the past decade, well above global average economic growth. BMI estimates global PP demand at 48mn tonnes in 2008, while global PP capacity was around 52mn tpa, giving a total capacity utilisation rate of 92%. As with all petrochemicals commodities, the level of growth in China and India has been largely responsible for the pace of PP demand growth. However, rising PP prices mean they are catching up with PE prices, leading to a slackening in demand growth momentum. Nevertheless, PP consumption is set to exceed 50mn tonnes in 2010 and could reach 80mn tonnes by 2016, making it the worlds largest polyolefins market. China is now the worlds largest PP consumer, with BMI projecting that demand will reach 11mn tonnes in 2010, one-third more than in 2006. This is likely to lead to a deficit of over 1mn tonnes. Most new capacity will come onstream in 2009-2012, causing a temporary decline in capacity utilisation to no less than 85%. In 2008 alone BMI estimates the amount of added capacity at over 4mn tpa, with a further 5mn tpa in 2009-2010. According to BMI forecasts, China will contribute 24% of the 14mn tpa of PP capacity that is due to come online worldwide between 2008 and 2013. The whole of Asia will represent just under half the additional capacity, while the Middle East will add a further 25%, largely due to the developments in Saudi Arabia. China is to become the worlds biggest PP producing country. Capacity expansion is occurring during a period of economic downturn, leading to excess capacity. We expect PP producers in the Middle East and Asia to firm up their positions on the global market, exporting their surpluses to the detriment of Western European and North American producers, which are unlikely to bring significant new capacity online over the coming years. BMI analysis indicates that profitability in Western Europe and North America will come under attack from cheap imports and these regions will struggle to maintain their competitiveness on export markets. BMI forecasts a net decline in PP capacity in these areas, with producers mothballing or closing older, smaller and less efficient plants of capacities under 200,000tpa and focusing their attention on increasing capacity at larger sites. Production is shifting east, following the pattern of demand. BMI expects modest declines in US capacity over the next five years. US producers are set to devote an increasing proportion of output to the domestic market as exports come under pressure from new capacity in the Middle East and Asia. Net US exports are likely to fall to zero by 2012. The main challenge for the US is over-reliance on propylene derived from fluid catalytic cracker units in refineries. As refinery capacity is unlikely to keep up with the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 growing demand for propylene feedstock, PP producers are expected to be forced to look to other sources to sustain output. BMI forecasts that US demand will reach around 9mn tpa in 2009, an 18% rise over 2005 levels, leaving a net surplus of around 1mn tpa for export. In Western Europe BMI estimates show that the recovery in PP demand slowed considerably from 2005 to 2008 as the regions economy slowed. Demand growth is set to be stronger in Central and Eastern European markets over the next five years, although outside Russia no significant extra PP capacity is set to come online. This trend could lead to the EU becoming a net PP importer over the next five years. Producers are already closing PP plants and are focusing attention on removing bottlenecks and expanding their other facilities. The stagnation in production in Europe and North America and slower demand growth rates are in stark contrast to the surging Chinese market, which we predict to be increasingly self-sufficient. China is the worlds largest PP consumer, and BMI projects that demand will reach 11mn tonnes in 2010, one-third more than in 2006. This is likely to lead to a deficit of over 1mn tonnes. However, the addition of 4mn tpa of PP capacity in 2008-2011, with other projects in the pipeline, should help contain growth in imports. BMI forecasts that China will represent 23% of the 14mn tpa of PP capacity due to come online worldwide between 2008 and 2012. The whole of Asia will represent just under half the additional capacity, while the Middle East will add a further 23%, largely due to developments in Saudi Arabia. There are no plans for additional capacity in the US, giving China the opportunity to become the worlds biggest PP producing country. Most of the contribution to capacity expansion in the Americas will be in Brazil, with 2mn tpa due to be added over the next five years. PP projects have faced delays in the Middle East. The opening of PetroRabighs 700,000tpa PP plant in Saudi Arabia was moved from Q408 to Q109, while the Sharq and Yansab complexes, which have a large amount of associated PP capacity, were also moved to 2009. Other PP plants due to come online in the country in 2009 included a 250,000tpa expansion of Saudi Polyolefins plant at Al-Jubail. Also at Al-Jubail, the Al-Waha Petrochemical JV between LyondellBasell and Sahara Olefins is due to add an extra 460,000tpa of PP. PP producers face significant risks. A stronger than expected slowdown in Chinese growth could lead to a glut in supply, driving prices down and forcing less competitive operations out of business. Margins would also be put under pressure by sustained high oil prices, which would keep the price of propylene at high levels. A combination of over-capacity and rising costs of raw materials could lead to the reduction of PP capacity in developed markets. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 A significant constraint facing the industry is the tightening of the propylene market as production of the monomer outstrips refinery output. Cuts in refinery throughput during the course of the global economic downturn will make this constraint more evident. As a result, some PP producers are considering plans to build plants dedicated to propylene production. While feedstock prices are set to rise, Chinese and Middle Eastern producers are managing to bring down prices of end products, leading to pressures on margins, particularly for producers in the developed world. The only way producers from the regions will be able stay afloat is to corner niche markets with innovative products, requiring greater technical sophistication than currently offered by plants in emerging markets. Efficiency in the manufacturing process also needs to be improved and markets developed. At the same time, energy and transportation prices are high, although will ease with the decline in oil prices. Chilling Out Nothing short of a weather miracle can empty brimming storage tanks and take some of the pressure off the beleaguered refining industry. Another prolonged period of snow and arctic temperatures is needed in January and February in order to ensure that the inventory position improves sufficiently. There is some scope for this, but there are likely to be continuing stock surpluses and narrow refining margins in 2010. Demand growth, particularly for jet and diesel, needs to be strong and sustained if the products markets are to have a good year. Otherwise, rising crude costs and weak product demand implies more misery for refinery operators. The December 2009 cold snap, combined with increasing seasonal demand and stock draws helped underpin product market sentiment at the end of 2009, boosting crack spreads and refining margins in the US and Europe. The winter of 2008/09 was unusually cold, and the current season needs to be colder still if the stock draw is to accelerate and margin strength be retained. Huge distillate volumes are still being stored offshore, while gasoline stocks have been on the rise. It could be that positive sentiment evaporates as soon as the last snow melts. After Decembers heavy snow in the north east US, distillate inventories started to fall, down by 10mn bbl in the month. This boosted heating oil prices before the US distillate market lost some of its short-lived strength in the second week of January as the de-stocking trend reversed on the back of lower-than-expected demand growth and forecasts for normal weather temperature in the short term in the main heating-fuel markets. Improving gasoline demand, along with a slowing of stock builds in December, supported gasoline prices. In early January gasoline stock builds once again accelerated, in part reflecting the difficult US driving Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Global Oil Products Price Outlook Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 conditions and consequent demand weakness. Any continuation of this situation will undermine gasoline market sentiment and encourage traders to liquidate long positions, putting downwards pressure on prices. European product market sentiment strengthened appreciably as the winter weather hit and arbitrage opportunities opened up for gasoline to the US and West Africa. The gasoline spread against Brent crude in Rotterdam rose to above US$7 per barrel in early January from about US$6/bbl in the first week of December. Unfortunately, recent bullish developments in the European gasoline market may be countered by increased gasoline stock builds in the US. The European naphtha market may remain strong over the next months amid useful and persistent arbitrage opportunities to Asia and improving economic growth prospects. Even the European distillates market has been gaining momentum on the back of the regions icy temperatures and fewer import cargoes. These developments led to stock draws and a narrowing of the contango in the gasoil market. This could result in some reduction of the ample offshore distillate stocks, standing in excess of 100mn bbl. Given the persistent overhang in distillate stocks in Europe, still well above the five-year average, prices are not expected to improve appreciably over the near term. The Energy Information Administration estimates that OECD commercial oil inventories were 2bn bbl at the end of 2009, or about 58 days of forward cover, and about 80mn bbl more than the five-year average for that time of year. It predicts OECD oil inventories will remain at the upper end of the historical range in 2010. Revised Forecasts BMI estimates that the global wholesale price for premium unleaded gasoline was US$81/bbl in Q409. This compares with US$77in Q309. Over the year the price ranged from a monthly low of US$49in January 2009 to US$83/bbl in November. Gasoline prices in Q409 were up from US$56in Q408. For Q110 we forecast an average global gasoline price of US$87/bbl, up 8% quarter-on-quarter and 68% year-on-year , from US$52/bbl in Q109. For 2010 as a whole, BMI puts gasoline at an average US$96/bbl, with the price expecting to peak in July at more than US$116/bbl. Gasoline prices will rise 38% y-o-y in 2010. In Q409 gasoil averaged US$81/bbl, based on a composite global price. This was a y-o-y rise of almost 8%. Our revised forecast for Q110 is for global gasoil to average US$91, up 12% q-o-q. The weather will have helped gasoil prices relative to gasoline, in spite of the unusually large inventory position. For 2010 as a whole, we forecast an average price of US$94/bbl, probably peaking in January 2010 if cold weather persists. The full-year outturn will be a 36% increase y-o-y. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Jet prices averaged US$83/bbl in Q409, using the composite for New York, Singapore and Rotterdam. The y-o-y increase was just under 6%, with jet lagging behind the gain in gasoil prices. The monthly low in 2009 was US$53in February 2009, with the price reaching US$84/bbl in November 2009. In Q110 we assume an average global jet price of US$96, up 15% q-o-q and 69% y-o-y. For 2010 as a whole we forecast US$97/bbl, up from US$70/bbl in 2009. In 2009 naphtha was a surprisingly robust performer among the major refined products, gaining 92% between January and November. In Q409 naphtha averaged US$73, up from US$66/bbl in Q3 and US$54in Q2. We put the 2010 average naphtha price at US$80/bbl, up 35% y-o-y. Looking further ahead, we see gasoline prices rising to US$99/bbl in 2011 and stabilising around US$105/bbl from 2012. Gasoil is expected to climb to US$96in 2011, reaching a plateau of US$102/bbl from 2012. The price of jet is forecast to average US$100/bbl in 2011, before levelling out at US$106/bbl from 2012.

Table: Oil Product Price Forecasts Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Petrochemical producers in the EU are coming under regulatory pressure, which they claim is putting them at a disadvantage to their Middle Eastern, Asian, and Russian rivals. However, BMI research finds that many of these claims are exaggerated and are unlikely to pose a significant problem to the competitiveness of European petrochemicals majors. In June 2007, the EUs REACH directive came into force, despite concerns from industry bodies about its implementation and possible adverse effects on competitiveness. REACH is the EUs new framework for registering and assessing chemicals, and directly affects manufacturers, importers and users of chemicals across a wide range of sectors. It rationalises the EU regulatory system for chemicals, replacing over 40 pieces of legislation. The aim of the programme is to identify and phase out the most hazardous chemicals, insisting on their substitution with safer alternatives wherever possible. This is as opposed to the old system, which was based on establishing safe levels of chemical exposure. Each of the substances covered by REACH but not products themselves need to be registered with the new European Chemicals Agency based in Helsinki. The onus is on the producer to ensure that any imported substances are registered with the ECA in order to sell them on the European market. REACH is being phased in by initially targeting the most hazardous substances. Registration is required for all substances supplied above 1tpa, which covers over 30,000 substances. REACH is intended to: Increase knowledge of the hazards of chemicals; Only allow chemicals onto the market if specific safety data on them is made available; Detect, limit and, when needed, replace hazardous substances with safer alternatives; Shift the burden of providing proof that chemicals are not dangerous from the public authorities to chemical manufacturers; Ensure that there is adequate information on all chemicals, and that this information is communicated to all who come into contact with the chemicals from users to final consumers . Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 European Overview Regulation Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 While REACH may help to protect the EU from hazardous imports, petrochemicals producers based in the EU claim they are being put at a disadvantage in the fastest growing markets in Asia notably China at a time when producers in the Middle East, Russia and other emerging markets are ramping up capacity with far lighter regulatory structures. The Middle East is expected to overtake Europe by 2015, when it will account for about 20% of world ethylene capacity, against Europes 17%. At the same time, Chinas importance is increasing, with demand expected to keep rising by at least 9% per annum between 2007 and 2012 compared with around 2% for the US and the EU. However, the Chinese are also aiming to boost their capacity, making China a highly competitive market. As the Chinese increase their domestic capacity, Middle Eastern producers are likely to turn to Europe to dispose of future surplus capacity. Russia is also expected to start investing heavily in petrochemicals in the next few years. Table: Key Elements Of REACH Registration A manufacturer or importer is required to register any substance that they supply to the EU market in amounts of over 1tpa. Evaluation The authorities carry out annual in-depth assessments of substances flagged as being of potential high risk . Authorisation The uses of substances of very high concern, e.g. CMRs (carcinogens, mutagens and toxic to reproduction), PBTs and vPvBs (very persistent, very bioaccumulative) require authorisation. Agency A new EU Chemicals Agency based in Helsinki administers REACH, in co-operation with member states competent authorities. Source: DEFRA Supporters of REACH in the environmental lobby insist that the long-term direct costs are negligible compared with sales turnover and can be absorbed by the petrochemicals and chemicals industries. They point to a European Commission Extended Impact Assessment carried out in 2003, which estimated that the direct costs of REACH to the European chemicals industry would amount to a total EUR2bn over a period of 11 years representing 0% of the chemical industrys annual sales. While BMI agrees that large petrochemicals companies will be able to foot the bill for REACH, small and medium-sized enterprises will face significant adversity. In a report released before REACH was adopted in December 2006, the German industry group, Verband der Chemischen Industrie , said that the regulation imposes a considerable burden on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. They stated this was owing to the problems such businesses can face if suppliers no longer produce a substance that they require in the manufacturing process. It added: Small and medium-sized enterprises do not usually have the leverage to convince a supplier to register a product and document the specific use to which it is put. In many cases the only option remaining to a downstream user is to go through the protracted process of changing its Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 formulation. The reformulation of large parts of their product portfolio is therefore a crucial cost factor for downstream users. However, there are few SMEs in the petrochemicals sector that would be directly affected by REACH. Economies of scale in the petrochemicals industry require large-scale production, effectively preventing the emergence of a significant number of SME producers in the sector. Moreover, REACH includes special provisions to help SME low-tonnage suppliers. These include greatly reduced information requirements for substances supplied between one and ten tonnes, and an 11-year registration period for these substances. SMEs also benefit from reduced fees. REACH also provides some benefits for SMEs, with most risk assessment for chemical substances undertaken by larger producers, which are required to share the data a requirement that has been resisted by majors. Consequently, the impact of REACH across the petrochemical sector will be inconsequential to the competitiveness of European companies. EU chemicals output, excludingpharmaceuticals, fell by 22% y-o-y inJanuary 2009, according to the EuropeanChemical Industry Council . Cefichave also reported that businessconfidence among chemical industrymanagers continued to deteriorate inMarch 2009. However, price data showedthat chemical products remained stable inJanuary 2009, suggesting that output cutshad stabilised the market. Base chemicalsregistered the biggest drop in output inJanuary, while specialty chemicals andconsumer chemicals recorded a less significant decline. For 2008 as a whole, the EU chemicals industry experienced a 4% decline in output. Ethylene production in Western Europe was down 8% to 19mn tonnes. Petrochemical prices grew 7%, with polymers and specialty chemicals experiencing price changes of 2% and 3% respectively. Output was well below forecasts of 2% growth made at the beginning of 2008. The 4% decline represented the first year of negative growth since 2003, and according to Cefic was related to the dramatic slowdown in EU economic activity and the sharp deceleration of world output and trade. This was exacerbated by the financial crisis in H208, which resulted in a stronger downturn in the construction and automotive sectors two of the top consumers of petrochemicals. Meanwhile, output in the US fell by 2%.

Leading producers such as BASF, Bayer MaterialScience, Lanxess, Merck KGaA, Arkema, DSM and Rhodia carried out temporary closures of plants in Europe and other regions in H109. Some European producers such as Arkema, DSM, and Rhodia have announced production cutbacks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 25 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 In Ukraine, the chemicals and petrochemicals industry has traditionally been considered fundamental to the economy, owing to the role it plays in manufacturing intermediates. The government has begun to gradually implement financial reforms and privatisation legislation, allowing foreign participation in the industry. A strategic plan for the chemicals industry up to 2010 has been developed. This includes: expanding the output and range of fertiliser and plant protection agents; improving non-toxic packaging materials for the food-processing industry; expanding the range of chemicals for light industry; and developing new chemical materials for the high-technology industries. However, much of the planning may have been seriously damaged by the recent decline in output and pressures on the industry. Eastern European companies have increased their sales activity in Ukraine in recent years. Czech-based Chemopetrol increased its sales volume by a factor of 20, while the Hungarian Tiszai Vegyi Kombint increased sales 100-fold. Over the same period, sales volumes of Russian producers declined in Ukraine. The chemicals industry in Ukraine comprises chemicals, petrochemicals and chemical-pharmaceutical sub-segments, with more than 1,600 enterprises and structural units. The chemicals sub-segment accounts for nearly 17% of the production, while the petrochemicals and chemical-pharmaceutical sub-segments account for the remainder. The petrochemicals industry manufactures a variety of products, including car and motorcycle tyres , hoses and consumer goods. Petrochemicals and rubber-asbestos enterprises are concentrated in the regions of Donbas, Prydniprovia, Prysivashia and Prykarpattya. The major centres include Kyiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Shostka, Sumy and Rubizhne. Considerable structural changes are underway in the chemicals and petrochemicals industry. State-owned enterprises constitute less than one-fifth of the total number of petrochemicals facilities, and account for about one-third of the products. KarpatNaftoKhim operates a petrochemicals plant including a 250,000tpa ethylene cracker at Kalush. The nations other cracker is situated at the Linos oil refinery, and has a production capacity of 300,000tpa. The countrys only PP plant is operated by TNK-BP. From January 1 2006, TNK-BP has been refining its oil in Ukraine at the Lisichansk oil refinery, which is owned and managed by CJSC LINIK. Oriana, at Kalush in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, is Ukraines largest petrochemicals enterprise. It has 10 independent plants and a number of auxiliary workshops and services, and produces more than 100 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 26 Ukraine Market Overview Market Structure Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 commodities, including olefins, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda and antistatic. It also operates a potassium fertiliser plant, as well as ethylene, propylene and benzene units.

Ukraine is in last place in BMIs CEE Petrochemicals Business Environment matrix this quarter, with 38points. Ukraines uncertain political environment, coupled with rising gas import prices and the possibility of supply disruption, are undermining the countrys potential for increased petrochemicals production capacity. The situation has deteriorated since last quarter, with a sharp downturn in the domestic economy, coupled with tightening credit conditions and a decline in key markets. The sector is dominated by Russian petrochemicals majors and remains tied into the old Soviet economic framework as a satellite of Russia. Diversification of feedstock and markets could ensure stable growth in the long term.

Ukraine scores just 33points, owing to a reassessment of polymer production capacities. Ukraine has the lowest polymer capacity in the region, with just one PP plant with a capacity of 200,000tpa and a polyvinyl chloride facility with a nameplate capacity of 55,000tpa. The country has an ethylene production capacity of 550,000tpa, putting it slightly ahead of Romania. The score will improve with the development of new PVC production facilities, and if the Azot PE plant, with a capacity of 150,000tpa, is brought back into operation. The country structure rating comprises BMIs scores for financial and physical infrastructure and trade bureaucracy. Ukraine scores a poor 44points, which is well behind the regional average of 59points. Ukraine has passed a number of legislative reforms that will underpin the development of the legal infrastructure necessary to support foreign investment but reform is ongoing. The government has embarked on market liberalisation, cutting back on regulation and removing many licensing requirements. Most restrictions on foreign exchange transactions have also been removed. Foreign businesses dealing with the country cite confusing, ill-defined regulations as a major hindrance to trade. The changed political environment, and a willingness to open up the countrys borders enough to permit entry to the WTO and acquire better trading terms with major blocs, may now start to yield more rapid results. Risks To Realisation Of Returns This rating comprises the ratings for market and country risks, weighted towards market risks. The market risk rating measures the regulatory environment of the petrochemicals sector. Ukraine scores 40points, with its score having been under pressure in recent months owing to the sectors vulnerability to supply cuts from Russia. This was demonstrated in January 2009, when Gazprom cut gas supplies to Ukraine. Members of Ukraines main government security agency service, the Sluzhba Bezpeky Ukrayiny , raided the headquarters of Ukrainian state-run gas company Naftogaz on March 4. This was in an apparent attempt to acquire a copy of the original contract signed on January 19, between Naftogaz and Gazprom which ended the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. The raid appears to be the latest event in an increasingly bitter power struggle between Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko over the countrys energy industry. The dispute could have serious implications for the near-term flow of Russian gas to and through Ukraine. Despite Ukraines large domestic market and strong economic potential, most foreign investors have to date been deterred by the poor business environment. President Viktor Yushchenkos victory in 2004 had obvious positive implications for improvements in the business environment. Reforms have been centred on WTO accession, which was approved in February 2008, with Business Monitor International Ltd Page 29 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 membership officially attained in May. On the upside, the petrochemicals sector is not encumbered by the environmental regulations imposed on neighbouring countries that have joined the EU. The Ukrainian petrochemicals sector is oriented to serving the Ukrainian and Russian economies, which means that it is largely unaffected by REACH. Nevertheless, Ukrainian production units are dependent on Russian suppliers and investors, making them vulnerable to Russias interests, which are often oriented towards its political objectives. The country risk rating covers the long-term economic, financial and political risks and the structure of the economy. Ukraine scores just 40points, owing to deterioration in the long-term financial and external risk scores, with foreign investors wary of the elevated international risk scenario. The overall business environment can be considered unattractive, largely owing to: a high level of perceived political risk; only moderate progress in deregulation and competition; and limited growth potential in oil and gas production. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Industry Trends And Developments The petrochemicals sector in Ukraine could face collapse, owing to plummeting output and a sharp decline in domestic demand and export. The economic outlook for the country as a whole is dire. Output decline hasfollowed the trend of theeconomic cycle. In 2008,the chemical andpetrochemical indexsuggested that the volume of production fell by 3% over the year. The decline was more marked in H208, with BMI estimating the output in this sector to have declined by nearly 40%. However, Ukraines largest petrochemicals producer, KarpatNaftoKhim, had announced as early as February 2008 that it was considering suspending operations owing to a drop in demand for ethylene in Europe; and it reportedly paused operations at its major facilities in July. All petrochemicals segments were affected by the sharp downturn, with producers idling capacity in sectors such as PVC by the end of the year and delaying construction plans. Then, in January 2009, chemicals and petrochemicals production shrank by close to 50%, as the sector effectively ground to a halt during the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute .This was in contrast to 2006 and 2007, when chemicals and petrochemicals industrial growth was 3% and 6% respectively, and contrary to projections from within the sector. At the same time, the fertiliser sector has suffered owing to earlier gas supply cuts from Russia. In October 2009, the Ukrainian government cancelled a winning UAH5bn bid for the Odessa Port Plant . The government, which set a minimum price of UAH4bn , claimed that bidders had plotted to bring the purchase price down. Ukraines Nortima was the declared winner of the auction before the government invalidated the bid. The company beat Ukraines Frunze-Flora and Russian Sibur subsidiary Azot Seris. OPP owns and operates two ammonia and two urea plants at Odessas Yuzhnyi Port, with combined capacity for 1mn tpa and 900,000tpa . It also owns an export terminal for ammonia and urea that ships products made by other plants in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian Petrochemical And Chemical Production Indices, 2000-2008 Index, percent oftheprevious year Industry Chemical and Petrochemical Source: Ukraine State Statistics Committee Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 In July 2009, TNK-BP announced it had increased its effective stake in its main Ukrainian asset, the Lysychansk oil refinery, to almost 100%. The firm is intent on modernising and expanding Ukrainian refining capacities, with a view selling high-quality car fuel. In March 2008, KarpatNaftoKhim, part of Lukoil Groups chemicals division, Lukoil-Neftekhim, began construction of a new PVC plant in Kalush. Run by Lukoils Ukrainian subsidiary, Zao Lukor, KarpatNaftoKhim is investing around US$210mn to establish Ukraines first PVC production facility which will have a planned capacity of 300,000tpa. Uhde has been appointed as the contractor for the plant. The new unit was expected to be completed and operating some time during 2009. However, the slump in the PVC market casts doubt on the viability of the operation, meaning it could be delayed until 2010. The KarpatNaftoKhim plant would produce plastic for windows and aluminium window profiles, which Ukraine currently does not produce. The investment is in addition to the US$600mn that Lukoil-Neftekhim is investing in the construction of a chlor-alkali plant, also at Kalush. KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of the new plant in June 2007. The new facility will have capacity to produce about 206,000tpa of caustic soda and 181,000tpa of chlorine, and was originally expected to come online in Q208. However, the plants opening has been repeatedly postponed, with KarpatNaftoKhim announcing a further delay in March 2009. The plant is now scheduled to come onstream in Q309. KarpatNaftoKhim discontinued operations at its old chlorine and caustic soda facility in August 2006, largely owing to the impact of high raw-material and energy costs. Together, the two projects in Kalush will establish a major industrial petrochemicals and plastics facility sufficient to supply the construction sector. Currently, raw materials from KarpatNaftoKhim are exported to other countries in the region, where they are processed and re-imported as finished products. In April 2007, TNK-BP outlined plans to invest around US$400mn in its operational and marketing assets development in Ukraine during 2007-2010. It has suggested the scale of investment will depend on the countrys investment climate. Company executives have complained that the government has dragged out negotiations over refining investment, with little progress since mid-2006. The main reason for the delays is the deteriorating political situation, which is undermining the business environment. Additionally, TNK-BP claims that the government owes it US$64mn in Value Added Tax refunds and is dragging its feet on repayment, owing to political issues concerning the governments financial programme. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute dominated the last quarter, with the row having devastating effects on the already troubled petrochemicals sector in Ukraine. Chemicals and petrochemicals production shrank by close to 50% in January 2009, as the sector effectively ground to a halt during the dispute. Continuing tensions further threaten future output levels and prospects for the sector. In early January 2009, the Kremlin cut off gas supplies running through Ukraines pipelines, which delivers around 80% of Russias gas exports to Europe leaving many European customers without gas for nearly two weeks. Russia initially cut supplies to Ukraine on January 1 after the two countries failed to agree on a 2009 supply deal. Six days later, gas exports to Europe flowing through Ukraine were stopped after Russia accused Kiev of stealing gas. Exports were resumed on January 20 with the signing of a 10-year supply and transit contract. The transit deal should see the Russian gas monopoly, Gazprom, export 120bcm of gas to Europe via Ukraine in 2009. Ukraine was set to import 40bcm, according to the supply deal, although Kiev said it only needs 33bcm from Russia to partially meet its 2009 needs of 56bcm. Ukrainian gas will contribute 20bcm. There is a possibility that Ukraine so badly hit by the economic crisis will be unable to meet Russian payment demands. In March 2009, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promised Russia would not push Ukraine over the edge with high gas bills, saying that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. However, Putin had earlier threatened that Russia would cut off supplies if bills went unpaid. Tensions over gas payments have also revived feuding between Ukrainian President Yuschenko and Prime Minister Tymoshenko. According to the state gas company, Naftogaz, Ukraine imported 49bcm for domestic usein 2008. In late March 2009, Russia broke off talks with Ukraine on a US$5bn loan to shore up its economy, after Kiev asked the EU to help modernise its pipeline network with a view to increasing capacity. This was a move that was welcomed by the EU. Russia was angered at not being included in discussions, although Kiev maintained that there had been talks with Moscow. Russia has said that it wants to be involved in any modernisation, thus helping to secure gas supply to Europe, but some analysts suggest that Russia is trying to gain control of the strategic pipelines. Russian officials warned of further gas supply disruptions if the countrys interests were ignored. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine over unpaid gas supplies had earlier threatened to undermine supply of feedstock to the countrys fertiliser industry. In March 2008, Gazprom cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine by 25%, and threatened to cut a further 25% if Ukraine did not settle a US$600mn gas bill and Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Upstream Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 sign contracts for the supply of gas in 2008. In response, Ukraine has accused Gazprom of failing to pay any gas transit fees since December 2007, a charge disputed by the Russians, who contest that no bill has been sent by Ukraine. Naftogaz paid its debts to Gazprom in full on March 5 2009, averting fears of a repeat of the January disruptions to European gas supply. Following a warning from Russian Prime Minister Putin that gas deliveries to Ukrainian and European consumers would be halted unless Naftogazs debt for February gas deliveries was paid in full by March 7, the Ukrainian company sent Russia the final instalment of the US$360mn bill. Gazprom confirmed shortly afterwards that the payment had been received. In light of the pressure on Ukraine to develop its own gas reserves, Chornomornaftogaz a wholly owned subsidiary of Naftogaz with responsibility for developing the offshore fields in the Black and Azov Seas signed a memorandum of understanding with China National Offshore Oil Corp in February 2009. The agreement was to bring China into a project to build a pipeline to the Odessa gas deposits. The Ukrainian government is yet to approve the MoU, however. In addition, Chornomornaftogaz reports that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering investing in the Black Sea fields. In November 2008, Naftogaz requested a US$476mn investment by the state to develop the Odessa, Bezymyanny and Subbotin fields. The draft state budget in September 2008 had reportedly allocated around US$80mn to the project, although it is unclear if that amount has been reallocated in light of Ukraines economic troubles. Ukraine has six oil refineries, most of which are Russian-owned, with a combined capacity of 51mn tpa. In recent years, the load rate of refineries has declined, with the deterioration of the infrastructure and the temporary halting of the work of the Odessa and Kherson refineries leading to a 30% efficiency rate. Ukrainian refineries fail to meet Euro-5 standards. The Lysychansk refinery is able to produce oil to Euro-4 standards and the Odessa refinery complies with Euro-3. All other refineries are unable to even meet Euro-2 compliance. However, the Oil and Gas Journal reported in March 2009 that Paris-based Axens has been awarded a contract to upgrade the gasoline pool at the Kremenchug refinery, which will enable the production of Euro-5 grade gasoline by 2011. The 360,000b/d refinery has the largest throughput capacity in Ukraine, and the upgrade is the first of its kind in the country. In addition, TNKBP said that it had completed upgrades on its Lysychansk refinery, which would see the plant through to 2010, and was considering investing some US$41mn in 2009 to modernise its Linos refinery. The company also announced its intentions to maintain production levels of oil products in 2009, despite falling consumption. TNK-BP, which refined 10mn tonnes of gas and oil condensates in 2008, hopes to pick up the slack from declining imports. The volume of oil refining of Ukrainian refineries meets only 80% of demand, and the country is heavily dependent on imported oil, even with a major decline in demand since independence. Despite some Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 efforts at exploration, oil production has remained relatively stable since 1991, with the Oil and Gas Journal putting the countrys proven reserves at 395mn bbl in 2007. Poor capacity utilisation has an impact further downstream, raising prices and causing a squeeze on naphtha supply for feedstock for the petrochemicals sector. However, small-scale progress has been reported at the Lelyaki oil field, which is being developed by the Kashtan Petroleum joint venture . Output is now 400bbl/d, and further wells are to be drilled in 2009. In June 2008, details emerged of a plan to build a new oil refinery in Ukraine to process Caspian oil, although the current status of the project is unclear. The refinery would be a joint project involving Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and the EBRD. The refinery would cost US$4bn to build over a three- to five-year period. Possible sites include the Odessa or Lviv regions. The refinery would help overcome Ukraines infrastructural problems in the refining sector and will meet Euro-5 standards, enabling it to supply the EU market. Production at the refinery is expected to reach 10mn tpa of oil. In Q108, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine accused TNK-BP of being a monopolist, claiming that there was a correlation between the Lisichansk and Kremenchug refineries that suggested inflated price-fixing. TNK-BP has strongly denied the accusations. In a statement released in March, the company pointed out that imports account for 40-60% of the fuel market with the share of domestic refiners not exceeding 50%. It claimed that the Lisichansk refinery was loss-making and was only able to defend its existing market share, and had no plans to expand and push back the market share of foreign producers. Concluding, the company said that prices were determined by market forces and competition with imports and that it was therefore unable to determine fuel prices on the Ukrainian market. If the Antimonopoly Committee takes action, it could seek to split up the companys activities in the refining, wholesale and retail areas. This would disrupt the vertical integration of the petrochemicals company. Ukraine formally acceded to the WTO in May 2008, having secured approval of its membership bid in February that year. For Ukraines petrochemicals producers, WTO membership is a major positive step, easing access to both raw materials and promising better access to Western markets in the future. After the political chaos of the last few years, accession ensures for big business at least that the newly installed government under Prime Minister Tymoshenko is capable of delivering on trade and economic policy. Membership effectively ends Ukraines trade agreement with Russia, which enables Russian petrochemicals to be exported to Ukraine free of duty. Under WTO rules, Ukraine will be unable to grant preferential import tariffs. Russian petrochemicals products will be subject to a 10% tariff. This will be of benefit to Ukrainian producers of raw materials, but will push up the cost of feedstock for plants operating further downstream, which often rely on raw-materials imports from Russia. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 WTO Accession Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 The contraction in Ukraines petrochemicals industry in 2009 came in the context of a 15% fall in real GDP. Though the recession is broad-based, with trade, consumption and investment indicators all continuing to decline in y-o-y terms, the ongoing collapse in gross fixed capital formation and household consumption were particularly pronounced. This impacted negatively on the key petrochemicals consuming industries, such as construction, consumer goods manufacturing and the automotive industry. Construction was the hardest hit sector, falling by around a half. Even the fertiliser segment, which is traditionally more stable than other major petrochemical consumers such as the automotive and construction industries reported a massive decline in production volumes, despite modest growth in agriculture. Meanwhile, vehicle production fell a 83% y-o-y to 56,135 vehicles in the first three quarters of 2009, according to the Ukrainian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association . This led to a drastic decline in demand for engineering PP. In the period of January-November 2009, production of plastic in primary forms totalled 279,500 tonnes, down by 32% y-o-y. Monthly output reached a peak of 30,300 tonnes in October , while November production was 27,700 tonnes . Although growth was largely the result of a low comparison base, it was favourable compared to overall industrial performance, which saw 6% y-oy decline in October. This indicated that the petrochemicals sector was entering into an earlier stage than the rest of Ukraines industrial sector, albeit due primarily to the restocking which had to occur following inventory depletion. Overall chemical and petrochemical production was down 23% y-o-y in 2009, with chemicals output down 22% and output rubber and plastic products down 24%. While the Ukrainian petrochemicals industry is not expected to contract any further, due to the depth of the decline, it will take until at least 2012 before it reaches 2008 levels. BMI forecasts plastics output of 365,000 tonnes in 2010, up by around 17% over 2009 levels. Although growth will be strong, it is largely due to base effects. Output will still be 16% down on 2008 levels, and the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector will be operating at around 70% capacity which is well below the 80-85% level which BMI regards to be the break-even point for the industry. The economy will begin a modest recovery in 2010, with GDP real growth at just 1%, with higher rates of growth in subsequent years. The petrochemicals industry should receive a boost in the 2010-12 period as a result of the construction and other activity related to the countrys joint hosting of the UEFA football championships. A diversification in markets and feedstock sourcing to remove the industrys dependence on domestic and Russian demand would enhance Ukraines petrochemical prospects. However, the outlook for petrochemicals exports is bleak with the Russian, Turkish and EU markets also set to see sharp declines in demand. With the kind of economic growth rates seen in 2000-2007 unlikely to be repeated, the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Industry Forecast Scenario Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 petrochemicals industry will be more heavily reliant on export markets. The depreciation of the hryvnia may provide some slight relief in terms of competitiveness, but equally it raises the cost of feedstock; which has to be passed on to the consumer or simply absorbed by the industry which is already financially precarious. If the demand does not exist, then depreciation is unlikely to make a significant difference. Russian economic growth is not likely to be remarkable over the forecast period, and the market is at risk of going into over-capacity owing to additional planned capacity being due to come online. Consequently, Ukrainian producers will be more reliant on the eurozone for sales. Added to that is the strongly pro-cyclical trend evident in the petrochemicals sector, with peaks being higher than average industrial output and troughs a lot lower. As industrial output plunges, petrochemicals production will fall at a faster rate. As a result, new capacity plans such as the PVC plant in Kalush are likely to be halted or abandoned altogether, as credit availability dries up and demand collapses both at home and among Ukraines main trading partners. Lukoil-Neftekhim began construction of a US$250mn PVC plant at Kalush in Q108, the output of which will include 300,000tpa of PVC, in addition to US$600mn of chlorine. There will also be a sodium hydroxide plant on site. BMI doubts that construction will be completed until 2010 or later, owing to the depth and length of Ukraines economic recession. In the long term, the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector will depend on a continuous and reliable source of feedstock. According to a study by the Ukrainian National Academy of Science, Ukraines natural gas consumption could double by 2030, while the countrys natural gas production may only increase by 33% over that period. Supplies from Russia have been subjected to severe political disputes between the two countries that may not have been conclusively resolved. Naftogaz Ukrainy is considering other sources of natural gas, including Iran and Norway. With construction of a gas pipeline from Iran to Armenia under development, Ukraine believes that an Iran-Armenia-Georgia-Crimea pipeline is possible, linking the pipeline from Georgia across the Black Sea to Ukraines Crimean port of Feodosia. Iran is looking to increase its natural gas imports to Europe, and Ukraine is interested in maintaining its position as the major transit point for natural gas to Europe. However, the distance and substantial projected cost of such a pipeline has so far inhibited the implementation of this plan. The threat to gas supplies from Russia is a significant downside risk to Ukrainian petrochemicals as it denies the industry access to ethane feedstock. The government has, in the past, found it difficult to find the money to finance its debt to Russias Gazprom. We caution that given the firm's financial difficulties, there could be a potential disruption to gas supplies in 2010 when Ukraine begins to pay full market price for its imports. In terms of naphtha feedstock potential, there is no immediate need for an increase in nameplate oil refining capacity, as it is already surplus to domestic requirements at 1mn b/d. This makes it unlikely Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 that Ukraine will secure more domestic naphtha supply in the near future. However, in the long-term, there is scope for investment in new refineries and modernisation of existing refineries, which are experiencing low levels of capacity utilisation. Polish petrochemical and refining company, PKN Orlen, indicated in 2008 that it may consider investing in a new refinery to be built near Brody. In May 2009, Ukraine and Libya reached initial agreements to construct a new 200,000b/d oil refinery in the Odessa region. Libya has also preliminarily agreed to provide 4mn bbl to the existing Kremenchug refinery, which has suffered supply disruptions following the souring of Kiev's relationship with Moscow. Any level of uncertainty concerning feedstock will have negative consequences for the petrochemicals sector, with a shortage of feedstock for its cracker units. BMI believes that gas price hikes will lead to a downturn in ethylene output, with exports projected to decline to zero over the forecast period. Ethylene output could be in the range of 200,000-250,000tpa over the next five years. Cuts in ethylene output will increase dependency on PE imports, considering that the domestic industry is without a ready availability of feedstock. Ukraine is also set to become more dependent on PP imports. An improvement in the business environment and greater certainty over gas imports and prices would alleviate some of the problems facing the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. At present, the deteriorating domestic political environment makes it unlikely that Ukraine will see an expansion in production capacity over the next two to three years.

Source: World Cracker Report, CMAI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 39 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 UEFA 2012 Key to Medium-Term Growth Outlook We maintain our view that Ukraine's economy continued to contract in H209, albeit at a slower pace than that recorded in H109. We project real GDP expanding by an average 3%. However, we caution that if UEFA decides to strip one of the host cities in Ukraine of its right to host the 2012 football championship, we would necessitate a downward revision to this forecast. A recent data release from the State Statistics Committee designed to approximate GDP output shows Ukraine's economy contracting by 18% y-o-y in real terms in Q209, slightly better than the 20% fall recorded in the first quarter of the year . Although a full breakdown of GDP into its expenditure components is unavailable, we expect the same factors that drove the economy's decline in Q1 to have remained firmly in play through the second quarter of the year. We note that Ukraine's recession is broad based, with investment, consumption and trade indicators all showing precipitous declines in y-o-y terms. While we are encouraged that the ongoing recession appears to have now troughed, we maintain our view that the economy is likely to continue contracting through at least the third and fourth quarters of the year. Although Ukraine's export sector looks set to rebound in H2 along with the tentative recovery in external demand across the globe, we caution that private consumption will nevertheless remain subdued, thus constraining the economy's ability to avert a protracted downturn. Indeed, according to latest data, a slight improvement in industrial output was recorded in July, with production expanding by 4% month-on-month , after growing by 3% m-o-m in June. This was driven primarily by a surge in steel output, which expanded by 15% m-o-m amidst a tentative return of external demand . We note, however, that with economic activity beginning to pick up in the more developed states of Western Europe, Ukraine's export sector will also be given a slight boost asa consequence of the ongoing depreciation of the hryvnia, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. In contrast, the fact that latest retail sales data from the State Statistics Committee shows a contraction of 21% y-o-y in July underscores our relatively bleak outlook for household consumption. With the private sector set to account for years of excessive borrowing through a prolonged period of deleveraging, and unemployment spiralling higher, the ability of the Ukrainian consumer to drive growth will remain impaired. Compounded with ongoing instability in the banking sector, which has seen the domestic lending channel seize up, the outlook is certainly bleak. Accordingly, as private household consumption accounts for approximately 60% of total GDP, we are confident that the economy's recovery process through 2010 will be weak. Although we forecast real GDP expanding by 1% next year, we maintain our core view that this will be a reflection of low base effects as opposed to any uptick in economic activity. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 Macroeconomic Outlook Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Investment And UEFA Given Ukraine's commitment to hosting the Euro 2012 football championships, ongoing data releases showing a steep decline in fixed investment is of particular concern, and does not bode well for the country's medium-term growth outlook. Indeed, official data for the first quarter of the year show GFCF contracting by 48% y-o-y, well below the 19% rate of growth recorded in Q108. This highlights the scope of the macroeconomic crisis engulfing the country. With both private consumption and exports set to remain subdued beyond 2009, large-scale investments to underlying transportation infrastructure and the hospitality industry in the run-up to the championship will play an increasingly important role in supporting growth. That said, with ongoing quarrels in parliament continuing to jeopardise the states ability to make progress in its preparation efforts, there is a growing risk that three of the four cities will lose their right to host the championship. Indeed, during their latest visit to Ukraine, UEFA officials cautioned authorities that ongoing delays in the construction of key infrastructure was jeopardising Ukraines ability to host the championship. Moreover, in September there was still uncertainty surrounding President Yushchenko's vetoing of recently passed legislation. The legislation sought to have the National Bank of Ukraine transfer funding for the championship over to the state budget. There were questions about how this situation would play out. While we hold to our projection that real GDP growth will average 3% between 2011-2013, we caution that a UEFA decision to strip one or more of these cities of this right could necessitate a slight downward revision to our forecast.

It is also a major producer of olefins, polyolefins and other petrochemicals. KarpatNaftoKhim was established in October 2004 after closure of the main facilities of the JV Lukor. In June 2006, Lukoil-Neftekhim announced plans to invest an additional US$100mn in the statutory fund of KarpatNaftoKhim, if it agreed to sign an amicable agreement after disputes regarding operations. KarpatNaftoKhim operates a petrochemicals complex at Kalush in Ukraine. The closed-end JSC Lukor was established by Lukoil-Neftekhim and the Ukrainian open-end JSC Oriana on December 6 2000, with a statutory fund of UAH1bn . Lukoil-Neftekhim had a 52% stake in the project, while Oriana held the remaining 48%. Lukoil has been one of the largest investors in the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. KarpatNaftoKhim is the nations only producer of LDPE and VCM and a major producer of ethylene, propylene, benzene, caustic soda and other petrochemicals products. It has the capacity to produce 100,000 tonnes of PE, 370,000 tonnes of VCM and 250,000tpa of ethylene. The company exports most of its petrochemicals products to Russia, the EU and Turkey. In March 2008, KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of a new PVC plant in Kalush. Around US$210mn is being invested to establish Ukraines first PVC production facility, with planned capacity of 300,000tpa. Uhde has been appointed the contractor for the plant. The new unit was expected to be completed and operating some time during 2009. However, the slump in the PVC market casts doubt on the operations viability. It could be delayed until 2010. The KarpatNaftoKhim plant would produce plastic for windows and aluminium window profiles, which Ukraine currently does not produce. The investment is in addition to the US$600mn that Lukoil-Neftekhim is investing in the construction of a chlor-alkali plant also at Kalush. KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of the new plant in June 2007. The new facility will have capacity to produce about 206,000tpa of caustic soda and 181,000tpa of chlorine, and was originally expected to come online in Q208. However, the plants opening has been repeatedly postponed, with KarpatNaftoKhim announcing a further delay in March 2009. The plant is now scheduled to come onstream in Q309. The outlook for the petrochemicals is so poor, however, that there is a chance that these projects will be further delayed, or even abandoned. KarpatNaftoKhim already reportedly suspended operations temporarily in July 2008, owing to a decline in demand for ethylene.

By the end of 2006, five production units had been set up, including a foamed PS facility. The PS facility has led to an increase in capacity to 50,000tpa. Stirol stopped its ammonia-producing workshop to conduct major repair work, owing to a breakdown that took place on September 11 2006. In 2007, Stirols export of urea grew by 23%, urea-ammonia solutions by 221%, PS by 35%, sodium nitrate by 38%, sodium nitrite by 5% and amino resins by 52%. The companys gross revenue increased by 18% y-o-y in 2007. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation rose by 18% to UAH364mn, while earnings before interest and taxes rose by 22% to UAH280mn. In the first eight months of 2008, Stirol reportedly increased sales and production volumes for all its primary final products. The company website also reported that growth rates were maintained despite the economic crisis. In October 2008, ammonia production was up 4% y-o-y and urea production was up 3%.

Linos had been TNK-BPs main refinery asset in Ukraine. Russian oil group TNK owned a 78% stake in the Linos oil refinery and petrochemicals complex situated in the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine. TNK-BP was formed in 2003 by the merger of TNK and BPs Russian arm and has interests in Ukraines downstream sector. The company has a 78% interest in the afore mentioned 320,000b/d Linos refinery, although its actual share of production is lower. The facility also incorporates the countrys sole polypropylene facility. In addition, TNK-BP operates a network of over 925 franchised service stations. The firm also owns a share of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline, which supplies the Pivdennyi Oil Export Terminal. While there is no upstream exposure and little scope for the Anglo-Russian group to establish a presence, the company is strong in refining and fuels distribution. All Ukraines refineries operate well below design capacity, are relatively inefficient and lack complexity. TNK-BP has an opportunity to upgrade, raise throughput and feed a growing chain of outlets as the local market grows. However, the investment climate in Ukraine remains uncertain, which will be a concern for BP in particular. TNK-BP corporate centre in Ukraine manages the groups enterprises, including sales and production facilities and investment companies. The complex includes a cracker with an ethylene production capacity of 300,000tpa that is also capable of producing propylene, as well as the countrys only PP plant. However, in February 2006, it was reported that TNK-BP had stopped using the services of Linos. The agreement with Linos on the lease of the refinery has been cancelled. From January 1 2006, TNK-BP has been refining its oil in Ukraine at the Lisichansk oil refinery, owned and managed by CJSC LINIK. In November 2006, the Lisichansk oil refinery announced a planned processing capacity of about 260,000 tonnes of oil. The plant had undergone an annual maintenance turnaround procedure to rebuild the reactor block and to replace the vacuum gas-oil catalyser of the catalytic cracking unit. The project also included replacing the piping of the hydrogen furnaces, the control equipment and system for oil-processing. In April 2007, TNK-BP outlined plans to invest around US$400mn in its operational and marketing assets development in Ukraine in 2007-2010. It has suggested the scale of investment will depend on the countrys investment climate. Executives have complained the government has dragged out negotiations over refining investment, with little progress since mid-2006. The main reason for the delays is the deteriorating political situation, which is undermining the business environment. TNK-BP claims that the government owes it US$64mn in VAT refunds and is dragging its feet on repayment, owing to political issues concerning the governments financial programme. TNK-BP said in early 2009 that it had completed upgrades on its Lysychansk refinery, which would see the plant through to 2010, and was considering investing some US$41mn in 2009 to modernise its Linos refinery. The company also announced its intentions to maintain production Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 TNK-BP Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 levels of oil products in 2009, despite falling consumption. TNK-BP, which refined 10mn tonnes of gas and oil condensates in 2008, hopes to pick up the slack from declining imports.

Source: ILO, BMI Table: Average Annual Wages, 2000-2012 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 BMIs industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variables own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variables own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historic data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Plant Capacity The ability of a country to produce basic chemical products depends on domestic plant capacity. The number and size of ethylene crackers determines both a countrys likely output, and also its relative efficiency as a producer. We therefore examine: Stated year-end capacity for key petrochemicals products, mainly ethylene, but also propylene, polypropylene, polyethylene and so forth. Government, company and third-party sources are used; Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts Chemicals and Petrochemicals Industry Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q2 2010 Specific company and/or government capacity expansion projects aimed at increasing the number and/or size of crackers and downstream processing facilities. Chemicals Supply A mixture of methods is used to generate supply forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Basic plant capacity and historic utilisation rates. Unless a company imports chemicals products for domestic re-sale, supply is expected to be governed by production capacity; Underlying economic growth trends. The chemicals industry is highly cyclical. Strong domestic or regional demand should be met by increased supply and higher plant utilisation rates; Third-party projections from national and international industry trade associations. Chemicals Demand Various methods are used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Underlying economic growth trends. The chemicals industry is highly cyclical. Strong domestic or regional demand is expected to require larger volumes of either domestically produced or imported olefins , polyolefins or downstream products; Trends in end-user industries. Strong demand for motor vehicles, construction materials, packaging products and pharmaceuticals imply rising demand for basic chemicals; Government/industry projections; Third-party forecasts from national and international industry trade associations etc. Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third party agency projections with the reported spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data, such as physical spending patterns ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the chemicals balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place.

First, we have defined the risks rated in order to accurately capture the operational dangers to companies operating in this industry globally. Second, we have, where possible, identified objective indicators. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a nuanced manner in order to ensure that only the aspects most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the ratings system which integrates with those of all industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. The ratings system divides into two distinct areas, with the indicators included in each area stated below: Limits Of Potential Returns Evaluation of sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development. Risks To Realisation Of Returns Evaluation of industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of anticipated returns being realised over the assessed time period.

df4629b8-d200-4f11-805b-ba1075bd5cef,"MOSCOW -- Belarus escalated an energy price dispute with Russia on Monday, raising concerns about midwinter disruptions in the flow through a pipeline system that supplies about 10% of the European Union's oil. The dispute focuses on the Soviet-era Druzhba system, the main route for Siberian petroleum to Europe. Russia began curbing supplies through the pipeline to Belarus's domestic market after a pricing deal between the two countries expired Dec. On Monday, Russian officials said those deliveries had been resumed, but not before Belarus threatened to cut off electricity to Russia's westernmost region if the Russians insisted on imposing a new tax on the oil Belarus processes for export. Russia's top energy official, Igor Sechin, said European customers were unaffected by the dispute and that Russian crude was flowing normally through the pipeline. But he emphasized that Russia and Belarus had yet to clinch an agreement. Three years ago, Russia briefly cut oil exports to Europe through a Belarussian pipeline as the two countries quarreled over price. That, along with a January 2009 natural-gas cutoff to Europe caused by disputes with Ukraine, raised doubts in Europe about Russia's dependability as a top energy supplier. The oil dispute poses less of a threat to European countries, which have stockpiles in place and options, such as sea shipments, for receiving new crude. But Russia's new position could prove costly for Belarus, a former Soviet republic that has counted Moscow as its top ally. The majority of the Druzhba pipeline's crude -- about 37 million tons annually -- goes through Belarus to refineries in Poland and eastern Germany, which depend on the pipeline for nearly all of their crude. Belarus keeps and refines an additional 21million tons of crude for itself and European customers, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Until now, Moscow has taxed Belarus at about one-third its rate for international customers for the crude Belarus refines domestically. Belarus has used about eight million tons of the refined oil domestically each year and exported the rest at a hefty profit. Now Russia is demanding that Belarus pay full customs duties on the refined oil it doesn't consume domestically, in line with a broader policy of bringing market pricing for its energy supplies. The new tax could cost Belarus an estimated $5 billion this year, more than 10% of its gross domestic product, Belarussian experts told the Associated Press. On Monday, Belarus upped the ante by threatening to interrupt electricity transfers to Russia's Kaliningrad region, a Baltic Sea enclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. A statement issued by Belarus's Belenergo energy company said the two countries lacked an agreement governing those transfers in 2010. A spokesman for Inter RAO UES, the Russian operator of power exports and imports, said Belarus was trying to ""blackmail Russia through the media."" Relations between the former Soviet neighbors have been increasingly strained by financial disputes. Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko has accused Russia of bullying his country of 10 million people and trying to acquire some key industrial assets. Belarus has limited leverage to confront Moscow over Druzhba, which means friendship. Russia is building a second phase of the Baltic Pipeline System, scheduled to be completed in 2012, which would route oil around Belarus to Europe via the Baltic Sea. ""This is Belarus's last opportunity to strike a bargain before that pipeline gets completed,"" says Matthew Sagers, a Eurasia specialist at Cambridge Energy. ""But Russia holds all the cards."" Oil prices rose Monday to $81 a barrel, the highest in more than two months, partly because of the Russia-Belarus dispute. Credit: By William Mauldin and Richard Boudreaux"
ed3737e7-40e6-4ea7-b2e1-b4cf617b689b,"ABSTRACT Before the World War II, the US policy was a compound of cooperation and isolation towards the world affairs and the US has no direct link in Southwest Asia and this area was under British influence. The main reason was lack of American commercial interests in Afghanistan and the role of Britain as guardian of Afghan foreign affairs, which obviated an early meaningful relationship between the two countries. So the history of US-Afghan relations is not very long and the efforts of the Afghan government for establishing relationship were not cherished up until 1934 and formal diplomatic relations were established in 1942. Afghanistan continued its traditional and preferred role as a buffer state, which prevented it from going into the orbit of any superpower or joining any military alliance. However, the Soviet influence increased and the Soviets provided military training and arms supply to Afghan army. The US adopted flexible approach in its relations with the Soviets, which resulted in increasing influence of communism and ultimately, Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan on December 27, 1979, which totally altered the geo-strategic situation. Pakistan became a frontline state and the US made arrangements to supply military assistance to resistance groups without its direct involvement. In 1981, President Reagan took power with his tough anti-communist stance and made Moscow pay a high military and political price for the intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet left Afghanistan after signing Geneva Accords in February 1989. In the absence of a central government, a civil war erupted which brought the Taliban in power. The paper will explore historical events which led to the events of 9/11 and war on terrorism in Afghanistan. KEY WORDS : US, World War II, US-Afghan Relations, Soviet Union, Cold War, Boundary Issue, , SEATO, CENTO, RCD, SALT I, SALT II, PDPA, CIA, ISI, UN, Geneva Accords, MI24, MI25, NSDD 166, Al Qaeda Introduction The foreign policy of the United State is largely shaped by its geographical and historical considerations. Its political and social systems as well as economic and military powers determine its position in the world politics. The policies of other states and international environment are influenced by its power. Before the World War II, the US policy was a compound of cooperation and isolation. The lack of American commercial interests in Afghanistan and the role of Britain as guardian of Afghan foreign affairs obviated an early meaningful relationship between the two countries. So the history of US-Afghan relations is not very long, though both states gained their independence in the same period, nearly two hundred years ago. The paper shall analyze the historical perspective of those events which appeared in the form of 9/11. The United States extended recognition to Afghanistan in 1934 but formal diplomatic relations were established in 1942. George Washington, the first president of the United States, advised his nation to avert ""entangling alliances"" while delivering his farewell address and the US adopted this policy . The United States changed its policy of isolation in the beginning of the twentieth century as the address of President William McKinley showed the new role of America that ""God and men have linked nations together, no nation can longer be indifferent to any other"" . The next half-century passed in planning for seeking American political engagement in world affairs to promote a stable international order favorable for the US interests. As for as the US interests are concerned, Afghanistan had never been important for it. So, the efforts of the Afghan government for establishing relationship were not cherished. However, the former King Amanullah of Afghanistan made rapid efforts in this direction and sent personal emissary to explore the possibility of establishing friendly relations with the US. In July 1921, another Afghan mission visited the United States to provide ample opportunities for American businessmen to invest in Afghanistan but Charles.E.Hughes, the US Secretary of State, rejected this offer because he considered Afghanistan under the British sphere of influence 1. The other reason was friendly relations of Afghanistan with Germany. This country fought against America in the World War I, so it did not look with favour on Afghan-German activities. Afghan Efforts for Recognition in Zahir Shah's Era The US reluctance to establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan was evident from a letter of the State Department in 1933: ""We have been naturally conservative on the subject of establishing relations with Afghanistan owing to the primitive conditions in the country, the lack of capability or the guarantees to the safety of foreigners and the absence of any important American interests"" . After the downfall of Amanullah, the process for recognition between Afghanistan and the United States suffered a set back. In 1933, King Zahir Shah became the ruler of Afghanistan who gave a new turn to the foreign policy and made special efforts to get economic assistance and recognition for his country from the US. He sent a letter to the US President Roosevelt expressing his desire for political and economic relations with America. Replying this letter, Roosevelt assured the King of friendly relations and accorded the recognition to Afghanistan . The US recognition of Afghanistan led to the signing of a formal agreement in 1937, which marked the beginning of the economic cooperation between Kabul and Washington. Relations of Afghanistan with the Soviet Union and the Great Britain suffered a lot due to Afghan-German friendship. So, it was quite natural for Afghan government to develop cordial relations with the United States and for this purpose it offered concessions for American companies to explore oil resources. The Afghan government granted its first concession to the American Inland Exploration Company by offering a 75 years option for the exploration of oil resources. However, the company abandoned its work in 1938 after a year, as it was not economically feasible . The other reason was the attitude of the Soviet Union that tried to disrupt the supply of American material through the Soviet rail tracks. Moscow regarded Afghanistan under its sphere of influence and hence it disliked a third country to become its rival. World War II and Its Effects The outbreak of the World War II adversely affected the economy of Afghanistan, which was already in the worst condition. Afghanistan remained neutral during the war, despite having strong relations with Germany, Italy and Japan. But its exports to these countries were almost stopped as western markets were badly affected due to war and America became the market of Karakul skins and fruits. Afghanistan began to export skins and fruits to American markets, which continued till late 1950s when the Karakul skins became outdated . After the World War II, the United States changed its 1930s policy of isolationism and started framing its political role in the world affairs through the policy of interventionism. The American diplomatic mission was inaugurated in Kabul on June 6, 1942. W.H.Van Engert was appointed as the first American ambassador and Muhammad Naim was sent to the United States to present his credentials as Afghan ambassador in Washington . In December 1942, the State Department made a proposal of constructing a motorable road passing through India, Afghanistan and Soviet Union to reach China. The US officials reached in the region to explore the possibility of project, but the Soviet Union refused to allow entry of any American national on its territory and Afghans were also reluctant to join the scheme and so the plan was abandoned . The United States continued its economic assistance in the other projects and American-engineers were sent to Kabul to assist in irrigation plans. The American government urged Afghanistan to use opium only in medicine and other scientific purposes. Afghanistan was a big opium producer and American drug-lords had contacts with Afghan drug-dealers for supply of opium, which was against the US policy of banning drugs. The Afghan government acceded to the American request and banned the production of opium . After the World War II, the era of good feeling lingered and the United States became ideal substitute of the Great Britain for Afghanistan. Afghanistan welcomed the new American role for world's peace and democracy. These feelings were conveyed to the State Department through Afghan Prime Minister, Shah Mahmood Khan. In return the State Department admitted that Afghanistan ""is also strategically important for the United State's policy in the Middle East"" . Cold War Policy of US The Cold War policy of the US was primarily to face and stem the advance of Soviet Union into Europe. The Soviet Union was extending its influence in Europe and Asia. Afghanistan being at the border of Soviet Union was not strategically significant for the US. But it continued economic assistance to Afghanistan. An American company Morrison Khundson signed a contract with the government of Afghanistan worth $17 million for repairing dams, construction of reserves, canals and power plants in the Helmond Valley of Southern Afghanistan. It was a multipurpose project and Japanese engineers made its initial survey. The project fell short of foreign exchange and assistance. Afghan foreign minister Zabuli visited Washington for the loan of $118 million but the US Export Import Bank sanctioned only a loan of $21 million, which was not sufficient to meet the need of the project. Zabuli recommended his government to decline the loan. But Afghan officials overruled him, as they wanted to establish close economic ties with the US. The project failed due to bad quality of soil and lack of funds . However, the Cold War increased importance of Afghanistan in the eyes of the US. Like the British, during the Great Game of 19th century, the United States also feared that ambitious and expansionist Soviet Union might gain predominant influence in Afghanistan and then press southwards to warm waters of the Arabian Sea. But the United States was not in favor of arming Afghanistan. Despite frequent requests of Kabul who wanted American weapons to modernize its armed forces in the wake of possible Soviet danger and took plea that US-backed Afghanistan would defend Western interests against Soviet threat. But these requests were unheeded and in 1949, disappointed Afghan officials were forced to say that ""unless US gave Afghanistan more assistance Afghanistan might turn to USSR"" . At this point, the US embassy in Kabul recommended its government for the sale of weapons to Afghanistan to exclude Soviet influence. Other reason was the settlement of Pak-Afghan disputes. Washington was much concerned with strategic significance of Pakistan, while it considered Afghanistan a remote, small, poor and unimportant country with a few natural resources . So, Washington misgauged the strategic importance of Afghanistan. It was wrongly assessed that ""Afghanistan's little assets had no worth for the Kremlin, who could easily take Afghanistan to its broader objectives"" So the initial American worry about Afghanistan had not arisen from any action of the Soviet Union, but from the Pushtunistan issue because Afghan government wanted an independent Pathan State by challenging the Durand line 2. Pakistan was in a strong geopolitical position to exert pressure on Kabul. The landlocked Afghanistan depended on transit route through Pakistan for the bulk of its trade with rest of the world. Pak-Afghan Boundary Issue and US Response The Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian affairs, George McGhee visited Kabul in March 1951 and discussed military assistance and Pushtunistan issue with Muhammad Daoud, the minister of war, but easy solution to the problem could not be pursued. McGhee feared that recourse to the United Nations for Pak-Afghan boundary dispute would invite the Soviet involvement. McGhee had warned that this problem, as all other problems, must be considered in the light of expansionist policy of the Soviet Union, which had no hesitation in taking advantage of the power vacuums in Asia as well as in Europe. He also doubted the value of bilateral talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan . Increasing American involvement in this region revived the Soviet Union's interest that assumed Afghanistan in its sphere of influence as both countries had a long history of relations since old days. So Nikita Khurchev said that ""It was clear that America was courting Afghanistan. The Americans were undertaking all kinds of projects at their own expenses."" He further remarked: ""In my opinion the capital we have invested in Afghanistan has not been wasted. We have earned the Afghan trust and it has not fallen to American trap"" . The American anxiety increased after outbreak of the Korean War and fears of a more aggressive Soviet posture increased in Asia. The US offered both the countries to solve the Pushtunistan issue. It is proposed that Kabul and Karachi must cease propaganda attacks and seek to avoid tribal tension and resolve these problems through diplomatic channels. But Afghanistan's attitude was unreasonable and the US did not find any justification for the Afghan position on Pushtunistan issue. This was the basic reason that Afghanistan was not successful in getting American weapons. The other was the inability of Afghanistan as the State Department offered weapons on cash payment. Afghanistan called it a political refusal . Washington was worried about chronic friction between Pakistan and Afghanistan over their differences. In 1952, the US made many efforts to solve the issue through dialogue but Afghanistan was not willing to improve relations with Pakistan. The US withdrew its support for settling the boundary issue on the assessment of American embassy in Moscow. The Soviet Union was dissatisfied with the present situation. It was unlikely to develop a more active US policy in the country under present circumstances where Soviet objective was sufficiently served by the existing isolation and backwardness of the country . In 1952, Washington dropped both Afghanistan and Pakistan from its foreign policy agenda due to unsettled issue of Pushtunistan and economic aid. But the Soviet Union began to grow its influence in Afghanistan and helped in oil exploration. Afghan government made a plan to construct the modern roads. For this project, it requested the United States to provide $1 million worth of economic aid but the State Department did not take it seriously. After disappointment from the United States, the Afghan government turned to the Soviet Union who was already ""within gate"" . The available evidence showed that Washington had not taken seriously the involvement of the Soviet Union and expressed only moral support for Afghanistan. It did not apprehend any danger of Afghanistan's falling into Soviet camp. Dulles Policies: Ignoring Afghanistan In the year of 1953, John Foster Dulles had taken over the charge of Secretary of State and Sardar Muhammad Daoud became the prime minister of Afghanistan in the same year. Dulles gave a new impetus to the Cold War policies by establishing defense alliances with active American supporters . The United States wanted to stem the expansion of Communism in the world and particularly in South Asian regions. So it developed diplomatic relations with those countries that were geographically linked with the Soviet Union and China. Under new policies of 1954, the US began to provide massive economic and military assistance to Pakistan, which made Afghan government quite uneasy. The Afghan ambassador in Washington expressed his fears to Secretary Dulles as well as to Henry Byroade, the successor of McGhee, that American arms would make Pakistan intransigent and create a military imbalance in the region. He urged Americans to provide arms to Afghanistan as well . In the later years, Afghan foreign minister, Prince Naim visited Washington and communicated his country's interest in American arms by expressing deep anxiety over Soviet intervention. He also showed interest in joining the Northern Tier security arrangement that was taking shape among Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Iraq in the form of the South East Asia Treaty Organization and Baghdad pact. The response of the State Department was negative due to its concern about the Soviets as well as Pakistani reaction. Washington doubted that whether it would be wise to include Kabul in any alliance or to provide it American weapons. Pakistan became the member of both alliances. In 1955, Washington's concerns grew again when Afghanistan reacted against the decision of Pakistan for establishing 'One Unit' by eliminating its four western provinces. In reaction, agitated Afghan mob attacked Pakistani embassy in Kabul and its Consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad. In return, Pakistan closed its border with Afghanistan and imposed embargo on Afghan goods, which caused anxiety in Washington that the ""embargo might drive Afghanistan into Soviet arms"" . Diplomacy worked and normal relations resumed between Karachi and Kabul. But this trouble developed Soviet interests in the region and its leaders Nikita Khrushev and Nikolai Bulganin visited Afghanistan in December 1955 and offered $100 million economic assistance on a low interest rate along with military aid. The Soviet Union announced its aid due to Afghan position on Pushtunistan issue. At this, American ambassador in Kabul concluded that Afghanistan had become a complete economic satellite of the Soviet Union . In this way, the Soviet Union tried to check flourishing American interest through RCD and CENTO in South Asia. The Eisenhower administration was not ready to give up its interest in Afghanistan and it pressurized Pakistan to talk with Afghanistan. The US wanted to prevent Afghanistan from going under Soviet control, which had received major arms consignment after economic assistance. Daoud played a vital role for increasing Soviet influence. He announced that transit question was a secondary issue and it would not be resolved until the settlement of political question of Pushtunistan . But in the end, he agreed to explore the American proposals and received economic aid to improve the roads and warehouses inside Afghanistan. Pakistan and United States repeatedly made attempts to improve relations with Kabul. They wanted to draw Afghanistan away from the Soviet Union to bring it towards the free world. But the tension over Pushtunistan remained a stumbling block in the way of friendly relations with Pakistan and the United States. Dulles, the Secretary of State, was not in favor of Daoud and was obsessed with his downfall. He considered him pro-Soviet and suggested that American government should pressurize Afghan King to dismiss Daoud . This image of Daoud was due to American Ambassador Ward who had been taken as a hostage by some Chinese, when he was a Consul-General. Ward had suspected the hidden hand of Daoud in this incident and he played dubious role by sending such assessment, which influenced the State Department in adopting hostile attitude and personal grudge towards Daoud. Later Ward had to change his opinion about Daoud when the latter cleared his position regarding his captivity. Ward tried to convince the State Department but it was too late to alter the thinking of it . American policy makers thought that economic aid, arms deal and the visit of Soviet leaders to Afghanistan are evidence enough to prove that Afghanistan had become a Soviet Satellite. Though Afghan leaders clarified the situation and declared that Afghanistan would never accept 'satellite' status. It became true in the later years. In 1956, when the American National Security Council was discussing Afghanistan, President Eisenhower observed: ""one sentiment of today world is nationalism which is significant for Afghanistan who are loosing their national identity."" So, the US used the cards of nationalism and Muslim religion because it was unable to compete with the Soviet Union through economic aid to Afghanistan. Kabul welcomed the Eisenhower Doctrine . Under this Doctrine, the US adopted the policy of global containment of Communism. Afghanistan welcomed the policy but kept its traditional policy of neutrality. At the same time Afghanistan remained hopeful for further strengthening of Afghan-US relations. Inclination towards Soviet Union Afghanistan resumed its traditional and preferred role as a buffer state, which prevented it from going into the orbit of any power or joining any military alliance. The Cold War enabled Kabul to get more than $1 billion of economic aid from both super powers. Both Soviets and Americans built modern roads connecting the major cities of Afghanistan. The Soviets also constructed grain soils and supplied arms and provided military training to Afghan army. Thousands of military officers attended military colleges in the Soviet Union while hundreds got training in America 3. The US focused its attention on the improvement of agriculture, bureaucracy and education in Afghanistan and took a little interest in the regional politics due to its policy of 'brinkmanship.' This policy is evident from a State Department's report in which it advised that ""Afghans to be wise in action or statements against Soviets, as it was impractical for the United States to meet Afghanistan's requirements for security and economic aid"" . This shift in policy occurred in the late 1950s, when the US began to assume a more flexible approach in its relations with the Soviet Union, neutral nations and other allied countries. In June 1958, Daoud paid an official visit to America and expressed his desire to maintain cordial relations between the two countries. In December 1959, President Eisenhower stopped over Kabul, during his trip to South Asia, where he was received warmly. This visit was important in the sense that Afghanistan was not a member of the US-sponsored military alliances. The president provided financial and technical assistance of $10 million as a loan for construction of Kabul Airport . At that time American position on Afghanistan was to maintain its independence and kept it away from the danger of growing Soviet influence. Recent published documents have evidences that Afghanistan strove earnestly for American aid but the US remained reluctant to accede to Afghanistan's request for the supply of weapons. The US policy was mainly dominated by Pakistan factor that was the member of CENTO and SEATO. Moreover, Pushtunistan issue deteriorated the situation and America never complied with the request. The other reason was Washington's fear that sending military equipments to Afghanistan would alarm the Soviet Union. By the 1960s, two Cold War rivals continued their economic assistance to Afghanistan. The country appeared to be well on road towards becoming a Central Asian Finland, a non-Communist state but important to the security concerns of its Communist neighbour. During the Kennedy administration, friction and differences continued between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Afghanistan closed its borders with Pakistan. At that time Afghan Foreign Minister Muhammad Naim, who was in America, requested for the grant of loan for the construction of overland route through Iran to avoid dependence upon Moscow. President Kennedy not only rejected his request but also insisted on resolving disputes with Pakistan. However, Shah of Iran, who was a close friend of Washington, settled this dispute. Kennedy's personal intervention also paved the way to resolve the tension as he asked King Zahir Shah ""to soften their stance and resume trade"" . In 1964, Sardar Daoud was ousted from the government as the new Afghan constitution of 1964 banished royal family from power. However, during this period, the Soviets were gradually gaining influence in Afghanistan through its multipurpose aid. Political freedom also permitted the emergence of small Communist political parties in Afghanistan. The US who had been advocating democracy and freedom all the time, did not encourage or provide any support for the democratic reforms of king Zahir Shah. In the 1970s, Washington and Moscow adopted the policy of détente4, which reduced tension between the super-powers. America decreased its assistance to the region. The United States went back to its pre-1955 policy, which was assessed in 1972 by a report of the US ambassador, Neuman who served Afghanistan from 1967 to 73. He summed up: ""For the United States, Afghanistan has at present a limited direct interest; it is not an important trade partner. There are no treaty ties or defence commitment"" . The strategic location of Afghanistan was important for the US due to its neighbouring states of Central Asia and Indian sub-continent. End of Monarchy in Afghanistan The US policy was responsible to turn Afghanistan to the Soviet Union who provided $552 million between 1955-65, while the US aid of the same period was $350 million and it made no special efforts to give assistance from 1965 to 73 . The Soviet aid program increased its influence and changed thinking of Afghan people who were being impressed by Communism. These pro-Soviet people formed a Communist organization with the name of the People Democratic Party of Afghanistan in 1965 and Noor Muhammad Taraki; a Communist Afghan leader became its first Secretary General. This party played a vital role in bringing Daoud into power and ousted Zahir Shah through a military coup in 1973. Daoud became president and abolished monarchy by declaring Afghanistan a republic. Returning of Daoud to power renewed trouble between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Kabul resurrected the Pushtunistan issue and supported the insurgency in Balochistan by providing money and arms. In return, Z.A.Bhutto, the prime minister of Pakistan, gave shelter and training to anti-Daoud commandos. An Afghan cell was created for support of Islamic movement, which later fought with Soviet troops. The American reaction to coup was not very harsh due to its policy of détente. President Nixon avoided involving in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Other reason was the US interest in the Middle East where he wanted to improve the situation. He tried to relax tension through Strategic Arms Limitation Talks . The purpose of these talks was to check the atomic arms race . Henry Kissenger, the Secretary of State, visited Afghanistan in 1974 and discussed with Daoud a wide range of issues including South Asian region, détente and mutual affairs for peaceful and stable world. Henry Kissenger also stressed upon Daoud to adopt the traditional policy of neutrality and non-alignment to improve friendly relations with the United States and other Western countries. Henry Kissenger also convinced the Middle East countries to provide aid to Afghanistan. Shah of Iran also supported the American efforts to keep Daoud away from the Soviet Union through massive financial aid . This pattern of friendship continued in the Carter era too. However private sector was reluctant to invest in Afghanistan due to its primitive position and distant location. The other reason was visible presence of the Soviets. Daoud accepted this policy, as he was an autocratic nationalist rather then a leftist. During the last year of his government he made a noticeable shift in policy to reduce security dependence on Moscow and tried to diminish the political influence of Communists and leftists by excluding them from government agencies. He also accepted the American invitation to visit Washington in the summer of 1978 but this dream could not be fulfilled. Brezhnev, the secretary general of Communist party of the Soviet Union, called Daoud to Moscow to explain his position and asked him to reduce imperial influence by expelling his pro-American advisers. But Daoud rejected this proposal and declared that people of Afghanistan were ""master of their own houses and no foreign country could tell them how to run their affairs"" . No doubt, Moscow was disappointed as Daoud realized that Soviet embrace would turn into a bear hug. Both factions of PDPA, which were divided in 1976, now reunited against Daoud for his pro-western policies. The murder of a leading ideologue, Mir Akbar Khyber, worsened the situation. At his funeral, large-scale anti-US demonstrations were staged. Daoud arrested all prominent political leaders but committed a great blunder by sparing Communist army officers and leaders, who later played a key role in ousting him from power. The US policy towards Afghanistan remained remarkably consistent, under both King Zahir Shah and President Daoud. Annual policy review sent from the American Embassy in Kabul to the State Department contained a few modifications in the recommendations due to its geographic and strategic location . The policy remained basically unchanged until Communist coup in April 1978. Soviet Invasion and Its Consequences On April 27, 1978 Daoud was gunned down along with his family in a bloody coup, that brought the Communists to power and Afghanistan was proclaimed republic with Noor Muhammad Taraki as a new president. The US did not show any reaction and ignored Communist activity in this bloody drama. Washington's indifference and negligence was evident from a report of the State Department, which was issued on March 26, 1978. The report said that ""The political situation is stable in Afghanistan and President Daoud remains very much in control and faces no significant opposition"" . After the coup, Washington reacted mildly. This was due to its defeat in Vietnam and humiliation in Watergate scandal. The Carter administration regarded the change in Kabul, just like another Middle East style coup rather than a Communist takeover. The American Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance found no evidence of Soviet complicity in the coup despite there were sufficient reasons for doubts. The Soviets denied their involvement and Brezhnev told President Carter that the Soviets first heard of the coup on Radio Kabul and had not instigated it . The new Afghan government claimed to be non-aligned and non-communist and Washington accepted this claim. American Ambassador in Kabul and the State Department assessed the new regime in Kabul as more nationalist rather than Communist. The State Department instructed its embassy in Kabul that one option would be to phase out American activities in Afghanistan, but this would be unsettling for Afghanistan and its neighbours and incompatible with their policies. The new regime had accepted the US policies for maintaining its interest and presence . All Americans were not satisfied with government's attitude and its explanation about Afghanistan. They opposed the continued aid to the Communist regime. The former Ambassador Neumann told the State Department that he had known the new leaders for years and they were Communists and would follow order from Moscow. He differed with the viewpoint of other officers considering it a wrong perception of the Communist regime . The moderate policy of the US gave free hand to the Soviet Union who was intending to reduce American and Western influence in this region. Later on, the State Department admitted this fault and began to support Afghan Islamic groups, living in Pakistan. The US admitted that it was not in American interest to ""give such a blank cheque signed to Moscow"" . Moscow availed itself of the opportunity and Soviet experts occupied all fields including security and intelligence services. On the contrary, the United States continued its economic aid, which was provided till the death of American Ambassador Adolph Dubs in February 1979. Dubs was an expert in Soviet affairs and was appointed with the hope to support anti-communist forces. He was kidnapped by an anti-government group and was killed by police during rescue action. Police did not accept the opinion of American diplomats, who were present at the scene to make a deal with captors. During the rescue mission, captors were also killed. The American government protested against the methods applied by police and particularly the presence of Soviet advisors . Outraged President Jimmy Carter suspended the economic aid to Afghan government and increased financial support to Pakistan-based Islamic groups through the military regime of Pakistan. The American Central Intelligence Agency collaborated with Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence supported Afghan resistance groups, which emerged in Afghanistan in reaction to highly unpopular policies of the Communist regime. Taraki broke the country's long tradition of neutrality in favour of direct alliance with the Soviet Union. On domestic level, the government planned to introduce a social revolution based on massive land reforms by reducing rural debt. Instead of favor, the reforms met with suspicion and resistance by the public. The government responded with force and fighting broke out. Communist party PDPA divided between two factions of Khaliq and Parcham. Hafizullah Amin led Khalq while Tarkai headed Parcham. At the first anniversary of ""Sour Revolution"", an uprising erupted in Herat and the government suppressed it brutally. Agitation against the government spread in many provinces. In this resistance, US-sponsored Islamic and traditional groups joined demonstrators. Taraki requested the Soviet Union for help but it refused on the plea that ""This would play into hands of enemies, yours and ours"" . The Soviets avoided direct involvement as it could provide opportunity to the US to blame it for its expansionist policy. Other reason was distrust of Moscow in Hifizullah Amin who reduced Taraki to the status of figurehead. Taraki tried to kill him but could not succeed. In return, Amin imprisoned Taraki. Later on, Taraki was assassinated. Taraki's death infuriated the Soviet leaders particularly Brezhnev who burst into tears when he was told about Taraki's murder. He uttered that ""he had been given a slap in face to which he had to response"" . The response came in the form of Soviet invasion of December 1979. Amin seized political powers but the United States did not trust him and refused to provide any political support or economic assistance. Though Amin tried to assure American leaders of his loyalty and tried to resolve the complicated situation without Communist involvement. The reason for his incredibility and unpopularity with Americans was his cold and insulting behaviour on the death of Dubs. He did not sign the book of condolence and avoided to appear at the airport ceremony for sending the dead body. Soviet KGB and other intelligence agencies blamed Amin for deteriorating Afghan-Soviet relations and pleasing Washington with his pro-western policies. But American diplomats considered them ""routine"" . The United States also ignored the collection of Soviet troops and military equipments along the Afghan border. Reports about the possible invasion were also received by American intelligence but officers in Washington did not agreed with these reports. Disappointed with America, the president Amin made efforts to get support from Iran and Pakistan but it was too late and Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan on December 27, 1979, which totally altered the geo-strategic situation. Soviet troops murdered Amin and installed a Parcham leader Babrak Karmal. The invasion was the first direct use of Soviet troops outside the Iron Curtain to occupy a formal non-aligned state since the World War II. Invasion was an implication of Brezhnev Doctrine, which declared that a country that had entered the socialist bloc could not be allowed to leave whatever the justification might be. This affair entered the center stage of world politics. The United States, which had earlier ignored the rise of Communist regime in Afghanistan, suddenly woke up to the danger. To compete the Soviet invasion, President Carter outlined the ""Carter Doctrine"" in his state of the Union address. In this he viewed South West Asia as ""third strategic zone for Western security"". He called the invasion ""the most serious threat to peace since World War II."" In his warning to the Soviet Union, he announced: ""An attempt by outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States and such an assault will be repelled by all means necessary, including military force."" Carter warned Brezhnev to withdraw his forces from Afghanistan or face serious consequences 5. Carter proclaimed a boycott of the Moscow Olympics and suspended SALT II with the Soviet Union. He had imposed an embargo on sale of grain and modern technology to the Soviets. Fishing in American waters was curtailed for the Soviets. Diplomatic relations were postponed and Ambassador Thomas Watson was called back from Moscow. The Carter administration took every possible step against the Soviets, except direct military attack . Western media and American public, who were celebrating Christmas festivities, were shocked and raised questions about negligence and inability of their intelligence agencies. The State Department, President Carter or any other top official did not indicate such a situation as they all were favouring détente and strove to serve it, which proved a failed attempt. Contrary to it, the Soviets undermined all agreements and hopes. They tried to prove them as a dominant power in the globe. Another reason was difference of opinion between Carter's advisers of foreign affairs Vance and Brezezinski about the Soviet Union. Both provided different information and opinions, which made President unable to decide which of his two advisors was right as both were experts and competent in foreign affairs. Brezezinski was right in his judgment but Vance, the Secretary of State was reluctant to disturb Soviet-American relations without enough proofs . Asian countries also denounced the intervention and feared that the Soviet Union was on the march of seeking warm-water ports and threatening the Persian Gulf oilfield. Islamic world and non-aligned countries condemned the invasion. The United Nations passed a resolution, against the Soviet Union, which was vetoed by the Soviet Union in Security Council. At this General Assembly adopted the resolution on January 14, 1980 by the votes of 104 in favour and 18 against. The resolution called for immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops in order to enable its people to determine their own form of government . The most critical situation was inside Afghanistan. The arrival of foreign troops to protect the PDPA regime transformed the resistance into a popular Jihad. In this changed situation, civil war between competing Afghan groups became national liberation against the Communist power. Kabul itself became center of hostile activities including strikes, protests, sabotage, and assassination and bombing. One third of Afghanistan's population had to seek shelter outside the country mostly in Iran and Pakistan. The Resistance Groups and US Covert Aid Pakistan became a frontline state and the US made arrangements to supply military assistance to resistance groups without its direct involvement. President Carter announced an offer of $ 400 million aid for Pakistan but President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan rejected this offer as ""peanuts."" Other reason was American refusal to provide guarantee for protection of its frontiers, which was more important in the event of Soviet invasion. In 1981, President Reagan took power with his tough anti-communist stance. Opposition to the Soviets was the central focus of his foreign policy. He thought that Soviet military superiority was the result of détente and arms control agreement in general and SALT II in particular. He argued that the Soviets had cheated on all these agreements. He wanted to make Moscow pay a high military and political price for the intervention in Afghanistan. To meet Soviet threat, Reagan persuaded Congress to authorize $ 3billion for a five-year military aid program in 1981 for Pakistan . In addition to aid, the US officials sought to use Pakistan as a pipeline for funneling military and financial aid to the Mujahideen. President Zia agreed to the US proposal despite some apprehensions that such assistance might make Pakistan a target of the Soviet retaliation. However, Pakistan accepted this role for its own political interests. The ISI took responsibility for porting the military equipments among different factions who were fighting the Soviets. The CIA using American and Saudi funds provided military equipments. The Reagan administration had to choose Pakistan as it had little choice. Pakistan was the only feasible conduit for aid to resistance, as it had lengthy border with Afghanistan. Iran had also long border with Afghanistan but it was bitterly hostile to the US. Both countries had no military partnership after the 1979 revolution that brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power. The American aid against the Communist regime began to flow to Afghan resistance groups. These Islamist groups gained public support due to their call for Islamic unity and Jihad. These fighters became known as Mujahideen or holy warriors. These Pakistan-based Islamic groups had the connections with the outside world particularly Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries that provided massive aid in billions for their resistance. There were seven recognized parties backed by the US, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which had their base in Peshawar. These seven groups were divided into three moderate and four fundamentalist parties, two fundamentalist groups were more active and prominent, namely Jamat-i-Islami of Burhanuddin Rabbani and Hizb-i-Islami of Hikmatyar. The US and Pakistan refused to provide aid to any independent group fighting inside Afghanistan due to its non-alliance to Peshawar-based parties. These independent groups resented the policy of partiality by the CIA and the ISI. The protest of these groups seemed justified because of their direct combat with Red Army on one hand and Communist regime on the other. It was a common belief that bulk of military hardware and money were going to Peshawar factions particularly Hikmatyar, who received almost fifty percent of aid provided by the US and other countries. In the beginning, Washington had no objection at this distribution but in the later years, it showed resentment by calling Hikmatyar an opportunist. The US avoided direct confrontation with the Soviets and adopted the policy of covert aid to the resistance. In this connection, a study mission supported by Pentagon visited Pakistan and recommended supply of large number of weapons including missiles and landmines to the Mujahidin. But the State Department was not in favour of this recommendation because of its policy of ""plausible deniability. The Reagan administration continued to reiterate its claim that the Mujahidin were using weapons captured from Soviet soldiers. It was true to some extent but the most of weapons to Mujahidin were being supplied through the CIA and ISI, some Soviet weapons were captured while other were purchased from black market and Soviet-backed countries. Egypt was also major supplier, as these weapons were manufactured in its ordinance factories on demand of the US. In 1982, heavy casualties of Soviet troops inside Afghanistan infuriated Red Army who intensified its land and air attacks. These attacks resulted into a large number of casualties of resistant fighter. The resistance being an irregular force could not estimate the exact number of its casualties and the State Department also ignored the heavy loss of Afghan lives and kept its emphasis on the infliction of more damage to Soviet troops. In the light of above fact General Zia said that ""it does not care what happened to the Afghans afterwards"" . UN Efforts and Road to Geneva Accords The UN made considerable efforts for peace and settlement and its Secretary General paid first visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1981 and response was encouraging. He also met Brezhnev in Moscow, who complained that Pakistan refused to hold bilateral talks with Afghanistan under the pressure of the United States and China. He showed his willingness for political solution . Diego Cordovez, a dedicated and energetic diplomat was appointed Under Secretary General of the UN in August 1981. He made efforts to settle the controversial matters and took a number of initiatives. This consultation of 1981-82 made the outline of what later became the Geneva Accords. First separate discussion on Afghanistan between the Super powers held at Moscow in July 1982 . The Soviets expected that Reagan would work towards Detente as this policy gave them equal status with the US. Moscow was hopeful about Reagan, as Carter adopted tough policies in 1980. But all expectations regarding the lenient policy of Reagan ended in fiasco and he adopted harder attitude towards ""evil empire"" than his predecessor . Brezhnev died in 1982 without an agreement with Reagan on Afghanistan or any other issue. Yori Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev, was aware of Reagan's intransigence and saw little possibility of change in Reagan's attitude towards the Soviet expansionist policy in the Third World, particularly in Afghanistan. Andropov had opposed the Soviet invasion of 1979 and said, ""The invasion was a mistake and he would bring the boys back home if only the West would cooperate"" . This attitude was due to the worst results of invasion and its strain on Soviet economy. The invasion brought the setback to de`tente and loss of Soviet prestige in the world. Despite his changed thinking, he was unfortunate enough to preside over the worst year in Soviet-American relations since the Cuban-Missile crises of 1962. Under the UN efforts, talks began in Geneva in June 1982. Cordovez tried to remove controversy over the past differences among all parties by proposing different arrangements. First proposal was for non-interference and non-intervention between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Second, was on voluntary return of refugees. Third, arrangement was of obtaining a Soviet commitment for withdrawal of its forces. To satisfy the Soviets demand for American commitment to non-interference, Cordovez proposed the idea of guarantees to be provided by both superpowers . Any change in the status of Afghan regime was not mentioned. Both superpowers did not take negotiation very seriously. The Soviets were confident of their mighty forces equipped with the latest weapons. It misjudged the power of Mujahidin who were being supported by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States. The US was sure of military victory and did not take interest in the political solution of Afghan crisis. The State Department officials made disparaging remarks about Cordovez's mission . Andropov agreed to withdraw his forces under the auspices of the UN despite opposition from the armed forces and orthodox Communist leaders of Politburo. However, Pakistan and the United States were not ready to bargain with Andropov. As the Cold War was at its peak, so Washington deeply distrusted Soviet motives in the UN negotiations. The US adopted a hard policy towards the Soviet Union but Andropov gradually concluded that progress on Afghanistan would improve the relations between the super-powers. To ease the tension, he wrote to Reagan to talk on the subject of his choice: ""disarmament"" . Reagan replied positively but his advisors objected the draft. The reason of this hostile policy was attitude of William Casey, the director of the CIA within the Reagan administration who developed an aggressive attitude towards Afghan issue. The American Senate remarked that the administration was providing such quantity of aid to the Afghans, with which they ""can fight and die but not enough for them to win."" The State Department criticized this hostile policy of the CIA . In the later years, the US changed this policy and supplied heavy weapons to Mujahidin for military victory. Cordovez continued his efforts and paid visits to Kabul, Islamabad, Moscow and Washington where he held meeting to discuss the detail of draft for settlement of peace in Afghanistan. Pakistan avoided holding direct talks with Afghan regime, as it would give recognition to the regime and might affect the cause of resistance. The United States categorically expressed its willingness to cooperate in the process if there was a real commitment on the part of the Soviet Union to reach a settlement. In Geneva round of April 1983, a progress was made regarding timetable for withdrawal of troops. The Soviet Union promised ""gradual withdrawal and timeframe for it"". Cordovez announced that the agreement was ninety percent completed . Ailing Andropov died in February 1984 and was succeeded by aged and conservative Konstantin Chernenko. He refused to abandon the Kabul regime and continued Soviet support by increasing Soviet military operations. A large number of Soviet soldiers lost their lives that were the highest number of deaths during the conflict. In return, the US also pursued an aggressive strategy and increased the military aid to the Mujahidin to inflict more damage to the Soviets. Chernenko undermined the Geneva talks by rebuffing the United States and Pakistan. He not only refused to give a timetable for withdrawal but also rejected any commitment of such type in the future. He refused to send an advisor with Afghan delegate to Geneva. The Geneva round stalled and Afghanistan entered the deepest freez of the Cold War. He rejected Reagan's offer of the arms control talks and no change occurred in Soviet-American relations until the change of leadership . In the year of 1984, Cordovez indicated sharp differences of policy between Pakistan and the US on one hand, and the Soviet Union and the Kabul regime on the other. The US showed resentment to Pakistan for acceptance of bilateral arrangement with Afghanistan on non-interference without consultation of Washington. However, the US continued to provide covert aid to Mujahidin, as the Washington Post indicated that aid to Afghan resistance had mushroomed into the largest US covert operation since the Vietnam War . The Americans criticized the supply of aid and accused Islamabad and Afghan exiles for siphoning off many of the weapons. These allegations could affect the UN peace process. Such was the atmosphere, which surrounded the Geneva process . In 1984, Reagan once again won the presidential election and continued his efforts to improve relations with the Soviet Union but he became successful when Gorbachev succeeded Chernenko in March 1985. He was destined to become one of the most important political figures of the 20th century. He was one of those who had opposed the politburo's decision of intervention in Afghanistan. He had declared in 1983 while visiting Canada that invasion was a mistake . He objected the burden of war at the cost of domestic economic needs of the Soviet Union. Gorbachov began to seek a way out and kept withdrawal from Afghanistan at the top policy agenda. But first two years of Gorbachev's regime were paralleled by equal bitter conflicts in Washington. American policy makers wanted to upgrade the level of US aid to keep Soviet forces pinned down as long as possible. The State Department adopted an aggressive policy against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and President Reagan signed a secret directive NSDD 166, in March 1985 ""for arming Mujahidin to defeat the Soviets by all means available"" . American analysts gave opinion for increasing more military pressure along with the diplomatic initiatives to gauge the real intentions of the new Soviet leadership. Objections were raised not only on the supply of aid but also on the way in which it was being distributed by CIA and ISI. But the main target of the US was to inflict enough military damage and force the Soviets to leave Afghanistan. So, CIA gave importance to those parties whom it considered militarily effective. In this regard, Hikmatyar's party was given priority but the question remained in Washington about his effectiveness. The resistance leaders sent a delegation to the next round of Geneva talks in 1986, led by Burhanuddin Rabbani.They also paid a visit to the White House to meet Reagan . The Geneva negotiation, which had been moribund since 1983, got a new turn in the next rounds of 1985 and 1986. In these talks, Gorbachev agreed to join the US as a guarantor that was earlier refused by the Kremlin. While in Washington, the debate over the guarantee remained controversial. The US was not willing to talk about guarantee unless a schedule for the Soviets to walkout of Afghanistan was given. The widespread assessment in Washington was that there was no prospect or chance of Soviet withdrawal. The CIA analyzed in 1986 that ""general belief is that settlement is not going anywhere."" To gain a military victory it further suggested of equipping the Mujahideen with the Stingers missiles. The CIA wanted this weapon to counter the Soviet deployment of ""MI24"" and ""MI25"" assault helicopters in Afghanistan . The decision to supply Stingers was controversial and US army was afraid that Stingers were not enough for its own need. Some officials worried about Stingers falling into hands of Soviet terrorists while others did not want to lose ""plausible deniability"" and urged that introduction of such high tech American weaponry against Soviet forces could provoke a dangerous Soviet response against Pakistan . But the ISI insisted on the CIA to supply Stingers, which were necessary to attack the main target effectively. The ISI was right in its demand of Stingers, as this weapon reduced the Soviet air superiority in the battlefield and proved ideal for Afghan environment. Aid program under the Reagan Doctrine, the supply of Stingers and the implement of NSDD 166, all were part of that American policy under which Reagan raised the cost of war for the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, whereas Gorbachev reviewed the Soviet policy in accordance with his ""new thinking"" and said that counter revolution and imperialism had turned Afghanistan into a bleeding wound . He changed the policy due to cost of intervention in Afghanistan, which was more than $1 billion per year. He also suggested the change of leadership in Kabul, as the present leader was unable to tackle the situation. First Summit meeting on Afghan issue between Reagan and Gorbachev was held in Geneva in November 1985. Reagan reiterated his demand of withdrawal to improve the relations. Gorbachev responded positively but he also complained of the State Department's uncooperative attitude during the Geneva talks, which rejected the proposed agenda for agreements as calling it pre-mature . Actually the State Department was not taking Gorbachev's offer very seriously due to previous policy of the Soviet Union. To test Gorbachev's intention about withdrawal, the Secretary of State George Shultz asked the task force to devise a way. The task force recommended ""a high price for guarantee to the Soviets'' and demanded the Soviets to respond by setting a date for withdrawal of troops"". However, the State Department accepted the role of guarantor if the central issue of withdrawal and its relationship with other matters of settlement should be addressed and resolved properly . In settlement terms a guarantee means an aid cutoff, when withdrawal would begin. The US accepted this offer, as it foresaw no possibility of Soviet withdrawal. It further demanded that Gorbachev should demonstrate his sincerity about withdrawal in next Geneva talks by announcing timeframe for departure of his troops . The End Game and Emergence of Taliban All issues were settled in next Geneva talks of 1986 except timeframe and interim government. Gorbachev informed Najibullah, who succeeded Karmal that Soviets would not interfere in Afghanistan. So, Najibullah offered Mujahideen leaders to make a coalition government but all leaders rejected the proposal unanimously. Cordovez gave proposal for the establishment of a coalition government, comprising Afghan Mujahidin, refugees, selected Afghan personalities, PDPA and exiled Afghan leaders but this proposal was rejected by Washington, Islamabad and Mujahidin and they ruled out any dialogue with PDPA or any role for former King Zahir Shah . The United States wanted to build up the Peshawar-based alliance as a shadow government that could take over after the withdrawal. This policy was designed in 1987, as Washington hoped that Communist regime would fall soon after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. This assumption was adopted on reports of the CIA. Gorbachev sent a message to the State Department that next Geneva talks would be final about withdrawal and further assured of it the peace conference at Washington in 1987 and said that during the withdrawal period, Soviets would not engage in combat. Washington demanded to de-link the question of withdrawal from internal settlement of Afghanistan and Gorbachev acceded. Reagan and Gorbachev held a meeting in December 1987 to settle the controversial issues but Reagan turned the Geneva end game into an American political issue. He refused to attach supply of aid to Mujahideen with withdrawal, as he did not want to ""leave them prey to Kabul regime"" . This situation was created as the result of a misunderstanding of the US commitment to Cordovez in December 1985, when the UN and the Soviet Union both mistook meaning of guarantee as halt of aid to Mujahideen when the withdrawal would start. The official of the National Security Council who approved this decision had died soon after and Reagan did not bother to see details and contents of the accord. So, he refused to accept the draft of 1985, regarding the halt of aid . Washington had more bargaining leverage in the newly revealed position. It forced the Soviet Union to accept American demand that resistance and Kabul regime would receive symmetry of treatment: aid to Mujahideen would not stop unless aid to Kabul regime ended. It also made Soviets to drop linkage between withdrawal timetable and of coalition government. Gorbachev was prepared to accept Washington's demand, as his intention was evident from his dialogue with Cordovez when he said that Russians were very upset with their Afghans friends who would not let them to pullout the troops but Soviets would not take care of them. When the Soviet threat declined, the divergence of interests reduced the leverage of Pakistan on the United States and Washington ignored Islamabad's demand of an interim government of Mujahideen. Zia suspected that superpowers had made deal behind his back . The US gave Moscow at the bargaining table, which it had failed to achieve on the battlefield. The main interest of the US was the withdrawal of Soviet troops and it had no direct interest in the region. So, it did not bother about the post-war consequences. Washington welcomed the announcement of Gorbachev of February 15, 1988 regarding withdrawal, which was to begin from May 15, 1988 and last for ten months. Washington's desire for short timetable and a ""certain date"" for withdrawal were also fulfilled. At last both superpowers were ready to sign the final round of Geneva Accords and talks began on March 2, 1988 but proceeded slowly. The Soviet Union agreed to withdraw within nine months. The formation of interim government was not discussed. Cordovez promised by a vague statement to provide his good office to form a broad-based Afghan government . Both superpowers agreed to accept ""positive symmetry"": if Soviets would continue arming Kabul, the US would also continue aid to Mujahideen. Washington wanted more from Moscow without giving any thing in return. Moscow accepted proposals of Washington about timeframe of withdrawal and aid to Kabul regime. The United States accepted the role of guarantor on its own terms and conditions. The Soviets were infuriated at American's supremacy but Gorbachev was determined to withdraw and even he did not insist on a cease-fire as a condition for withdrawal, but he declared that his troops had right to retaliate if attacks were made during the process of withdrawal. The US policy towards the Third World has always been serving its own interests with a touch of domination. Reagan asked Zia-ul-Haq that ""how Pakistani leaders would handle their commitment to violated the agreement"" . His question was due to previous role of Pakistan in which it had been serving as a conduit for supply of America aid to Mujahideen. Zia replied that they would just lie about it, as they had been denying their activities since eight years. According to Shultz, Zia told Reagan that Muslims have the right to lie in a good cause . After setting all the issues, the Geneva Accords were signed on April 14, 1988 by the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and the Secretary of State of the US. Pakistan and the United States declared on this occasion that their signatures would not imply recognition to the Kabul regime. The US said that ""the obligations undertaken by guarantors are symmetrical"" and it had the right to provide military aid to the Mujahideen . The accords forbade both Afghanistan and Pakistan from intervening and interfering in the internal affairs. Boundary issue would be solved by a neutral phrase: ""both states should refrain from the threat or use of force so as not to violate the boundaries of each other"" . As guarantors, both superpowers agreed to refrain from any form of interference and intervention. An official role was given to the UN for return of refugees. Under these accords, first time the Soviet Union withdrew from a 'fraternal' state. A Soviet Journal blamed that decision of a few politburo members headed by Brezhnev had humiliated the Soviets . The United State took revenge of Vietnam and Soviets lost a huge number of lives and weapons like Americans in Vietnam they got nothing from Afghanistan except disgrace in the country and world. The US interest in the post-war reconstruction of Afghanistan was limited to expression of its concern for the establishment and support of a stable government. The main aim of the US was to weaken the Soviet Union. So, it supported the resistance through Pakistan and funneled aid to the Mujahideen. Pakistan saw the possibility of achieving some 'strategic depth' by implementing a friendly Islamic regime. Both Washington and Islamabad thought that Gorbachev had withdrawn his troops due to fear of military defeat. After withdrawal, the involvement of the US began to evaporate. The country, which has become a reference for the victory over Communism, suffered a lot after the departure of Red Army. Afghanistan caught up in the post-war fighting among various factions who had been struggling against the expansion of Communist rule with covert and overt support of the US and other countries. These groups turned against each other in the absence of a common threat. These factions did not agree on a durable power-sharing arrangement. Their lust for power brought further destruction and sufferings to the Afghans and caused great instability to this war-ravaged country. All the Afghans suffered adversely in this struggle to recover freedom. A large portion of population was deprived of their lives and limbs by all kinds of mines, booby traps and other deadly contraptions. These explosive devices were scattered in the area to reduce the mobility of foot soldiers of both sides. But the main victims were the helpless civilians and innocent children. Nearly a million were perished and some six million Afghans had to take refuge in other countries. Its entire infrastructure suffered a dreadful damage. The end of the Cold War and inability of the Mujahideen to form their government in Afghanistan changed the situation for American policy makers, who began to pursue a cooperative relationship with the Soviets. Both super- powers tried to seek resolution of regional conflicts. Policies of Gorbachev reduced the east-west rivalry, which relaxed tension between hard-liner Soviets and Americans. Gorbachev abandoned the policy of military confrontation with the US in order to restructure of Soviet economy, which led to the signing of Geneva Accords in April 1988. From April 1992 to 1994, more then twenty thousand lives were lost due to fratricidal struggle of the Afghans. The US stressed the UN to bring peace in Afghanistan, but it refused to play the role of a mediator. The US was of the view that fighting in Afghanistan could not end until there was external involvement by the neighboring states. America, itself was the biggest supplier of arms and funds in fueling the proxy war in the unfortunate land now began to criticize the interference and involvement of external world in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Disappearance of the USSR from the globe enabled the US to disengage from the area, which had no longer strategic value for it. Cooperation between superpowers on Afghanistan became a far cry. Its cries were just to keep it away from the Afghan quagmire in the absence of its own interests. But the emergence of the new force, the Taliban revived the US interest in Afghanistan once again. Washington wanted political stability in Afghanistan, so it made efforts for peace and tried to end conflict through a solution that could be suitable for all the factions. The US government also saw the Taliban as a source of stability in Central Asia that would enable the construction of an oil pipeline across Central Asia. This project was dropped only when the Taliban refused to accept the US conditions, this energy security changed into military one. The US alleged Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi exile and hero of Afghan Jihad for bombing the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998 killing 224 people and wounding 4500. The US alleged the Taliban for harboring the terrorists and installing their camps in Afghanistan and claimed to have strong evidence against Osama bin Laden and his organization, Al-Qaeda for involvement in embassies bombing. In retaliation, the US launched the cruise missile on alleged bin Laden's camps in eastern Afghanistan. The US government demanded that the Taliban should hand over bin Laden, when they refused, the US made the UN to impose the economic sanctions against the Taliban. They were also warned against human rights violation and promotion of drug trafficking. The Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 During all these years the US increased its pressure on the Taliban by reiterating its demand for handing over bin Laden or facing the consequences. Imposition of sanctions was part of this strategy. The US targeted the Taliban on different occasion and tried to replace them by using different cards, the ethnic, the former king, the southern alliance and the ultimate burnt came in the form of a military attack on Afghanistan as the US hold the Taliban responsible for terrorist attacks. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on NewYork and Washington drastically changed the whole scenario and the US once again reviewed its policy towards Afghanistan and launched a war against terrorism. These attacks caused 3000 causalities and numerous missing. To retaliate it, the US led international coalition, an anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan. Rapid and drastic changes occurred as the US was fully aware about the poor capacity of the Taliban, so it achieved its goal of toppling the Taliban regain and destruction of their apparent political and military might without wasting any time. The US began its military operation in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001 after the failure of the political and diplomatic efforts for solving the US Taliban stand off over the question of handing over bin Laden to the US government. After dismantling the Taliban regime, the US did not abandon its search operation in Afghanistan, as it wanted to kill or capture Osama bin Laden and destroy the Al-Qaeda network, which is still going on in one or other form. As far as the objective of the US-led coalition in Afghanistan is concerned, the US has achieved its goal to some extent. It has destroyed some known Al-Qaeda bases and network in Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban regime. What is the degree of the US achievement in this war cannot yet be determined but the US has vowed to fight terrorism in any part of the world. According to the US, Al-Qaeda network is not confined to a single state and terrorism is multifaceted phenomenon. In other words, being the superpower, the US can strike any country, group and individual, anywhere in the world for so-called terrorist activities. It is generally viewed that the US moves for the strengthening its relations with Afghanistan are for expanding its influence beyond the Afghan frontiers into Central Asia, and vis-à-vis China. However, whatever the goals of the US in the region, it is difficult to predict anything. Events are in a rapid transformed and all the major actors in the region are weighing their respective courses of action. The Afghan government cannot restore peace and security without the strong support of America and international community. There is no strong military and police system at its disposal, so the US should provide funds to the UN programs of rehabilitation for Afghanistan. This demand seems justified in the light of the US previous role in Afghanistan when it turned its back after the Soviet withdrawal. This time the US has realized its mistake and is on the path of helping Afghanistan and has fulfilled its commitment by providing financial support for rebuilding of this devastated country. One report indicates that the US has to spend about one and half billion dollars on the asymmetrical war and the US should spend many times more on developing the new infrastructure to win over the majority of Afghan people. The US assistance would enable the people to form a new social sector to operate for providing the relief to war-torn country. It is expected that long-suffering neighbours may be the beneficiaries of this reconstruction of the country and the US would not play the second Great Game, whose actors are already supporting its policies. This war against terrorism has also determined a new line of policy for links among the nations, which are now determined by the common interest of security and economic demands. The new political set up in Afghanistan cannot be made successful if the US-led coalition and other regional as well as local powers avoid to work for a 'single ethnic' group which brings nothing except anarchy and violence. In the past, Washington policy had no consistent approach towards Afghanistan and was often based on adhocism, determined by short time interests rather than principle. Conclusion The United States as super power has tended to have multiple goals in a single engagement, such goals often being contradictory to each other. A prime example of such situation is the US policy towards the Taliban in Afghanistan. Before this, Afghan policy was of getting the Soviet Union out during the 1980, the US had flooded the region with mass of weapons. The arm culture led to the emergence of a large number of warring factions who failed the international efforts to bring peace to the region. Apparently, there is peace but the western strategists need to ask either the new regime is capable of managing the country. The future of peace and security in the region is obscure because the vacuum left by the Taliban is being filled by megalomaniac warlords, local bandits, drug barons and opportunistic crooks. Moreover, ""Bush Doctrine"" has not offered any solution for this situation as it was only for war against terrorism. American government and opinion makers are denouncing terrorism everywhere ignoring the civilian deaths and rehabilitation of the Afghans. The horrible combination of annihilating air attack and the push on the ground destroyed the military power of the Taliban, as they were not equipped with modern weapons and there was not a single state or group ready to favour them except Osama and his organization Al Qaeda. While on the other side the US and its allies were determined to continue the bombing till the elimination of the Taliban. For Americans, the campaign could not be considered successful till the two men are captured or killed, particularly Osama Bin Laden. Speculations are made about their presence that had left the US and its allies embroiled on two fronts manhunt, one for Mullah Omar and other for his guest, Osama. Mullah Omar welcomed Osama because he had plied his host with money, gifts and other favours and ignored his role for using Afghanistan as a kind of organized breeding ground for militants. It is believed that as many as 70,000 Muslims from dozens of countries have passed through Afghan camps. Hundreds of militants are at large, who were involved in international terrorist operations. They can raise their money by themselves even if Al Qaeda's funds are blocked. American investigators have failed to track down key middlemen responsible for backing and funding. No doubt, Washington wasted no time in thinking and zeroing the Taliban. This action was also successful in terms of threatening and alarming the states that were providing shelter to these so-called terrorists. Terrorism is a phenomenon, which is not confined in the boundaries of any particular state or country. By killing a few guys at a time, do not end those who are still at work. Terrorists have no country or permanent settlement. They launch their activities from country to country just like the multi-nationals. Million of dollars are not sufficient to eradicate this phenomenon. But it can be checked to some extent by providing civil liberties to ethnic and religious minorities of the world. Huge amounts of money should divert from defense industry to human welfare. What has been given to world by this war against terrorism? Bush and Bin Laden, engaged in terrifying and killing the innocent civilians. Death toll in Afghanistan has already exceeded than that of the World Trade Center in New York."

Ukrainian plastics production failed to show any recovery in output in the first three quarters of 2009. Sales by the chemicals and petrochemicals industries in the period totalled UAH29bn, including UAH21bn of chemicals and UAH8bn of rubber and plastics products. In the January-September period, output totalled 222,000 tonnes. In September, monthly plastic production was 30,100 tonnes, 2,700 tonnes up on August, the highest monthly rate in the whole of 2009, but still well down on typical output levels. Over the period, overall chemicals and petrochemical production was down 30% year-on-year , although the rate of decline was easing. The figures are not surprising given that Ukraine is one of the worlds worst-hit countries in the global economic crisis and mirrored the 28% y-o-y decline seen throughout the industrial sector. Key petrochemicals consuming industries reported significant declines. Construction was the hardest hit sector, falling around a half. Even the fertiliser segment, which is traditionally more stable than other major petrochemical consumers such as the automotive and construction industries, reported massive decline in production volumes despite modest growth in agriculture. As Ukraine is unlikely to return to the 7%+ levels seen before the recession, it could take two or three years for the Ukrainian petrochemicals market to return to pre-recession levels. At the same time, the outlook for petrochemicals exports is bleak with the Russian, Turkish and EU markets also set to see sharp declines in demand in the short-term. The depreciation of the hryvnia may provide some slight relief in terms of competitiveness, but equally it raises the cost of feedstock that has to be passed on to the consumer or absorbed by a financially precarious petrochemicals industry. If the demand does not exist, then depreciation is unlikely to make a significant difference. Added to that is the strongly pro-cyclical trend evident in the petrochemicals sector, with peaks being higher than average industrial output and troughs a lot lower. As industrial output plunges, petrochemicals production will fall at a faster rate. As a result, new capacity plans such as the PVC plant in Kalush are likely to be halted or abandoned altogether as credit availability dries up and demand collapses both at home and among Ukraines main trading partners. Lukoil-Neftekhim began construction of a US$250mn PVC plant at Kalush in Q108, whose output will include 300,000tpa of PVC, in addition to a US$600mn chlorine and sodium hydroxide plant. BMI doubts that construction will be completed until 2010 or later owing to the depth and length of Ukraines economic recession. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Executive Summary Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 The threat to gas supplies from Russia is a significant downside risk to Ukrainian petrochemicals as it denies the industry access to ethane feedstock. The government has, in the past, found it difficult to find the money to finance its debt to Russias Gazprom. We caution that given the firm's financial difficulties, a potential disruption to gas supplies in 2010 when Ukraine begins to pay full market price for its imports. In terms of naphtha feedstock potential, there is no immediate need for an increase in nameplate oil refining capacity as it is already surplus to domestic requirements at 1mn b/d, which makes it unlikely that Ukraine will secure more domestic naphtha supply in the near future. Any level of uncertainty concerning feedstock will have negative consequences for the petrochemicals sector, with a shortage of feedstock for its cracker units. BMI believes that gas price hikes will lead to a downturn in ethylene output, with exports projected to decline to zero over the forecast period. Ethylene output could be in the range of 200,000-250,000tpa over the next five years. Cuts in ethylene output will increase dependency on PE imports, with the domestic industry without a ready availability of feedstock. Ukraine is also set to become more dependent on PP imports.

Source: BMI BMI estimates that total global ethylene capacity amounted to around 132mn tpa in 2008, with Asia Pacific representing 32% of installed capacity and North America 25%. Although the Middle East and Africa arethe largest source of oil and gas, theregion contributed just 17% of totalcapacity. This is set to change over themedium to long term as new capacitycomes online, with global capacity set toreach 174mn tpa in 2014. The regions contribution to global capacity is forecast to rise from 11% in Ethylene Capacities By Region 2009 Estimate Asia-Pacific Western Europe Eastern Europe 5% Middle East and Africa China South America NAFTA 26% Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 2007 to 23% by 2014. This would be an increase of nearly one-third over 2009 levels, but is a downward revision of around 7mn tpa from our previous estimates, reflecting the impact of the recession and the financial crisis on some projects, particularly in Asia. Gulf countries are expected to account for around 20% of the worlds ethylene production by 2010 compared to the current 8%. Some 50% of all new ethylene projects being developed in the world are located in the region. Saudi Arabia represents around 63% of total investment in the region, while Qatar comes second, with a 14% share. The Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association has forecast that the region will account for 40% of total global petrochemical production within 10 years, but has also warned that this would bring fresh challenges to the regions producers in terms of the need to secure more feedstock. The upside of the economic slowdown isthe halt and in some cases decline in thecost of petrochemicals plant construction,which had accelerated rapidly from 2002to 2008 amid a construction boom in theGulf region. A scarcity of raw materials,labour and engineering expertise hasplagued the Gulf petrochemicalsindustry, leading to project scheduleslippages. Some olefins complexes haveseen costs increasing by nearly four-foldfrom 2002. A downturn in constructionhas freed up resources and given thepetrochemical industry more negotiating leverage over costs of planned projects. On the downside, there is a danger in over-reliance on Asian markets, where growth is moderating as they expand their own domestic petrochemicals capacities, contributing to the risk of global over-capacity. The greatest uncertainties come from China, which is massively expanding capacity in 2010-2012, potentially leading to a decline in cracker operating rates to 80-85%, which is widely regarded as the break-even point for most petrochemicals producers. Gulf producers will be hoping that capacities in Europe and North America are crowded out of the market in order to provide further export opportunities. China should see its share of the global total rise by 2percentage points , but the rest of the Asia Pacific region will only see a 0pp increase. Another region set to raise its global profile is South America, with significant new capacity set to come online in Brazil and Venezuela. Brazilian petrochemicals giant Braskem is seeking to dominate production in the region and become a serious player on the international petrochemicals market. The company is ramping up capacity, including a world-scale ethylene joint venture with Pequiven in Venezuela. South Americas share of the global Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Ethylene Capacities By Region 2014 Forecast Asia- Pacific (excl. China) Western Europe Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa China South America 5% NAFTA 19% Source: BMI Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 total should rise from 3% to 5% due to an increase in capacity totalling 4mn tpa. However, the economic downturn led to a revision of investment programmes in South America with the JV to be delayed by two years to 2013-2014. Dow Chemical and Petrobras have also moved back their planned petrochemical projects by one year, to 2012 and 2013, respectively. Feedstock Issues With Saudi Arabia, and Qatar in particular, ramping up capacities with a number of world-scale projects, the feedstock will also shift. At present, naphtha represents 54% of feedstock for the worlds crackers, with ethane providing a further 28%. BMI forecasts that by 2014 ethane will represent around 45% of total feedstock, derived largely from the gas fields in the Arabian Gulf. Access to cheap feedstocks gives petrochemicals companies in the Arabian Peninsula and Iran an even greater cost advantage over producers elsewhere in the world, particularly in Europe and North America. Higher oil prices have led governments in the region to reinvest profits in constructing petrochemicals plants. By 2014 the Middle East and Africa will have more than twice the capacity of Western Europe. Saudi Arabia accounts for almost half the US$250bn committed to petrochemicals projects in the Middle East, excluding Iran. Due to this strong growth in capacity in the Gulf region, investors will be reluctant to expand capacity in North America and Western Europe. Even de-bottlenecking expansions could be abandoned due to concerns about feedstock costs and loss of competitiveness. An increased use of ethane and expansion of capacity should help raise margins. Ethane costs just over a third of the cost of naphtha and cracking margins are 6% higher. Naphtha prices have risen in line with crude, which was reaching all-time highs by mid-2008. This caused ethylene contract prices to soar to over USc70 per pound in July 2008, a 47% y-o-y increase. Average oil prices of US$60 per barrel or above make the Middle East the prime destination for investment, due to access to low-cost ethane. However, the sharp decline in oil prices towards the end of 2008 and into 2009 should give naphtha-fed crackers a boost in competitiveness. Impact Of The Global Slowdown The global slowdown is a cause for concern for the petrochemicals industry, which is carrying out large-scale capacity additions in 2009 and 2010, leading to a supply glut. Middle Eastern producers will be particularly affected as they are heavily reliant on exports, particularly to Asia. Saudi Arabian projects are already being delayed due to a lack of buyers for their products as well as the global financial crunch, although this is expected to be a short-term phenomenon. In the long term, with Middle Eastern capacity growth rising faster than Chinese import growth, producers are likely to reduce operating rates. In 2008, significant parts of Chinas polyolefins market were stagnating, and the situation was set to deteriorate further over 2009, putting pressure on olefins prices. Chinese ethylene self-sufficiency could top 60% by 2010, compared to 45% in 2006. The falling price of naphtha feedstock will also undermine the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 competitive advantage ethane-fed crackers in the Middle East rely on to penetrate new markets. The downturn is not likely to last beyond 2010, as Chinese demand is likely to accelerate, with a supply gap exceeding 15bn tpa by 2020. Meanwhile, Chinese crackers are expected to struggle to find competitively priced sources of naphtha, bolstering the penetration of Middle Eastern producers in Asian markets. Global olefins demand fell in 2008 due to the impact of the financial crisis from September of that year on consumer confidence. The situation was exacerbated by destocking throughout all petrochemicals product chains. Olefins demand fell by 3-4% in 2008 and growth in 2009 was largely flat. While a recovery is forecast from 2010, substantial new capacity is due to come onstream in the Middle East, taking advantage of low feedstock costs, and Asia. This is likely to keep crackers in the developed economies running at around break-even or even a loss. BMI estimates that in these markets cracker need to operate at 80-85% in order to break even. As a result, there is a distinct likelihood of ethylene capacity closures in the US and Europe over coming years with smaller units most likely to get axed. Table: World Petrochemicals Capacities, 2009 Product Capacity Ethylene 132,020 Propylene 79,870 Butadiene 12,620 High-density polyethylene 26,740 Low-density polyethylene 21,055 Linear low-density polyethylene 32,055 Polyethylene terephthalate 20,345 Polypropylene 52,320 Polyvinyl chloride 42,240 Polystyrene 12,000 Methanol 66,350 Ammonia 145,180 Urea 133,000 Source: BMI Cracker utilisation rates will be determined by demand for downstream producers. Around 60-65% of ethylene is used in the production of polyethylene , which is used in the production of film, packaging, household goods, containers, bags and pipes. A further 20-25% is used in the production of Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 ethylene oxide , most of which is used to make ethylene glycol , the feedstock for polyethylene terephthalate or polyester as well as anti-freeze. The chlorination of ethylene produces ethylene dichloride , which is used to produce vinyl chloride monomer , the feedstock for polyvinyl chloride , a polymer that is widely used in construction. Ethylbenzene , the feedstock for styrene monomer which produces polystyrene , acylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and styrene butadiene rubber is manufactured by reacting ethylene with benzene. Global PE demand has been reasonably strong and growing ahead of GDP in most countries, including the US. The construction of new crackers in the Middle East is being accompanied by new export-oriented PE plants in the region, which benefit from access to competitively priced feedstock. High growth Asian markets such as China are also set to witness a rise in capacity along the product chain, helping them become more self-sufficient, competitive and bolstering growth in exports across the product chain. As substantial amounts of new capacity are coming onstream in emerging markets at a time of poor demand, PE producers in developed markets will be under pressure to reduce prices and less competitive plants are likely to close. Polyethylene Performance has varied across PE products, with linear low-density polyethylene steadily eroding low density polyethylene market share as it allows lower gauges that can reduce costs for many applications while retaining tensile strength. The global market for LDPE is in a state of existential decline with the global recession simply hastening the trend and closure of plants in developed markets are inevitable as LLDPE plants replace them in the emerging markets. Meanwhile, HDPE has continued to exhibit strong growth, albeit at a slower rate than LLDPE. By 2009, LLDPE accounted for 40% of global PE capacity, followed by HDPE and LDPE . However, the PE market was hit hard by the financial crisis and its resulting impact on the economy. Polymer prices have plummeted as demand has diminished, purchasers withdrew from the market and producers destocked throughout the value chain. Consequently, just as demand growth had exceeded GDP growth during the good times, the decline was sharper than the contraction in overall demand, falling by as much as 20% in 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Polyvinyl Chloride Up to 75% of PVC consumption istypically used in the constructionindustry, which means the PVC industryis heavily influenced by broadereconomic trends. The collapse in thehousing market in many developedmarkets as well as a rapid slowdown inconstruction in China and the MiddleEast from H208 has therefore dealt asevere blow to PVC producers with BMIexpecting the closure of smaller plantsand consolidation due to a sustainedslump in the market. On top of highchlorine prices and in the face of a rapid growth in Chinese output, BMI warns that many PVC plants will operate at below capacity in the medium term, and at a loss due to global over-capacity. Polystyrene In the PS segment, the rising price of benzene in line with rising oil prices has raised the cost of production, while rising capacity has put pressure on PS prices. Global PS demand totalled 10mn tones in 2008, while capacity was just under 12mn tpa, with over-capacity around 10%. The situation has worsened as a result of the financial crisis and economic recession, despite an easing of oil prices since mid-2008. Up to 3mn tpa of PS capacity could come onstream in the next five years with most capacity due to come onstream in China. Due to rising prices, PS faces increasing competition with PP, although at the same time it has gained market share from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene . The main growth market is in building insulation. In developed markets, PS capacity has been steadily cut over the past decade and there are few plans for new capacity over the medium-term. If oil prices fall to low levels, naphtha cracking rates could increase, thereby increasing benzene availability pushing down costs. Polyethylene Terephthalate PET is manufactured through the esterification reaction between purified terephthalic acid and monoethylene glycol which create a basic ester that is polymerized, extruded, cut into chips and then processed to form the PET resin. Nearly all PTA output and around half of MEG is devoted to PET production. As such, the performance of the PET market directly affects PTA production. More than 60% of PET is used for the production of synthetic fibres, known commonly as polyester, with most of the rest is used for bottle production. As a fibre, PET is used in clothing, tyre manufacturing and textiles. As a Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Global PE Capacities By Product 2009 Estimate HDPE LLDPE 41% Source: BMI LDPE Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 light-weight, strong and clear plastic, PET bottle resin has grown in importance. PET film is used in electronics and packaging. Global demand growth is being led by China, which is ramping up capacities in order to remain self-sufficient. BMI estimated the global PET market at around 30mn tonnes in 2008 and could reach up to 40mn tonnes by 2015, by which time the Chinese market could represent two-thirds of global polyester consumption, compared to around half in 2005. According to BMIs projections, global PET production capacity is set to rise from 20mn tpa in 2008 to 30mn tpa by 2015, mostly in China, an increase of more than 50%. However, we also project that demand will rise by only one-third over the same period, leading to a threat of over-capacity in a market that is already close to saturation. The growth in Asian capacity is a particular concern, with low-cost Chinese producers likely to sell their excess production on the global market, thereby depressing prices. Polypropylene BMI estimates that global PP capacity totalled 53mn tpa in 2009, with the US as the worlds largest PP producer, with 17% of capacity, followed by China with 13%. Western European producing markets contributed 19%, while the Middle East despite its immense resources represented just 8%. BMI research indicates that the global landscape is set to radically shift over the next five years as demand and supply shift eastwards due to growth in developed markets. Global demand for PP has been running on average at 7% over the past decade, well above global average economic growth. BMI estimates global PP demand at 48mn tonnes in 2008, while global PP capacity was around 52mn tpa, giving a total capacity utilisation rate of 92%. As with all petrochemicals commodities, the level of growth in China and India has been largely responsible for the pace of PP demand growth. However, rising PP prices mean they are catching up with PE prices, leading to a slackening in demand growth momentum. Nevertheless, PP consumption is set to exceed 50mn tonnes in 2010 and could reach 80mn tonnes by 2016, making it the worlds largest polyolefins market. China is now the worlds largest PP consumer, with BMI projecting that demand will reach 11mn tonnes in 2010, one-third more than in 2006. This is likely to lead to a deficit of over 1mn tonnes. Most new capacity will come onstream in 2009-2012, causing a temporary decline in capacity utilisation to no less than 85%. In 2008 alone BMI estimates the amount of added capacity at over 4mn tpa, with a further 5mn tpa in 2009-2010. According to BMI forecasts, China will contribute 24% of the 14mn tpa of PP capacity that is due to come online worldwide between 2008 and 2013. The whole of Asia will represent just under half the additional capacity, while the Middle East will add a further 25%, largely due to the developments in Saudi Arabia. China is to become the worlds biggest PP producing country. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Capacity expansion is occurring during a period of economic downturn, leading to excess capacity. We expect PP producers in the Middle East and Asia to firm up their positions on the global market, exporting their surpluses to the detriment of Western European and North American producers, which are unlikely to bring significant new capacity online over the coming years. BMI analysis indicates that profitability in Western Europe and North America will come under attack from cheap imports and these regions will struggle to maintain their competitiveness on export markets. BMI forecasts a net decline in PP capacity in these areas, with producers mothballing or closing older, smaller and less efficient plants of capacities under 200,000tpa and focusing their attention on increasing capacity at larger sites. Production is shifting east, following the pattern of demand. BMI expects modest declines in US capacity over the next five years. US producers are set to devote an increasing proportion of output to the domestic market as exports come under pressure from new capacity in the Middle East and Asia. Net US exports are likely to fall to zero by 2012. The main challenge for the US is over-reliance on propylene derived from fluid catalytic cracker units in refineries. As refinery capacity is unlikely to keep up with the growing demand for propylene feedstock, PP producers are expected to be forced to look to other sources to sustain output. BMI forecasts that US demand will reach around 9mn tpa in 2009, an 18% rise over 2005 levels, leaving a net surplus of around 1mn tpa for export. In Western Europe BMI estimates show that the recovery in PP demand slowed considerably from 2005 to 2008 as the regions economy slowed. Demand growth is set to be stronger in Central and Eastern European markets over the next five years, although outside Russia no significant extra PP capacity is set to come online. This trend could lead to the EU becoming a net PP importer over the next five years. Producers are already closing PP plants and are focusing attention on removing bottlenecks and expanding their other facilities. The stagnation in production in Europe and North America and slower demand growth rates are in stark contrast to the surging Chinese market, which we predict to be increasingly self-sufficient. China is the worlds largest PP consumer, and BMI projects that demand will reach 11mn tonnes in 2010, one-third more than in 2006. This is likely to lead to a deficit of over 1mn tonnes. However, the addition of 4mn tpa of PP capacity in 2008-2011, with other projects in the pipeline, should help contain growth in imports. BMI forecasts that China will represent 23% of the 14mn tpa of PP capacity due to come online worldwide between 2008 and 2012. The whole of Asia will represent just under half the additional capacity, while the Middle East will add a further 23%, largely due to developments in Saudi Arabia. There are no plans for additional capacity in the US, giving China the opportunity to become the worlds biggest PP producing country. Most of the contribution to capacity expansion in the Americas will be in Brazil, with 2mn tpa due to be added over the next five years. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 PP projects have faced delays in the Middle East. The opening of PetroRabighs 700,000tpa PP plant in Saudi Arabia was moved from Q408 to Q109, while the Sharq and Yansab complexes, which have a large amount of associated PP capacity, were also moved to 2009. Other PP plants due to come online in the country in 2009 included a 250,000tpa expansion of Saudi Polyolefins plant at Al-Jubail. Also at Al-Jubail, the Al-Waha Petrochemical JV between LyondellBasell and Sahara Olefins is due to add an extra 460,000tpa of PP. PP producers face significant risks. A stronger than expected slowdown in Chinese growth could lead to a glut in supply, driving prices down and forcing less competitive operations out of business. Margins would also be put under pressure by sustained high oil prices, which would keep the price of propylene at high levels. A combination of over-capacity and rising costs of raw materials could lead to the reduction of PP capacity in developed markets. A significant constraint facing the industry is the tightening of the propylene market as production of the monomer outstrips refinery output. Cuts in refinery throughput during the course of the global economic downturn will make this constraint more evident. As a result, some PP producers are considering plans to build plants dedicated to propylene production. While feedstock prices are set to rise, Chinese and Middle Eastern producers are managing to bring down prices of end products, leading to pressures on margins, particularly for producers in the developed world. The only way producers from the regions will be able stay afloat is to corner niche markets with innovative products, requiring greater technical sophistication than currently offered by plants in emerging markets. Efficiency in the manufacturing process also needs to be improved and markets developed. At the same time, energy and transportation prices are high, although will ease with the decline in oil prices. Tanks Still Brimming Global product markets lost more ground in September, thanks to continuing distillate stock building and the narrowing of the gasoline crack spread. Refiners were again obliged to trim operating levels as margins contracted. Margins for West Texas Intermediate crude at the US Gulf Coast halved in September. European refinery performance improved as a result of precautionary run cuts. The Rotterdam Brent margin widened in September by almost 50% to US$3per barrel . Sadly, Singapore refinery profitability came under increased pressure and a continuation of Asia Pacifics margin weakness bodes ill for downstream investment. Casting a long shadow over the oil market is the excessive stock position, with refined product inventories in particular forming a barrier capable of blocking further price appreciation. Early October saw US stockpiles of distillate fuel, including heating oil and diesel, climb to their highest level since Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Global Oil Products Price Outlook Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 January 1983, according to US Energy Department data. Gasoline inventories also jumped to 214mn bbl as refiners boosted output. While there are indications that gasoline consumption trends have stabilised in the US, there is no evidence of such an improvement in distillate demand. US refiners such as Valero Energy and Sunoco have been cutting throughputs more aggressively than at any time since the early 1980s, even though a cold winter is being predicted. Temporary plant closures appear to be spreading, and maintenance activity either brought forward or extended. Refiners fear that even low temperatures will not provide a sufficiently large demand boost to drain overflowing storage tanks. The margin for producing heating oil and diesel may decline by more than one-third by January 2010, according to Energy Security Analysis. The Energy Department predicts that heating costs in winter 2009/10 will fall 8% across the US, even as the north east is faced with potentially frigid weather. February 2010 futures contracts in early October showed that the premium of heating oil to crude oil will average US$5-5/bbl in January 2010, down from the recent US$8/bbl. A year ago the future crack spread for heating oil was almost US$20/bbl. An El Nio weather system in the Pacific Ocean may push down temperatures in the US north east in Q110, predicted independent weather forecaster Commodity Weather Group in a late September 2009 report. Without an unusually cold US winter, distillate stocks are more than ample and could provide a constant drain on market strength. Having said that, US heating oil futures reached a seven-week high in early October on speculation that colder weather predicted for the rest of the month would boost demand for home-heating fuel. In early October the Energy Department predicted that US demand for distillate fuels could fall more than 8% in 2009, with a decline to just 3mn barrels per day , the biggest setback since 1980. There was enough heating oil and diesel in the US as of early October to last more than 50 days, with stocks up by one-quarter in the first nine months of 2009, or by almost 34mn bbl to around 172mn bbl. It will require a drop of more than 52mn bbl, or 30%, by the end of March to bring supplies down to the five- year average. Gasoil stockpiles in Europes Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area are also plentiful, amounting to almost 22mn bbl as of October 8, according to Netherlands-based consultant PJK International. The preceding four weeks had seen a welcome 4% decline from the previous record level. However, diesel and fuel oil demand remains extremely weak. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 The volume of refined products in floating storage, largely distillates, off north west Europe and the Mediterranean had grown to about 50mn bbl as of the end of September, up from the end-August level of around 40mn bbl, the International Energy Agency said in its October Oil Market Report . In spite of better economic conditions, the trends towards higher fuels taxation and the overhaul of subsidies in some developing countries mean that a sustainable recovery in demand is far from certain. In spite of evidence that US drivers may be migrating back to less fuel-efficient vehicles, the major shifts in patterns of consumption resulting from vehicle ownership changes are unlikely to be reversed simply because pump prices are temporarily lower. The move in Europe away from gasoline and towards diesel is expected to continue for a while longer, in spite of steep price differentials. However, advances in small petrol engine technology may mean these more economical units bring to an end the love affair with diesel. Over the longer term, expansion of the oil refining system is still needed, particularly as market growth is likely to accelerate as the world pulls clear of recession/depression. However, refining margins look set to remain under pressure. Coupled with weaker upstream economics and modest profits in fuels retailing, the downturn in refining profitability means that both international and national oil companies may reexamine investment plans. The downstream oils market needs to see continued high level spending in new crude distillation capacity, improved plant upgrading capability and better storage/distribution logistics. There will inevitably be reduced capital expenditure if industry earnings and cash flow remain under pressure. This can only result in the market tightening once again as demand picks up with a return to extreme price volatility and generally higher fuel prices. Revised Forecasts During Q309, BMI estimates that the global wholesale price for premium unleaded gasoline will have been US$76/bbl. This compares with US$69in the second quarter of 2009. During the three quarters to September the price has ranged from a monthly low of US$49in January 2009 to the June 2009 level of US$79/bbl. Gasoline prices in Q309 are down 40% from US$127Q308. For Q409 we now forecast an average global gasoline price of US$71/bbl, a decline of 7% from the previous quarter, but a y-o-y decline of almost 41% from the US$120/bbl seen a year earlier. For the whole of 2009, the BMI assumption for gasoline is an average US$67/bbl, with the price having peaked in June. The overall y-o-y fall in 2009 gasoline prices will be 33%.

Source: BMI Jet prices averaged US$74/bbl in Q309, using the composite for New York, Singapore and Rotterdam. The annual decrease was 48%, with jet exceeding the decline in gasoil prices. The monthly low during the previous six months was US$53in February 2009, with the price reaching US$77/bbl in June 2009. For Q409 we assume an average global jet price of US$75, a quarter-on-quarter rise of 0% and a y-o-y fall of 4%. For 2009 the annual level is forecast to be US$68/bbl. This compares with US$124/bbl in 2008. In Q309 gasoil averaged US$74/bbl, based on a composite global price. This is a y-o-y fall of 46% over Q308, illustrating a recession-induced relative weakening of diesel versus gasoline. Our revised Q409 forecast is for global gasoil at an average US$87, a q-o-q increase of 17%. The seasonal effect and likely rise in year-end crude prices are set to have limited impact on gasoil prices as a result of the unusually large inventory position. For 2009 as a whole, the BMI forecast is for an average price of US$70/bbl, assuming a monthly high of US$94/bbl in December. The full-year outturn is a 41% fall from the 2008 level.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 Table: Oil Product Prices, 2007-2014 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Petrochemical producers in the EU are coming under regulatory pressure, which they claim is putting them at a disadvantage to their Middle Eastern, Asian, and Russian rivals. However, BMI research finds that many of these claims are exaggerated and are unlikely to pose a significant problem to the competitiveness of European petrochemicals majors. In June 2007, the EUs REACH directive came into force, despite concerns from industry bodies about its implementation and possible adverse effects on competitiveness. REACH is the EUs new framework for registering and assessing chemicals, and directly affects manufacturers, importers and users of chemicals across a wide range of sectors. It rationalises the EU regulatory system for chemicals, replacing over 40 pieces of legislation. The aim of the programme is to identify and phase out the most hazardous chemicals, insisting on their substitution with safer alternatives wherever possible, as opposed to the old system which was based on establishing safe levels of chemical exposure. Each of the substances covered by REACH but not products themselves need to be registered with the new European Chemicals Agency based in Helsinki. The onus is on the producer to ensure that any imported substances are registered with the ECA in order to trade on the European market. REACH is being phased in by initially targeting the most hazardous substances. Registration is required for all substances supplied above 1tpa, which covers over 30,000 substances. REACH is intended to: Increase knowledge of the hazards of chemicals; Only allow chemicals onto the market if specific safety data on them are made available; Detect, limit and, when needed, replace hazardous substances with safer alternatives; Shift the burden of providing proof that chemicals are not dangerous from public authorities to chemical manufacturers; Ensure that there is adequate information on all chemicals and that this information is communicated to all who come into contact with the chemicals from users to final consumers . Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 European Overview Regulation Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 While REACH may help protect the EU from hazardous imports, petrochemicals producers based in the EU claim they are being put at a disadvantage in the fastest growing markets in Asia notably China at a time when producers in the Middle East, Russia and other emerging markets are ramping up capacity with far lighter regulatory structures. The Middle East is expected to overtake Europe by 2015, when it will account for about 20% of world ethylene capacity, against Europes 17%. At the same time, Chinas importance is increasing, with demand expected to keep rising by at least 9% per annum between 2007 and 2012, compared with around 2% for the US and the EU. However, the Chinese are also aiming to boost their capacity, making China a highly competitive market. As the Chinese increase their domestic capacity, Middle Eastern producers are likely to turn to Europe to dispose of future surplus capacity. Russia is also expected to start investing heavily in petrochemicals in the next few years. Table: Key Elements Of REACH Registration A manufacturer or importer is required to register any substance that they supply to the EU market in amounts of over 1tpa Evaluation The authorities carry out annual in-depth assessments of substances flagged as being of potential high risk Authorisation The uses of substances of very high concern, e.g. CMRs (carcinogens, mutagens and toxic to reproduction), PBTs and vPvBs (very persistent, very bioaccumulative) require authorisation Agency A new EU Chemicals Agency based in Helsinki administers REACH, in co-operation with member states competent authorities Source: DEFRA Supporters of REACH in the environmental lobby insist that the long-term direct costs are negligible compared with sales turnover and can be absorbed by the petrochemicals and chemicals industries. They point to a European Commission Extended Impact Assessment carried out in 2003 which estimated that the direct costs of REACH to the European chemicals industry would amount to a total EUR2bn over a period of 11 years representing 0% of the chemical industrys annual sales. While BMI agrees that large petrochemicals companies will be able to foot the bill for REACH, small and medium-sized enterprises will face significant adversity. In a report released before REACH was adopted in December 2006, the German industry group Verband der Chemischen Industrie said the regulation imposes a considerable burden on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, owing to the problems they could face if suppliers no longer produce a substance they require in the manufacturing process. It added: Small and medium-sized enterprises do not usually have the leverage to convince a supplier to register a product and document the specific use to which it is put. In many cases the only option remaining to a downstream user is to go through the protracted process of changing its formulation. The reformulation of large parts of their Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 product portfolio is therefore a crucial cost factor for downstream users. However, there are few SMEs in the petrochemicals sector that would be directly affected by REACH. Economies of scale in the petrochemicals industry require large-scale production, effectively preventing the emergence of a significant number of SME producers in the sector. Moreover, REACH includes special provisions to help SME low-tonnage suppliers, with greatly reduced information requirements for substances supplied between one and ten tonnes, and an 11-year registration period for these substances. SMEs also benefit from reduced fees. REACH also provides some benefits for SMEs, with most risk assessment for chemical substances undertaken by larger producers, which are required to share the data a requirement that has been resisted by majors. Consequently, the impact of REACH across the petrochemical sector will be inconsequential to the competitiveness of European companies. EU chemicals output, excludingpharmaceuticals, fell 22% y-o-y inJanuary 2009, according to the EuropeanChemical Industry Council , whoalso reported that business confidenceamong chemical industry managerscontinued to deteriorate in March 2009. However, price data showed thatchemical products remained stable inJanuary 2009, suggesting that output cutshad stabilised the market. Base chemicalsregistered the biggest drop in output inJanuary, while specialty chemicals andconsumer chemicals recorded a less significant decline. For 2008 as a whole, the EU chemicals industry experienced a 4% decline in output. Ethylene production in Western Europe was down 8% to 19mn tonnes. Petrochemical prices grew 7%, with polymers and specialty chemicals experiencing price changes of 2% and 3%, respectively. Output was well below forecasts of 2% growth made at the beginning of 2008. The 4% decline represented the first year of negative growth since 2003, and was related to the dramatic slowdown in EU economic activity and the sharp deceleration of world output and trade, according to Cefic. This was exacerbated by the financial crisis in H208, resulting in a stronger downturn in the construction and automotive sectors, which are among the top consumers of petrochemicals. Meanwhile, output in the US fell by 2%. BMI believes the decline will worsen if the EU economy goes into recession Cefics 2009 forecast is based on zero growth.

Some European producers such as Arkema, DSM, and Rhodia have announced production cutbacks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 26 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 In Ukraine, the chemicals and petrochemicals industry has traditionally been considered fundamental to the economy, owing to the role it plays in manufacturing intermediates. The government has begun to gradually implement financial reforms and privatisation legislation allowing foreign participation in the industry. A strategic plan for the chemicals industry up to 2010 has been developed. This includes expanding the output and range of fertiliser and plant protection agents, improving non-toxic packaging materials for the food-processing industry, expanding the range of chemicals for light industry and developing new chemical materials for the high-technology industries. However, much of the planning may have been seriously damaged by the recent decline in output and pressures on the industry. Eastern European companies have increased their sales activity in Ukraine in recent years. Czech-based Chemopetrol increased its sales volume by a factor of 20, while the Hungarian Tiszai Vegyi Kombint increased sales 100-fold. Over the same period, sales volumes of Russian producers declined in Ukraine. The chemicals industry in Ukraine comprises chemicals, petrochemicals and chemical-pharmaceutical sub-segments, with more than 1,600 enterprises and structural units. The chemicals sub-segment accounts for nearly 17% of the production, while the petrochemicals and chemical-pharmaceutical sub-segments account for the remainder. The petrochemicals industry manufactures a variety of products, including car and motorcycle tyres , hoses and consumer goods. Petrochemicals and rubber-asbestos enterprises are concentrated in the regions of Donbas, Prydniprovia, Prysivashia and Prykarpattya. The major centres include Kyiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Shostka, Sumy and Rubizhne. Considerable structural changes are underway in the chemicals and petrochemicals industry. State-owned enterprises constitute less than one-fifth of the total number of petrochemicals facilities, and account for about one-third of the products. KarpatNaftoKhim operates a petrochemicals plant including a 250,000tpa ethylene cracker at Kalush. The nations other cracker is situated at the Linos oil refinery, and has a production capacity of 300,000tpa. The countrys only PP plant is operated by TNK-BP. From January 1 2006, TNK-BP has been refining its oil in Ukraine at the Lisichansk oil refinery, which is owned and managed by CJSC LINIK. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Ukraine Market Overview Market Structure Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Oriana at Kalush in the Ivano-Frankivsk region is Ukraines largest petrochemicals enterprise. It has 10 independent plants and a number of auxiliary workshops and services, and produces more than 100 commodities, including olefins, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda and antistatic. It also operates a potassium fertiliser plant as well as ethylene, propylene and benzene units.

Ukraine is in last place in BMIs CEE Petrochemicals Business Environment matrix this quarter with 38points. Ukraines uncertain political environment coupled with rising gas import prices and the possibility of supply disruption are undermining the countrys potential for increased petrochemicals production capacity. The situation has deteriorated since last quarter, with a sharp downturn in the domestic economy, coupled with tightening credit conditions and a decline in key markets. The sector is dominated by Russian petrochemicals majors and remains tied into the old Soviet economic framework as a satellite of Russia. Diversification of feedstock and markets could ensure stable growth in the long term.

Ukraine scores 37points in this category, compared with a regional average of 46points. The petrochemical market rating measures our combined scores for current capacity in ethylene and polymer production as well as five-year growth projections for cracker capacities. Ukraine scores just 33points, owing to a reassessment of polymer production capacities. Ukraine has the lowest polymer capacity in the region, with just one PP plant with a capacity of 200,000tpa and a polyvinyl chloride facility with a nameplate capacity of 55,000tpa. The country has an ethylene production capacity of 550,000tpa, putting it slightly ahead of Romania. The score will improve if the Azot PE plant, with a capacity of 150,000tpa, is brought back into operation and with the development of new PVC production facilities. The country structure rating comprises BMIs scores for financial and physical infrastructure and trade bureaucracy. Ukraine scores a poor 44points, which is well behind the regional average of 59points. Ukraine has passed a number of legislative reforms that will underpin the development of the legal infrastructure necessary to support foreign investment, but reform is ongoing. The government has embarked on market liberalisation, cutting back on regulation and removing many licensing requirements. Most restrictions on foreign exchange transactions have also been removed. Foreign businesses dealing with the country cite confusing, ill-defined regulations as a major hindrance to trade. The changed political environment and a willingness to open up the countrys borders enough to permit entry to the WTO and acquire better trading terms with major blocs may now start to yield more rapid results. Risks To Realisation Of Returns This rating comprises the ratings for market and country risks, weighted towards market risks. The market risk rating measures the regulatory environment of the petrochemicals sector. Ukraine scores 40points, with its score under pressure in recent months owing to the sectors vulnerability to supply cuts from Russia, which was demonstrated in January 2009 when Gazprom cut gas supplies to Ukraine. Members of Ukraines main government security agency service, the Sluzhba Bezpeky Ukrayiny , raided the headquarters of Ukrainian state-run gas company Naftogaz on March 4, in an apparent attempt to acquire a copy of the original contract signed on January 19, between Naftogaz and Gazprom which ended the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. The raid appears to be the latest event in an increasingly bitter power struggle between Ukraines prime minister, Yulia Timoshenko, and president, Viktor Yushchenko, over the countrys energy industry. The dispute could have serious implications for the near-term flow of Russian gas to and through Ukraine. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Despite Ukraines large domestic market and strong economic potential, most foreign investors have to date been deterred by the poor business environment. President Viktor Yushchenkos victory in 2004 had obvious positive implications for improvements in the business environment. Reforms have been centred on WTO accession, which was approved in February 2008, with membership officially attained in May. On the upside, the petrochemicals sector is not encumbered by the environmental regulations imposed on neighbouring countries that have joined the EU. The Ukrainian petrochemicals sector is oriented to serving the Ukrainian and Russian economies, which means that it is largely unaffected by REACH. Nevertheless, Ukrainian production units are dependent on Russian suppliers and investors, making them vulnerable to Russias interests, which are often oriented towards its political objectives. The country risk rating covers the long-term economic, financial and political risks and the structure of the economy. Ukraine scores just 40points, owing to deterioration in the long-term financial and external risk scores, with foreign investors wary of the elevated international risk scenario. The overall business environment can be considered unattractive, largely owing to a high level of perceived political risk, only moderate progress in deregulation and competition, plus limited growth potential in oil and gas production. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Industry Trends And Developments The petrochemicals sector in Ukraine could face collapse owing to plummeting output and a sharp decline in domestic demand and export. The economic outlook for the country as a whole is dire. Output decline hasfollowed the trend of theeconomic cycle. In 2008,the chemical andpetrochemical indexsuggested that the volume of production fell by 3% over the year. The decline was more marked in H208, with output in this sector declining by nearly 40% in December 2008, according to BMI estimates. However, Ukraines largest petrochemicals producer, KarpatNaftoKhim, had announced as early as February 2008 that it was considering suspending operations owing to a drop in demand for ethylene in Europe, and reportedly paused operations at its major facilities in July. All petrochemicals segments were affected by the sharp downturn, with producers idling capacity in sectors such as PVC by the end of the year and delaying construction plans. Then, in January 2009, chemicals and petrochemicals production shrank by close to 50%, as the sector effectively ground to a halt during the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, which saw gas supplies to Ukraine cut off for nearly three weeks. This was in contrast to 2006 and 2007, when chemicals and petrochemicals industrial growth was 3% and 6%, respectively, and contrary to projections from within the sector. At the same time, the fertiliser sector has suffered owing to earlier gas supply cuts from Russia. In October 2009, the Ukrainian government cancelled a winning UAH5bn bid for the Odessa Port Plant. The government, which set a minimum price of UAH4bn , claimed that bidders had plotted to bring the purchase price down. Ukraines Nortima was the declared winner of the auction before the government invalidated the bid. The company beat Ukraines Frunze-Flora and Russian Sibur subsidiary Azot Seris. OPP owns and operates two ammonia and two urea plants at Odessas Yuzhnyi Port with combined capacity for 1mn tpa ammonia and 900,000tpa urea. It also owns an export terminal for ammonia and urea that ships products made by other plants in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian Petrochemical And Chemical Production Indices, 2000-2008 Index, percent oftheprevious year Industry Chemical and Petrochemical Source: Ukraine State Statistics Committee Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 In July 2009, TNK-BP announced it had increased to almost 100% its effective stake in its main Ukrainian asset, the Lysychansk oil refinery. It is intent on modernising and expanding Ukrainian refining capacities with a view selling high-quality car fuel. In March 2008, KarpatNaftoKhim, part of Russias Lukoil Group chemicals division Lukoil-Neftekhim, began construction of a new PVC plant in Kalush. Run by Lukoils Ukrainian subsidiary, Zao Lukor, the Kalush-based firm is investing around US$210mn to establish Ukraines first PVC production facility, with planned capacity of 300,000tpa. Uhde has been appointed the contractor for the plant. The new unit was expected to be completed and operating some time during 2009. However, the slump in the PVC market casts doubt on the viability of the operation, which could be delayed until 2010. The KarpatNaftoKhim plant would produce plastic for windows and aluminium window profiles, which Ukraine currently does not produce. The investment is in addition to the US$600mn that Lukoil-Neftekhim is investing in the construction of a chlor-alkali plant also at Kalush. KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of the new plant in June 2007. The new facility will have capacity to produce about 206,000tpa of caustic soda and 181,000tpa of chlorine, and was originally expected to come online in Q208. However, the plants opening has been repeatedly postponed, with KarpatNaftoKhim announcing a further delay in March 2009. The plant is now scheduled to come onstream in Q309. KarpatNaftoKhim discontinued operations at its old chlorine and caustic soda facility in August 2006, largely owing to the impact of high raw-material and energy costs. Together, the two projects in Kalush will establish a major industrial petrochemicals and plastics facility sufficient to supply the construction sector. Currently, raw materials from KarpatNaftoKhim are exported to other countries in the region, where they are processed and re-imported as finished products. In April 2007, the Russian-British company TNK-BP outlined plans to invest around US$400mn in its operational and marketing assets development in Ukraine during 2007-2010. It has suggested the scale of investment will depend on the countrys investment climate. Company executives have complained that the government has dragged out negotiations over refining investment, with little progress since mid-2006. The main reason for the delays is the deteriorating political situation, which is undermining the business environment. Additionally, TNK-BP claims that the government owes it US$64mn in VAT refunds and is dragging its feet on repayment, owing to political issues concerning the governments financial programme. The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute dominated the last quarter, with the row having devastating effects on the already troubled petrochemicals sector in Ukraine. Chemicals and petrochemicals production shrank close Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Upstream Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 to 50% in January 2009 as the sector effectively ground to a halt during the dispute. Continuing tensions further threaten future output levels and prospects for the sector. In early January 2009, the Kremlin cut off gas supplies running through Ukraines pipelines, which deliver around 80% of Russias gas exports to Europe that is, around one-fifth of Europes gas leaving many European customers without gas for nearly two weeks. Russia initially cut supplies to Ukraine on January 1 after the two countries failed to agree on a 2009 supply deal. Six days later, gas exports to Europe flowing through Ukraine were stopped after Russia accused Kiev of stealing gas. Exports were resumed on January 20 with the signing of a 10-year supply and transit contract. The transit deal should see Russian gas monopoly Gazprom export 120bcm of gas to Europe via Ukraine in 2009. Ukraine is set to import 40bcm, according to the supply deal, although Kiev said it only needs 33bcm from Russia to partially meet its 2009 needs of 56bcm. Ukrainian gas will contribute 20bcm. There is a possibility that Ukraine so badly hit by the economic crisis will be unable to meet Russian payment demands. In March 2009 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promised Russia would not push Ukraine over the edge with high gas bills, saying that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. However, Putin had earlier threatened that Russia would cut off supplies if bills went unpaid. Tensions over gas payments have also revived feuding between Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. According to state gas company Naftogaz, Ukraine imported 49bcm for domestic use in 2008. In late March 2009, Russia broke off talks with Ukraine on a US$5bn loan to shore up its economy, after Kiev asked the EU to help modernise its pipeline network with a view to increasing capacity, a move welcomed by the EU. Russia was angered at not being included in discussions, although Kiev maintained that there had been talks with Moscow. Russia has said that it wants to be involved in any modernisation, thus helping to secure gas supply to Europe, but some analysts suggest that Russia is trying to gain control of the strategic pipelines. Russian officials warned of further gas supply disruptions if the countrys interests were ignored. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine over unpaid gas supplies had earlier threatened to undermine supply of feedstock to the countrys fertiliser industry. In March 2008, Gazprom cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine by 25%, and threatened to cut a further 25% if Ukraine did not settle a US$600mn gas bill and sign contracts for the supply of gas in 2008. In response, Ukraine has accused Gazprom of failing to pay any gas transit fees since December 2007, a charge disputed by the Russians, who contest that no bill has been sent by Ukraine. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Naftogaz paid its debts to Gazprom in full on March 5 2009, averting fears of a repeat of the January disruptions to European gas supply. Following a warning from Russian Prime Minister Putin that gas deliveries to Ukrainian and European consumers would be halted unless Naftogazs debt for February gas deliveries was paid in full by March 7, the Ukrainian company sent Russia the final instalment of the US$360mn bill. Gazprom confirmed shortly afterwards that the payment had been received. In light of pressure on Ukraine to develop its own gas reserves, Chornomornaftogaz a wholly owned subsidiary of Naftogaz with responsibility for developing the offshore fields in the Black and Azov Seas signed a memorandum of understanding with China National Offshore Oil Corp in February 2009 to bring China into a project building a pipeline to the Odessa gas deposits. The Ukrainian government is yet to approve the MoU. In addition, Chornomornaftogaz reports that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering investing in the Black Sea fields. In November 2008, Naftogaz requested a US$476mn investment by the state in developing the Odessa, Bezymyanny and Subbotin fields. The draft state budget in September 2008 had reportedly allocated around US$80mn to the project, although it is unclear if that amount has been reallocated in light of Ukraines economic troubles. Ukraine has six oil refineries, most of which are Russian-owned, with a combined capacity of 51mn tpa. In recent years, the load rate of refineries has declined, with the deterioration of the infrastructure and the temporary halting of the work of the Odessa and Kherson refineries leading to a 30% efficiency rate. Ukrainian refineries fail to meet Euro-5 standards and only the Lysychansk refinery is able to produce oil to Euro-4 standards and the Odessa refinery complies with Euro-3. All other refineries are unable to even meet Euro-2 compliance. However, the Oil and Gas Journal reported in March 2009 that Paris-based Axens has been awarded a contract to upgrade the gasoline pool at the Kremenchug refinery, which will enable the production of Euro-5 grade gasoline by 2011. The 360,000b/d refinery has the largest throughput capacity in Ukraine and the upgrade is the first of its kind in the country. In addition, TNK-BP said that it had completed upgrades on its Lysychansk refinery, which would see the plant through to 2010, and was considering investing some US$41mn in 2009 to modernise its Linos refinery. The company also announced its intentions to maintain production levels of oil products in 2009, despite falling consumption. TNK-BP, which refined 10mn tonnes of gas and oil condensates in 2008, hopes to pick up the slack from declining imports. The volume of oil refining of Ukrainian refineries meets only 80% of demand and the country is heavily dependent on imported oil, even with a major decline in demand since independence. Despite some efforts at exploration, oil production has remained relatively stable since 1991, with the Oil and Gas Journal putting the countrys proven reserves at 395mn bbl in 2007. Poor capacity utilisation has an impact further downstream, raising prices and causing a squeeze on naphtha supply for feedstock for the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 petrochemicals sector. However, small-scale progress has been reported at the Lelyaki oil field, which is being developed by the Kashtan Petroleum JV. Output is now 400bbl/d and further wells are to be drilled in 2009. In June 2008, details emerged of a plan to build a new oil refinery in Ukraine to process Caspian oil, although the current status of the project is unclear. The refinery would be a joint project involving Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and the EBRD. The refinery would cost US$4bn to build over a three- to five-year period. Possible sites include the Odessa or Lviv regions. The refinery would help overcome Ukraines infrastructural problems in the refining sector and will meet Euro-5 standards, enabling it to supply the EU market. Production at the refinery is expected to reach 10mn tpa of oil. In Q108, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine accused TNK-BP of being a monopolist, claiming that there was a correlation between the Lisichansk and Kremenchug refineries that suggested inflated price-fixing. TNK-BP has strongly denied the accusations. In a statement released in March, the company pointed out that imports account for 40-60% of the fuel market with the share of domestic refiners not exceeding 50%. It claimed that the Lisichansk refinery was loss-making and was only able to defend its existing market share with no plans to expand and push back the market share of foreign producers. Concluding, the company said that prices were determined by market forces and competition with imports and that it was therefore unable to determine fuel prices on the Ukrainian market. If the Antimonopoly Committee takes action, it could seek to split up the companys activities in the refining, wholesale and retail areas. This would disrupt the vertical integration of the petrochemicals company. Ukraine formally acceded to the WTO in May 2008, having secured approval of its membership bid in February that year. For Ukraines petrochemicals producers, WTO membership is a major positive step, easing access to both raw materials and promising better access to Western markets in the future. After the political chaos of the last few years, accession underlines for big business at least that the newly installed government under Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is capable of delivering on trade and economic policy. Membership effectively ends Ukraines trade agreement with Russia, which enables Russian petrochemicals to be exported to Ukraine free of duty. Under WTO rules, Ukraine will be unable to grant preferential import tariffs. Russian petrochemicals products will be subject to a 10% tariff. This will be of benefit to Ukrainian producers of raw materials, but will push up the cost of feedstock for plants operating further downstream, which often rely on raw-materials imports from Russia. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 WTO Accession Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Ukrainian plastics production failed to show any recovery in output in the first three quarters of 2009. Sales by the chemicals and petrochemicals industries in the period totalled UAH29bn, including UAH21bn of chemicals and UAH8bn of rubber and plastics products. In the January-September period, output totalled 222,000 tonnes. In September 2009, monthly plastic production was 30,100 tonnes, 2,700 tonnes up on August, the highest monthly rate in the whole of 2009 but still well down on typical output levels. Over the period, overall chemicals and petrochemical production was down 30% y-o-y, although the rate of decline was easing. The figures are not surprising given that Ukraine is one of the worlds worst-hit countries in the global economic crisis and mirrored the 28% y-o-y decline seen throughout the industrial sector. Key petrochemicals consuming industries reported significant declines. Construction was the hardest hit sector, falling by around a half. Even the fertiliser segment, which is traditionally more stable than other major petrochemical consumers such as the automotive and construction industries, reported massive decline in production volumes despite modest growth in agriculture. The steep recession comes after a prolonged period of economic growth, when economic growth averaged around 7%. The IMF has forecast that Ukraines economy will shrink 8% in 2009, while the World Bank says the fall will be more than 9%. In 2010, BMI envisages GDP growth of 1%, up from -14% in 2009. However, Ukraine is unlikely to return to the 7%+ levels seen before the recession. Consequently, it could take two or three years for the Ukrainian petrochemicals market to return to pre-recession levels. At the same time, the outlook for petrochemicals exports is bleak with the Russian, Turkish and EU markets also set to see sharp declines in demand. With the kind of economic growth rates seen in 2000-2007 unlikely to be repeated, the petrochemicals industry will be more heavily reliant on export markets. The depreciation of the hryvnia may provide some slight relief in terms of competitiveness, but equally it raises the cost of feedstock that has to be passed on to the consumer or absorbed by a financially precarious petrochemicals industry. If the demand does not exist, then depreciation is unlikely to make a significant difference. Russian economic growth is not likely to be remarkable over the forecast period and the market is at risk of over-capacity owing to additional planned capacity due to come online. Consequently, Ukrainian producers will be more reliant on the eurozone for sales. The petrochemicals industry is set to receive a temporary domestic boost from increased construction activity ahead of Ukraines joint hosting of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship, or Euro 2012. Added to that is the strongly pro-cyclical trend evident in the petrochemicals sector, with peaks being higher than average industrial output and troughs a lot lower. As industrial output plunges, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Industry Forecast Scenario Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 petrochemicals production will fall at a faster rate. As a result, new capacity plans such as the PVC plant in Kalush are likely to be halted or abandoned altogether as credit availability dries up and demand collapses both at home and among Ukraines main trading partners. Lukoil-Neftekhim began construction of a US$250mn PVC plant at Kalush in Q108, whose output will include 300,000tpa of PVC, in addition to a US$600mn chlorine and sodium hydroxide plant. BMI doubts that construction will be completed until 2010 or later owing to the depth and length of Ukraines economic recession. A diversification in markets and feedstock sourcing to remove the industrys dependence on domestic and Russian demand would enhance prospects. In 2010, we expect petrochemicals output growth of 6%, rising to 8% per annum in 2011-2013, in line with the pro-cyclical nature of the industry. In the long term, the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector will depend on a continuous and reliable source of feedstock. According to a study by the Ukrainian National Academy of Science, Ukraines natural gas consumption could double by 2030, while the countrys natural gas production may only increase by 33% over that period. Supplies from Russia have been subjected to severe political disputes between the two countries that may not have been conclusively resolved. Naftogaz Ukrainy is considering other sources of natural gas, including Iran and Norway. With construction of a gas pipeline from Iran to Armenia under development, Ukraine believes that an Iran-Armenia-Georgia-Crimea pipeline is possible, linking the pipeline from Georgia across the Black Sea to Ukraines Crimean port of Feodosia. Iran is looking to increase its natural gas imports to Europe, and Ukraine is interested in maintaining its position as the major transit point for natural gas to Europe. However, the distance and substantial projected cost of such a pipeline has so far inhibited the implementation of this plan. The threat to gas supplies from Russia is a significant downside risk to Ukrainian petrochemicals as it denies the industry access to ethane feedstock. The government has, in the past, found it difficult to find the money to finance its debt to Russias Gazprom. We caution that given the firm's financial difficulties, a potential disruption to gas supplies in 2010 when Ukraine begins to pay full market price for its imports. In terms of naphtha feedstock potential, there is no immediate need for an increase in nameplate oil refining capacity as it is already surplus to domestic requirements at 1mn b/d, which makes it unlikely that Ukraine will secure more domestic naphtha supply in the near future. However, in the long-term, there is scope for investment in new refineries and modernisation of existing refineries, which are experiencing low levels of capacity utilisation. Polish petrochemical and refining company PKN Orlen indicated in 2008 that it may consider investing in a new refinery to be built near Brody. In May 2009, Ukraine and Libya reached initial agreements to construct a new 200,000b/d oil refinery in the Odessa region. Tripoli has also preliminarily agreed to provide 4mn bbl to the existing Kremenchug refinery, which has suffered supply disruptions following the souring of Kiev's relationship with Moscow. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 38 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Any level of uncertainty concerning feedstock will have negative consequences for the petrochemicals sector, with a shortage of feedstock for its cracker units. BMI believes that gas price hikes will lead to a downturn in ethylene output, with exports projected to decline to zero over the forecast period. Ethylene output could be in the range of 200,000-250,000tpa over the next five years. Cuts in ethylene output will increase dependency on PE imports, with the domestic industry without a ready availability of feedstock. Ukraine is also set to become more dependent on PP imports. An improvement in the business environment and greater certainty over gas imports and prices would alleviate some of the problems facing the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. At present, the deteriorating domestic political environment makes it unlikely that Ukraine will see an expansion in production capacity over the next two to three years.

Source: World Cracker Report, CMAI UEFA 2012 Key To Medium-Term Growth Outlook We maintain our view that Ukraine's economy will continue contracting through the second half of the year, albeit at a slower pace than that recorded in H109. We project real GDP expanding an average 3%, although we caution that should UEFA cut the number of Ukrainian cities hosting the tournament , it would necessitate a downward revision to this forecast. A recent data release from the State Statistics Committee designed to approximate GDP output shows Ukraine's economy contracting 18% y-o-y in real terms in Q209, slightly better than the 20% fall recorded in the first quarter of the year . Although a full breakdown of GDP into its expenditure components is unavailable, we expect the same factors that drove the economy's decline in Q1 to have remained firmly in play through the second quarter of the year. We note that Ukraine's recession is broad based, with investment, consumption and trade indicators all showing precipitous declines in y-o-y terms. While we are encouraged that the recession appears to have now troughed, we maintain our view that the economy is likely to continue contracting through at least the third and fourth quarters of the year. Although Ukraine's export sector looks set to rebound in H2 along with the tentative recovery in external demand across the globe, we caution that private consumption will nevertheless remain subdued, thus constraining the economy's ability to avert a protracted downturn. According to latest data, a slight improvement in industrial output was recorded in July, with production expanding by 4% month-on-month , after growing by 3% m-o-m in June. This was driven primarily by a surge in steel output, which expanded by 15% m-o-m amid a tentative return of external demand . We note, however, that with economic activity beginning to pick up in the more developed states of Western Europe, Ukraine's export sector will also be given a slight boost as a consequence of the depreciation of the hryvnia, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. In contrast, latest retail sales data from the State Statistics Committee showing a contraction of 21% yo-y in July underscores our relatively bleak outlook for household consumption. With the private sector set to account for years of Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 Macroeconomic Outlook Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 excessive borrowing through a prolonged period of deleveraging, and unemployment spiralling higher, the ability of the Ukrainian consumer to drive growth will remain impaired. Compounded with instability in the banking sector, which has seen the domestic lending channel seize up, the outlook is certainly bleak. Accordingly, as private household consumption accounts for approximately 60% of total GDP, we are confident that the economy's recovery process through 2010 will be weak. Although we forecast real GDP expanding by 1% next year, we maintain our core view that this will be a reflection of low base effects as opposed to any uptick in economic activity. Investment And UEFA Given Ukraine's commitment to hosting Euro 2012, data releases showing a steep decline in fixed investment is of particular concern, and does not bode well for the country's medium-term growth outlook. Official data for the first quarter of the year show gross fixed capital formation contracting 48% y-o-y, well below the 19% rate of growth recorded in Q108, and highlights the scope of the macroeconomic crisis engulfing the country. With both private consumption and exports set to remain subdued beyond 2009, large-scale investments to underlying transportation infrastructure and the hospitality industry in the run-up to the championship will play an increasingly important role in supporting growth. That said, with ructions in parliament continuing to jeopardise the government's ability to make progress in its preparation efforts, we warn of the growing risk that three of the four cities may lose their right to host the championship. During their latest visit to Ukraine, UEFA officials cautioned authorities that delays in the construction of key infrastructure was jeopardising the country's ability to host the championship. In addition, in early September there was still uncertainty surrounding how President Yushchenko's vetoing of recently passed legislation that sought to have the National Bank of Ukraine transfer funding for the championship over to the state budget would play out. While we hold to our projection for real GDP growth to average 3% between 2011-2013, we caution that a UEFA decision to strip one or more of these cities of this right could necessitate a slight downward revision to our forecast.

Source and notes: 1 State Statistics Committee; 2 ILO methodology Table: Ukraine Economic Activity, 2006-2013 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Background Company Data KarpatNaftoKhim, previously known as Lukor, is Ukraines only producer of VCM, and is a major producer of olefins, polyolefins and other petrochemicals. KarpatNaftoKhim was established in October 2004 after closure of the main facilities of the JV Lukor. In June 2006, Lukoil-Neftekhim announced plans to invest an additional US$100mn in the statutory fund of KarpatNaftoKhim, if it agreed to sign an amicable agreement after disputes regarding operations. KarpatNaftoKhim operates a petrochemicals complex at Kalush in Ukraine. The closed-end JSC Lukor was established by Lukoil-Neftekhim and the Ukrainian open-end JSC Oriana on December 6 2000, with a statutory fund of UAH1bn . Lukoil-Neftekhim had a 52% stake in the project, while Oriana held the remaining 48%. Lukoil has been one of the largest investors in the Ukrainian petrochemicals sector. KarpatNaftoKhim is the nations only producer of LDPE and VCM and a major producer of ethylene, propylene, benzene, caustic soda and other petrochemicals products. It has the capacity to produce 100,000 tonnes of PE, 370,000 tonnes of VCM and 250,000tpa of ethylene. The company exports most of its petrochemicals products to Russia, the EU and Turkey. In March 2008, KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of a new PVC plant in Kalush. Around US$210mn is being invested to establish Ukraines first PVC production facility, with planned capacity of 300,000tpa. Uhde has been appointed the contractor for the plant. The new unit was expected to be completed and operating some time during 2009. However, the slump in the PVC market casts doubt on the operations viability. It could be delayed until 2010. The KarpatNaftoKhim plant would produce plastic for windows and aluminium window profiles, which Ukraine currently does not produce. The investment is in addition to the US$600mn that Lukoil-Neftekhim is investing in the construction of a chlor-alkali plant also at Kalush. KarpatNaftoKhim began construction of the new plant in June 2007. The new facility will have capacity to produce about 206,000tpa of caustic soda and 181,000tpa of chlorine, and was originally expected to come online in Q208.

The plant is now scheduled to come onstream in Q309. The outlook for the petrochemicals is so poor, however, that there is a chance that these projects will be further delayed, or even abandoned. KarpatNaftoKhim already reportedly suspended operations temporarily in July 2008, owing to a decline in demand for ethylene. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 TNK-BP Background Company Data TNK-BP Ukraine began operations on June 11 2004. Linos had been TNK-BPs main refinery asset in Ukraine. Russian oil group TNK owned a 78% stake in the Linos oil refinery and petrochemicals complex situated in the Lugansk region of eastern Ukraine. TNK-BP was formed in 2003 by the merger of TNK and BPs Russian business and has interests in Ukraines downstream sector. The company has a 78% interest in the 320,000b/d capacity LiNOS refinery in the eastern Lugansk region, although its actual share of production is lower. The facility also incorporates the countrys sole polypropylene facility. In addition, TNK-BP operates a network of over 925 franchised service stations. The firm also owns a share of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline, which supplies the Pivdennyi Oil Export Terminal. While there is no upstream exposure and little scope for the Anglo-Russian group to establish a presence, the company is strong in refining and fuels distribution. All Ukraines refineries operate well below design capacity, are relatively inefficient and lack complexity. TNK-BP has an opportunity to upgrade, raise throughput and feed a growing chain of outlets as the local market grows. However, the investment climate in Ukraine remains uncertain, which will be a concern for BP in particular. TNK-BP corporate centre in Ukraine manages the groups enterprises, including sales and production facilities and investment companies. The complex includes a cracker with an ethylene production capacity of 300,000tpa that is also capable of producing propylene, as well as the countrys only PP plant. However, in February 2006, it was reported that TNK-BP had stopped using the services of Linos. The agreement with Linos on the lease of the refinery has been cancelled. From January 1 2006, TNK-BP has been refining its oil in Ukraine at the Lisichansk oil refinery, owned and managed by CJSC LINIK. In November 2006, the Lisichansk oil refinery announced a planned processing capacity of about 260,000 tonnes of oil. The plant had undergone an annual maintenance turnaround procedure to rebuild the reactor block and to replace the vacuum gas-oil catalyser of the catalytic cracking unit. The project also Address TNK-BP Ukraine 12 Vladimirskaya Street 01025 Kyiv, Ukraine Tel: +380 4449 29777 Fax: +380 4449 29888 Web: www.tnk-bp.com.ua Key Statistics Year incorporated: 2000 Key Personnel President : Alexander Gorodetsky Vice-President (TNK-BP Ukraine): Sergey Lizunov Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 included replacing the piping of the hydrogen furnaces, the control equipment and system for oil-processing. In April 2007, TNK-BP outlined plans to invest around US$400mn in its operational and marketing assets development in Ukraine in 2007-2010. It has suggested the scale of investment will depend on the countrys investment climate. Executives have complained the government has dragged out negotiations over refining investment, with little progress since mid-2006. The main reason for the delays is the deteriorating political situation, which is undermining the business environment. TNK-BP claims that the government owes it US$64mn in VAT refunds and is dragging its feet on repayment, owing to political issues concerning the governments financial programme. TNK-BP said in early 2009 that it had completed upgrades on its Lysychansk refinery, which would see the plant through to 2010, and was considering investing some US$41mn in 2009 to modernise its Linos refinery. The company also announced its intentions to maintain production levels of oil products in 2009, despite falling consumption. TNK-BP, which refined 10mn tonnes of gas and oil condensates in 2008, hopes to pick up the slack from declining imports. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Stirol Background Company Data Stirol is active through five subsidiaries: Stirolchemtrade, which produces and exports products such as liquid nitric fertilisers, ammonia, urea and ammonium nitrate; Stirolchembyt, which produces and sells enamels, paints, acrylic mixtures and building adhesives; Stirol Biopharm, which produces pharmaceutical products; JSC Stirol Pack, which produces consumer goods, PS and PE products; and Stirol IT, which deals in software development and repair and selling of computer hardware. By the end of 2006, five production units had been set up, including a foamed PS facility. The PS facility has led to an increase in capacity to 50,000tpa. Stirol stopped its ammonia-producing workshop to conduct major repair work owing to a breakdown that took place on September 11 2006. In 2007, Stirols export of urea grew by 23%, urea-ammonia solutions by 221%, PS by 35%, sodium nitrate by 38%, sodium nitrite by 5% and amino resins by 52%. The companys gross revenue increased by 18% y-oy in 2007. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation rose by 18% to UAH364mn, while earnings before interest and taxes rose by 22% to UAH280mn. In the first eight months of 2008, Stirol reportedly increased sales and production volumes for all its primary final products. The company website also reported that growth rates were maintained despite the economic crisis. In October 2008, ammonia production was up 4% y-o-y and urea production was up 3%.

Source: ILO, BMI Table: Average Annual Wages, 2000-2012 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 BMIs industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variables own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variables own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historic data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Plant Capacity The ability of a country to produce basic chemical products depends on domestic plant capacity. The number and size of ethylene crackers determines both a countrys likely output, and also its relative efficiency as a producer. We therefore examine: Stated year-end capacity for key petrochemicals products, mainly ethylene, but also propylene, polypropylene, polyethylene and so forth. Government, company and third-party sources are used; Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts Chemicals and Petrochemicals Industry Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 Specific company and/or government capacity expansion projects aimed at increasing the number and/or size of crackers and downstream processing facilities. Chemicals Supply A mixture of methods is used to generate supply forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Basic plant capacity and historic utilisation rates. Unless a company imports chemicals products for domestic re-sale, supply is expected to be governed by production capacity; Underlying economic growth trends. The chemicals industry is highly cyclical. Strong domestic or regional demand should be met by increased supply and higher plant utilisation rates; Third-party projections from national and international industry trade associations. Chemicals Demand Various methods are used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Underlying economic growth trends. The chemicals industry is highly cyclical. Strong domestic or regional demand is expected to require larger volumes of either domestically produced or imported olefins , polyolefins or downstream products; Trends in end-user industries. Strong demand for motor vehicles, construction materials, packaging products and pharmaceuticals imply rising demand for basic chemicals; Government/industry projections; Third-party forecasts from national and international industry trade associations etc. Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third party agency projections with the reported spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data, such as physical spending patterns ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Cross Checks Ukraine Petrochemicals Report Q1 2010 projections to check the chemicals balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. BMIs Petrochemicals Business Environment Rating has three objectives. First, we have defined the risks rated in order to accurately capture the operational dangers to companies operating in this industry globally. Second, we have, where possible, identified objective indicators. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a nuanced manner in order to ensure that only the aspects most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the ratings system which integrates with those of all industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the ratings system divides into two distinct areas, with the indicators included in each area stated below: Limits Of Potential Returns Evaluation of sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development. Risks To Realisation Of Returns Evaluation of industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of anticipated returns being realised over the assessed time period. Indicators The following indicators have been used. Overall, the rating uses three subjectively measured indicators, and 41separate indicators/datasets. Table: Petrochemicals Business Environment Indicators And Rationale Limits to potential returns Rationale Market structure Cracker capacity, current year Objective measure of sector size Cracker capacity, 2011 Forecast of sector development Downstream capacity, current year Objective measure of domestic demand Country structure Financial infrastructure Rating from BMIs Country Risk Rating to denote ease of obtaining investment finance.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 BMI estimates that US defence spending totalled US498bn in 2010, by some way the biggest defence budget in the world. However, defence outlay fell 24% from 2009 in nominal terms and down 25% in constant price terms, though it should be noted that spending rose 7% in 2009 and 10% in 2008 as stimulus measures took effect and the demands of the military surge in Iraq were felt. Defence expenditure equalled US$1,610 per head in 2010, and 3% of GDP, well above the 2% target recommended by NATO, the military alliance of which the US is the leading member, and accounted for 17% of government expenditure, down from 18% in 2009 but still a high proportion for a developed country. As some fiscal savings have been made, defence has taken a bigger hit than average, reflecting other priorities for the Obama administration, not least health care. In 2011 BMI expects defence spending to rise 2% to US$509bn, or US$1,630 per capita, as the US economy recovers and medium-term fiscal loosening continues to take effect. Defence will rise as a proportion of government expenditure, to 17%, though it will remain at 3% of GDP. Over the forecast period, to 2015, we expect steady nominal terms defence spending growth as the US invests steadily in its armed forces. In constant price terms, expenditure will rise to 1% in 2011 and to 3in 2015. Spending is likely to remain at 3% of GDP, but rise steadily as a proportion of government spending to 19% in 2019. This reflects the expectation that the US will continue to ensure that its military retains a cutting edge in a world in which new threats are emerging, and in which China, potentially a major strategic rival, is set to overtake it as the worlds largest economy between 2019 and 2025, depending on which forecast is used. It also indicates that defence spending growth will outstrip broader public spending expansion, an indicator of the importance that the country places on defence and security. By 2019 BMI expects US defence spending to total US$661bn, or US$1,975 per capita. There are both upside and downside factors that could affect this outlook. Defence expenditure may rise higher if the US becomes embroiled in another overseas conflict, for example with Iran or North Korea, although Washington would be loath to become involved in another bloody ground war abroad. Furthermore, a serious terrorist attack could lead to higher security spending and potential involvement abroad. If the US perceives China as becoming more belligerent, it might increase its military presence in East Asia, for example in South Korea and in the seas around, and perhaps in Central Asia. Deployments, even peaceable ones, could incur higher costs. On the other hand, should the US economic recovery be reversed a possibility that cannot be ruled out there would be fewer resources to invest in the military. The US is arguably over-dependent on Chinese economic growth and Chinas willingness to buy US Treasuries and should these pillars of support prove fragile, the outcome for the US economy could be serious. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Executive Summary United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The Afghan government announced in January 2011 that it had not yet discussed the potential establishment of a permanent US military base in the Central Asian country, Xinhua reported. The fact that Afghanistan has not refuted the idea outright may indicate that it is a real possibility. Through a potential base, the US could monitor developments in the energy-rich but unstable Central Asia region, a major area of contention between major powers for centuries. A base would also allow the US to respond more quickly to threats in the region, and potentially act as a check on Russian and Chinese influence in Afghanistan. Many observers feel that, should the US withdraw from Afghanistan completely, they will leave the country vulnerable to Beijing and Moscows influence. Were a base to be established, Washington would have to handle the overseas diplomacy and domestic political reaction very carefully, so the process is likely to be a long, drawn-out affair. The American public mood towards the Afghanistan operation is still pessimistic, despite signs of some stabilisation since the US started its troop surge. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 US Security SWOT Strengths The Obama administration is showing a greater willingness than its predecessor to negotiate with countries that represent security and transnational threats. This may help reduce the long-term threat to US interests abroad and to domestic security. Unprecedented and unrivalled level of technological military expertise. Border security has been enhanced through close collaboration with Canada and Mexico and by technological protection installations, eg US$100mn for Non-Intrusive Inspection technology by the Department of Homeland Security . The government set up a dedicated department within the DHS to bring together all parties involved in counterterrorism, counter-WMD, aviation and cyber security. The US practices a strict immigration control policy. Weaknesses The US was collectively traumatised by the 9/11 attacks. The US entered two very expensive conflicts as part of the war on terror, which shows little sign of ending in the next five years and is set to expand into other territories such as Yemen and Pakistan. Obama is prioritising his healthcare reform plan over and above other policies, including foreign policy. The US is poorly placed to deal forcefully with Iran and North Korea, due to the enormity of repercussions following any form of military intervention and the great economic costs, as well as the difficulty in getting Russia and China on board. The military is still coming to grips with the problems of asymmetric warfare, getting bogged down in conflicts prolonged by protracted and unpredictable insurgencies and innovative, improvised terrorist attacks. Obamas willingness to negotiate is not bearing fruit, shown by stalling of negotiations in the Middle East peace process over Israels illegal construction of additional Jewish settlements. Institutional inertia in way of the presidents reforms and the defence review in 2010. The US lacks the experience of a prolonged terrorist campaign against it at home or abroad, hence the need to catch up with technological and intelligence-led counterterrorism methods, and to improve communications between agencies. Forces will be active in Afghanistan for years to come. There is a danger US forces will become overstretched if the war on terror is extended beyond its theatres. The Afghan front is expanding to combat the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Cooperation from Pakistan will be crucial. The US is ranked 85th among 149 countries assessed in the Institute for Economics and Peaces 2010 Global Peace Index. Opportunities The extra resources for Afghanistan promised by Obama are progressing with Operation Moshtarak. At the same time, the US is expanding its programmes of reconstruction, education and hearts and minds operations to foster the beginnings of economic development. Some progress has been achieved in priming the Afghan forces to take control of operations. The defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan is regarded as a top priority to enhance security in the region and dismantle a main breeding ground for exportable terrorism. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009 earmarked US$1bn for explosives detection systems and checkpoint screening equipment to enhance transport security. This programme is set to expand since the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight approaching Detroit on December 25 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 SWOT Analysis United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The US is leading global initiatives to improve port security (the Megaports and Proliferation Security initiatives), and security for WMD materials and stockpiling in the former Soviet Union and Pakistan. Opportunities are constantly afforded by advanced research and development in defence, security and other major industries serving the sector. Threats While the US mainland is relatively safer from acts of terrorism than many other countries, its size, ethnic and political diversity and domestic social tensions make the threat of homeland attack a continuing reality from a range of sources, including non- Islamist groups and lone wolf attackers (eg Oklahoma City bombing 1995, 2001 anthrax attacks), including home-growns. US policymakers and experts tend to plan for a catastrophic event, given the countrys experience of 9/11, rather than for a sustained domestic terrorist campaign. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism at home and abroad is regarded as a continuing threat, based more on the intent of groups than their true capability. The authorities need to get back to basics and be more aware of commonplace or improvised materials being used in sporadic, rather than centrally planned, acts of terrorism. Russia and China are no longer classed as enemies, but the Pentagon still sees them as potential threats. Both countries have modernised their armed and nuclear forces. There is a threat of the infiltration of organisations by terrorists seeking to get insider intelligence, materials and technologies. Islamist groups pose less of a domestic threat than in Europe and other regions. If unemployment continues to rise at home it may foster social malcontents. In Afghanistan, improvised explosive devices continue to be the main threat to US forces and 2009 was the bloodiest year for roadside bomb fatalities. Other threats include explosively formed penetrators used in Iraq, which slice through armoured vehicles at high velocity, and increasingly large IEDs. The US is still adapting to the war on terror on several fronts. Somalia and Yemen are the latest burgeoning breeding grounds for al-Qaeda and Somalia has already been the source of many piracy incidents in 2008 and 2009. More resources are being demanded to deal with cyber attacks. An unanticipated and abrupt change in command of US forces in Afghanistan may lend weight to views that the campaign will not be successful. US Defence Industry SWOT Strengths The US defence industry is the worlds richest and most advanced. The US accounts for half of the worlds total defence expenditure: US$1trn in 2006, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The industry earns hundreds of billions of dollars as the worlds leading defence exporter, provides many thousands of jobs and is one of the worlds most advanced research and development sectors. Obama has successfully put through the 2010 defence budget request to include the troop surge in Afghanistan and several procurement systems for the forces. The war on terror has given a huge boost to the industry since defence spending in 2002 was set at US$355bn the biggest increase in 20 years. Since the 1991 Gulf war, US combat aircraft have advanced their capabilities in firing precision weapons at selected targets. A notable advance for force protection is the MRAP and M-ATV vehicles. There is support in some circles to link defence expenditure to GDP in order to maintain consistent capacity-building, despite the US large deficit. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 US Security SWOT United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 US Defence Industry SWOT Weaknesses There is an enduring need to modernise equipment, strategy and tactics beyond their original Cold War missions. Equipment is needed to enable the US to fight guerrilla-style wars in urban settings and terrain that easily hides insurgents. Huge procurement demands for large numbers of troops often mean delays in getting equipment to the field. Funding for defence is a highly complex and lengthy process that goes through multiple stages. Costs rise substantially from original estimate of project to its conclusion. The cost of a Pratt & Whitney engine for the F-35 fighter has risen by US$1bn since 2002, according to The Washington Post. Product ground tests may be unsuccessful, jeopardising existing and future contracts. Much of the funding is for operations in ongoing wars, which is set to increase in the next two years. Some long-term programmes are under threat from consequent budget cuts, despite the overall increase in the defence budget. Reports criticise low value for government dollars spent on defence equipment. Potential International Traffic in Arms Regulations reform may be stymied by the Congress and Senate. Opportunities Government funding for defence kick starts many projects and keeps them on stream. More money is being spent on counter-IED training and technology. As of February 2009, the Joint IED Defeat Organization spent US$6bn on robotic explosives ordnance disposal and electronic jamming systems to counter bombs with simple electronic triggers. There is a vastly growing demand for EOD training programmes. Large awards are being made to meet the growing demand for new, more bomb-resistant MRAP vehicles and other enhancements to vehicles for mountain terrain deployment. Between February 2007 and mid-2008, MRAP orders increased from 1,000 to 14,000, according to Janes Defence Equipment & Technology research, to several leading companies. There is support for International Traffic in Arms Regulations reform and/or bilateral exemptions in the Obama administration. Threats The government may not be able to afford to sustain the Bush administrations levels of defence project funding. Competition from Europe and the Far East is increasing. The government will most likely rein in defence expenditure over the long term, as a massive structural item in the countrys deficit. US Political SWOT Strengths The US is an undisputed superpower, and therefore occupies centre-stage in most international diplomacy. Long-standing democracy with vigorous and open political debate; the US continues to attract large numbers of immigrants committed to citizenship and self-advancement. Weaknesses Political debate between Republicans and Democrats has tended to become more polarised and divisive. As today's superpower, the US attracts the enmity of a wide range of political groups opposed to the current international status quo. Opportunities The changing political mood (as evidenced by the popularity of unconventional candidates in the 2008 presidential election, including Obama's), and the widespread dissatisfaction of the voting public, may encourage both major parties to experiment with more consensual approaches to certain policy areas. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Threats The perception of inflexibility and bias in US foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East, may stiffen opposition and at worst provide fertile recruiting ground for radical anti-US groups such as al-Qaeda. Partly as a reaction to foreign policy difficulties, US public opinion may return to isolationist and protectionist modes. US Economic SWOT Strengths The world's largest economy with an impressive record of entrepreneurial dynamism, innovation, and a high research and development spend. Despite some threats to its reserve status, the US dollar is treated as an international currency, meaning that investors around the world are prepared to hold US debt. Because of this, the US is uniquely able to run large fiscal and current account deficits. Weaknesses Despite the dollar's role as an international currency, excessive US debt levels are a risk. A decision by Japanese and Chinese central banks to reduce their larger dollar holdings could cause sharp falls in the value of the US currency. Low savings rate by US households, although this has begun to reverse. Opportunities Further liberalisation of international trade through the WTO, coupled with a more competitive dollar exchange rate, could boost export growth and help restore balance to the US's external imbalances. Threats Intensified competition from China and other low-wage economies could accelerate the loss of manufacturing jobs. Large growth in public spending, coupled with tax cuts, will worsen the fiscal deficit, eventually forcing more restrictive monetary policy and slower growth. US Business Environment SWOT Strengths The US boasts the world's largest single internal consumer market, which presents tremendous opportunities for businesses of all types and sizes. Few countries offer better environments for entrepreneurial activity, with a highly flexible labour force, a legal system that is friendly to business, and significant centres of technological innovation . Weaknesses Much of the country's physical infrastructure is in need of improvement, with congested roads and airways. US corporate tax is, on average, among the highest in the OECD. Opportunities The Obama administration is committed to improving the nation's infrastructure, with stimulus package funds being dedicated to that purpose. The US has often been the origin of new drivers of economic growth booms, and sectors ranging from biotechnology to alternative energy are being discussed as possible catalysts. Threats Government intervention in the economy puts the country's reputation for free enterprise at risk. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 US Political SWOT United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Two years on from the start of the global financial crisis, it could be argued that political risks have been relatively mild, considering that we have subsequently passed through the worst economic downturn in 70 years, and that unemployment is running at its highest levels for many years. Very few countries, most notably Greece, have seen significant unrest and the 'global left' has largely failed to receive a boost from the criticism being heaped on deregulated financial systems and the perceived excesses of global capitalism. Furthermore, there has not been a notable shift to the left in elections held over the past yearor two. However, this does not mean that investors can lower their guard with respect to political risks. We believe these will remain salient throughout late 2010 and much of 2011, owing to the ongoing fallout from the recession and the likelihood of a secondary slowdown in 2011. Much of the domestic political risk stems from the fact that governments will need to make substantial cuts to their budget deficits in order to avoid Greece-style debt crises, although there will of course also be country-specific factors at work. On the international stage, we expect US-China relations to remain at the forefront, as the two continue to dispute their mutual exchange rate and Washington seeks to reassert its influence in South East Asia. Elsewhere, Iran's nuclear programme and the possibility of renewed unrest in Lebanon will remain key sources of tension in the Middle East. The war in Afghanistan will also continue to make headlines, raising doubts about whether US President Barack Obama can start to withdraw troops from 2011. In Asia we see scope for further animosity between the two Koreas, and between China and some of its neighbours over maritime disputes. Global Theme 1: Fiscal Cutbacks Many governments, especially European ones, need to rein in public spending in order to reduce their budget deficits, which have ballooned on the back of fiscal stimuli implemented from 2008 onwards. For the most part, the cutbacks have yet to take place, meaning that voters have yet to feel the pain. Unsurprisingly, the poorest are likely to be the worst-affected, since they tend to be the most reliant on social benefits. Therefore, there is scope for unemployment to remain high and with that rising public discontent and social ills, such as crime. The political implications of this will vary from country to country, but the ones with stronger trade unions can be expected to see mass mobilisation against spending cuts. These actions could force governments to adopt a 'go slow' approach to cutbacks, which could in turn raise investor concerns about fiscal consolidation. Even if there is not significant public unrest, governments will be wary of delivering too much pain in case this undermines their chances of re-election a few years hence. Global Theme 2: Heavily Divided Electorates Another key theme, mainly pervading Westminster-style electoral systems, is that voters are failing to Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Global Political Outlook United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 give convincing mandates to new governments. A good example is the UK election of 2010, where the Conservative Party failed to win a majority despite the unpopularity of the previous Labour government. This necessitated the first coalition government since World War II. Another example was the Australian election in August, which returned the Australian Labor Party-led coalition to power with the thinnest of majorities. Of course, hung parliaments, coalition rule, and contested elections are common around the world, but the fact that in some cases voters are failing to hand parties decisive majorities even amid heightened disillusion with incumbent governments underscores the sceptical mood among electorates. Global Theme 3: Inflation Risks In Emerging Markets One view that we have been promoting for some time is deflation in developed states and inflation in emerging markets. Regarding the latter, we remain vigilant about food price-induced inflation. Food comprises a far larger weighting in consumer price inflation baskets of emerging markets, meaning that these countries will bear the brunt of any major agricultural commodity increase. Although we do not expect a food-driven surge in CPI , we expect high food prices to remain a salient issue in many African and some Asian countries in the coming year. Afghanistan The war will continue to haunt Western leaders for the foreseeable future. The NATO-led force now stands at 150,000 troops, which exceeds the peak Soviet deployment of 120,000 in the 1980s. The US commander in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, is expected to continue his predecessor's strategy of securing the south, especially Kandahar, in order to weaken the Taliban sufficiently so that they will negotiate for peace. Nonetheless, the much-touted Kandahar offensive has been delayed, and in any case, the Taliban believes that it has time on its side. This is because US president Barack Obama is keen to start withdrawing troops from July 2011. However, Obama's timetable strikes us as being too optimistic, given that the war is currently at a stalemate. A premature withdrawal could be portrayed as a defeat, greatly undermining American prestige. We see a possibility that the Taliban will choose to 'melt away' during the coming year, only to resurge at a later date once Western forces start withdrawing or have been substantially reduced. Overall, we believe the Afghan war is not one that will have a clear-cut conclusion. Meanwhile, the US' bigger geopolitical problem stemming from the war is that it ties down a considerable amount of military resources and political capital, greatly reducing Washington's flexibility in responding to crises elsewhere in the world, for example, Iran, the Koreas and the Caucasus. Iran Rumours will continue to spring up periodically in the international media that the US and/or Israel is gearing up for an airstrike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although we still believe that the US and Israel will refrain from military action, we are less confident of this than we were at the start of 2010. Iran remains Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Global Hotspots United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 intransigent and the moment may eventually arrive, although not necessarily in 2010 or 2011, when the US and Israel will have to decide whether they can live with a nuclear Iran. A military strike on Iran would differ from the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which both featured land invasions, in that it would largely take the form of an extended air campaign. However, the risk is that a putative attack would fail to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, while making the clerics even more intransigent towards the US. If the US were to abstain, many doubt that Israel could carry out the attack by itself. However, Iran would probably interpret a solo Israeli strike as a de facto US strike and retaliate accordingly, most probably through the use of proxy groups in the Middle East and possibly far beyond. That said, we believe Iran's retaliatory means may have been exaggerated, although certainly even a short bombing campaign against the country would be seen by investors as a global crisis, leading to a spike in oil prices and concomitant risk aversion. Nonetheless, even if Iran were to become a nuclear power, it could be argued that it would not be so dangerous to Middle Eastern stability, because Tehran would be highly unlikely to use nuclear weapons, and because Israel has overwhelming nuclear retaliatory capabilities. The Korean Peninsula The Korean Peninsula has calmed down following the North's sinking of the Southern warship Cheonan on March 26, 2010, but it will remain a potential flashpoint. While both sides and their respective backers, China and the US, will seek to de-escalate tensions, we do not preclude further maritime clashes between North and South that could cause casualties. North Korea is undergoing a delicate succession process of transferring power from Kim Jong Il to his son Kim Jong Un, which needs the support of the military. The two Kims may resort to more brinkmanship to placate this constituency. We continue to see the possibility of a third nuclear test, which could take place at a time of Pyongyang's political convenience over the coming year. Over 2011, we expect Kim Jong Un to become more visible, following his political debut at the September 2010 Korean Workers' Party conference.

Source: BMI, Reuters, Local media United States: Obama To Be Tested By Mid-Term Elections The key event to watch will be mid-term congressional and gubernatorial elections in November. A total of 39 governorships , all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, and 36 of the 100 senate seats are being contested. The state of the economy has traditionally been one of the biggest concerns for voters in past US elections, including the 2008 Democratic landslide. This will be no exception in 2010, and given our core forecast for a weaker economy in H210 and a persistently weak labour market, we believe that voters will punish incumbents. As such, we envisage the Republican Party winning control of the House of Representatives, although the Democrats are still well positioned to retain the Senate. Perhaps the biggest issue at stake is the government's fiscal policy. We believe that the mid-term elections could be a prelude to greater austerity, despite President Obama's desire to underpin aggregate demand via fiscal stimulus. Firstly, the rise of the Tea Party movement has already had a significant impact on several individual races, with several of the movement's chosen candidates winning Republican Party primary elections. The Tea Party is pushing for libertarian policies in Washington, including a curb on government spending growth. Should the electorate back key Tea Party candidates, for example, if Sharron Angle defeats Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the Nevada senate election, which is entirely possible, we doubt whether there would be much political impetus for a second round of government stimulus. Secondly, the bailouts surrounding the economic stimulus packages have not gone down well with the public. Although government stimulus helped prevent the recession from being worse than it was, the prospect of higher taxes in 2011 and sustained record high government deficits amid a tepid economic recovery is forcing voters to rethink their support for further stimulus. The bottom line is that fiscal austerity may be on the cards in H210 and in 2011, whether or not the economy has fully recovered. This reinforces our view that economic growth should slow significantly over that period. Other economic measures could also be affected by this agenda. Should China fail to allow significant appreciation of the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 Election type Date Ruling party or candidate Opposition party or candidate Expected outcome United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 yuan, for example, the stage would be set for a significant increase in rhetoric from legislators on both sides of the aisle, with calls for protectionist measures not out of the question. Even if the Democrats lose ground in November, we caution against writing off Obama's re-election prospects in 2012. Much can happen in the next two years that could shore up his position. Brazil It now looks highly likely that President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva's chosen successor, Dilma Rouseff, will win the presidential election in October, with a mandate to continue her predecessor's policy trajectory. We expect Brazil to continue playing an increasingly prominent diplomatic role at both regional and global levels, although this will likely mean ongoing implicit support for some of the more populist regimes in the region, and a potentially tense relationship with neighbours controlled by more centre-right, US-allied governments. Overall though, we have no major concerns about Brazil's direction. Andean Region The new Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, has ramped up the fight against the insurgent Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia , with several successful military operations shortly after his inauguration on August 7. As the government continues to neutralise the FARC leadership and reclaim areas of operations, we could see desperate measures by the insurgents, such as an increased in urban attacks. We also expect strong-arm tactics against FARC to increase tensions between Santos and his Venezuelan counterpart, Hugo Chvez, particularly given the erosion of the latter's political support base following Venezuela's legislative elections on September 26. Peru We believe the outcome of Peru's presidential election in April 2011 is too close to call. The election is likely to be a two-horse race between Keiko Sofa Fujimori, daughter of controversial former president Alberto Fujimori, and Luis Casteeda Lossio, the current mayor of Lima, with both garnering 20% public support in polls carried out in late August 2010 . As both candidates are from the centre-right there is likely to be broad policy continuity if either is elected. However, given that polls tend to underestimate the left-wing vote in rural areas, we cannot rule out a strong showing by nationalist candidate Ollanta Humala or the newly formed Alliance for an Alternative for Humanity party, which represents indigenous groups. Cartel Wars We expect a continuation of the violence from the cartel wars in Mexico, Central America and Colombia, as governments turn up the heat on drug traffickers. While more pan-regional cooperation, such as the recent success of military intelligence sharing between Mexica, Costa Rica and Colombia, looks likely, we do not expect to see significant headway in breaking the power of the cartels. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Latin America: More Of The Same United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Germany The German political landscape is changing as the popularity of the traditionally dominant Volksparteien continues to slide. This is bad news for the embattled centre-right coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel, with coalition infighting between the Christian Democrats , and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU, and the Free Democrats weighing heavily on approval ratings. In the meantime, the Green opposition party is enjoying record public support, indicating that a red-green coalition with the Social Democrats would win a parliamentary majority if elections were held soon. While Merkel's coalition seems to be holding together for now, with the new government having agreed to a controversial energy reform that extends the lifespan of nuclear reactors by an average 12 years, previous coalition infighting and unpopular energy reforms continue to boost the opposition. A key test will be a wave of local elections in 2011, starting with the south western state of Baden-Wrttemberg, the third most populous and a traditional stronghold of the CDU. The centre-right coalition will be keen to avoid a repeat of its performance in the most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where it lost its majority in May 2010. Italy The decision by Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, to break away from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's ruling People of Freedom party in July 2010 has significantly altered political dynamics. Fini took 33 defectors with him to form a rival group in parliament , following long-standing criticism of the prime minister's leadership. Although Fini's bloc supported Berlusconi in a no-confidence vote on September 29, it is clear that they command significant influence in parliament should they decide to vote with the opposition. As such, with the Berlusconi-Fini dispute unlikely to be resolved soon, there is a growing likelihood that Berlusconi will have to call an early election, possibly in spring 2011. Even if he prevails, he is likely to be in a weaker position. United Kingdom So far, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition appears to be working well, reflecting both parties' focus on trimming the fiscal deficit. The likelihood of protests and national strikes will increase, but the fallout will be fairly limited, given the lower degree of private sector unionisation and relatively more subdued workforce compared to Greece at the other end of the spectrum. The main risk is coalition stability, and the first key electoral test will be the May 2011 local elections. Up for re-election are the devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Although no major gains are expected for either the Conservatives or Lib Dems, a poor showing could increase coalition jitters, as could losses in the English local council elections on the same day. The English seats were last up for election in 2007, when Labour's local government fortunes were at their nadir, so we expect major Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 Western Europe United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 opposition gains simply as a result of base effects, but this is likely to be portrayed by the Labour opposition as a significant defeat for the government. Ireland The country's economic woes are taking a toll on the ruling coalition, made up of Fianna Fail and the Green Party. While societal solidarity is preventing widespread unrest, the government is deeply unpopular due to the steep budget cuts it has been forced to make. We fully expect Fine Gael and the Labour Party to form the next government, given their healthy poll readings and the fact that Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore categorically ruled out any coalition deal with Fianna Fail on July 21. Such an outcome would be the first time Fine Gael has played a part in forming an Irish government since 1982. Hungary The centre-right Fidesz party won a supermajority in recent elections, boding well for broad political stability and the policymaking process. However, the government has since spurned talks with the IMF and EU over renewal of an external financing arrangement, and this has harmed investors' confidence in the economy. The economic challenges remain huge and support for the administration could falter as the impact of austerity measures and household deleveraging continues to weigh on the economy. Czech Republic Centre-right parties won a clear majority in the 2010 general election, with the electorate handing 118 seats out of the 200 seat lower house of parliament to the Civic Democrats, Public Affairs and the newly formed TOP 09 party. We believe the centre-right coalition formed by these three parties will result in a period of stability in Czech politics, with their sizeable majority likely to ensure effective policy enactment, in particular all parties share a commitment to fiscal retrenchment. Poland The July 4 election of President Bronislaw Komorowski was a positive development for Poland's political and economic outlook. While late president Lech Kaczynski was often a roadblock to the legislative agenda of the Civic Platform -led coalition government, the presidency of Komorowski, who hails from the PO, provides an opportunity for Prime Minister Donald Tusk to deliver on his privatisation and budget consolidation plans. That said, we expect the government to move cautiously on the implementation of reforms, as it will seek to maintain electoral support in the run-up to 2010's local elections and the November 2011 parliamentary elections. Romania The government is implementing a severe package of fiscal austerity in order to correct a substantial Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Central Europe South Eastern Europe United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 imbalance in its budgetary position resulting from the global financial crisis. Although the worst of Romania's deep recession is no doubt behind us, we expect further weakness in the economy in the near term. This is posing a significant challenge to the governing coalition, which rules on a wafer-thin majority and continues to face widespread public unrest. Romania has seen multiple strikes and protests against austerity throughout 2010, with the government becoming deeply unpopular after it implemented harsh tax hikes and swingeing public sector cuts. Turkey The landmark victory for the ruling Justice and Development Party in the September 2010 constitutional referendum paves the way for what increasingly looks like a comfortable parliamentary election victory in July 2011. This is set to be complemented with a newly written constitution, the first since the 1982 constitution introduced after the last military coup in 1980. The major reforms will significantly distance the country's legislature and judiciary from any military intervention or influence and make it more difficult for political parties to be barred from politics, a fate the AKP itself only narrowly avoided in 2008. Most notably, Turkish politics is characterised by the extremely poor performance of the secularist opposition Republican People's Party , which has until now refused to engage in a bipartisan dialogue on broader constitutional reforms and improving civil liberties. As long as mutual suspicions between secularists and Islamists persist, we believe the political landscape will remain highly polarised. Furthermore, the strength of the AKP means Turkish politics will increasingly be characterised by what many critics perceive as one-party rule. Russia The government should remain broadly stable over the coming year, as Russia prepares to hold parliamentary elections in December 2011. We expect the United Russia party to retain its strong majority in the Duma. The big political unknown is whether President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will both contest the presidency in March 2012. Neither of the two have ruled this out, meaning there could be increased jockeying between their two camps. Any sign of public disagreement between the two leaders could heighten uncertainty for investors. The key risk is that Medvedev and Putin could come into serious public disagreement in 2011, potentially leading to the creation of two formal camps. This would raise the spectre of policy deadlock, which would hurt investor confidence. Beyond the inner workings of Moscow, we expect the Kremlin to continue its purge of long-serving regional leaders, which claimed several high-profile figures in 2010. On the security front, we are concerned about the high level of violence in the North Caucasus. Despite considerable federal subsidies to improve local economies, repressive security measures, and the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Russia And The Former Soviet Union United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 elimination of key militant operatives, Kremlin-appointed regional leaders have failed to rein in the insurgency. The main hotspots will remain Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan. However, other republics are coming under strain. A suicide bombing in the predominantly Christian republic of North Ossetia-Alania on September 9 threatens to increase long-standing tensions between the Ossetians and the Ingush. There have also been tensions in the republics of Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia, where the Circassian people have been making renewed calls to create a common republic. Any attempt by the Circassians to reorganise local borders could be highly destabilising, given the diverse population of the Caucasus, and is unlikely to be tolerated. The Circassians are also seeking an international boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, noting that that year marks the 150th anniversary of their 'genocide' at Russia's hands. Overall, we see no let up to the troubles in the region. Kyrgyzstan With parliamentary elections due on October 10, we believe the likelihood of residual ethnic tensions causing further violence remains high, particularly as political parties and society groups vie for representation. Beyond this, the outlook will also be defined by severe political challenges as the government attempts to manage Kyrgyzstan's shaky transition to parliamentary democracy. Furthermore, all political players will be jockeying for influence ahead of presidential elections to be held in late 2011. Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's political adviser was quoted in mid-September as saying that Nazarbayev intends to remain head of state until at least 2020, and that he foresaw no serious rivals in the 2012 elections or internal threats to the system. Given that Nazarbayev is 70 years old, speculation about his eventual succession will likely increase as the 2012 election approaches. Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration will probably face lingering protests, but these do not appear to have the numbers or breadth of appeal to unseat him. A bigger political risk is internal divisions within the regime. Three prominent politicians, namely parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, senior legislator Ahmad Tavakoli, and former Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezai, are all reportedly working to undermine Ahmadinejad in the eyes of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, possibly with a view to forcing his impeachment before his term ends in 2013. A key figure targeted in this power struggle is Ahmadinejad's chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim-Mashai, who is also considered a divisive figure due to controversial remarks he has made about religion. In the event Ahmadinejad is ousted, a possible successor is Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, who would be more acceptable to most factions. Power struggles aside, Iran's economy will remain structurally weak. Tighter sanctions, and their enforcement by key trade partners, the UAE in particular, will be problematic, and a drop in oil prices could have a very severe impact on political stability. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 25 Middle East: Mostly The Same Old Challenges United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Lebanon The political class is nervously awaiting the results of a UN-backed tribunal investigating the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. The Special Tribunal is due to announce its verdict later in 2011 or early 2011. Many expect it to blame Shi'a militant group Hizbullah, or at least some of its members. For its part, Hizbullah has denied complicity and has accused the tribunal of being compromised by false testimonies and manipulation by Israeli agents. Hizbullah remains the strongest force in Lebanon and has ministers in the national unity government. Any implication that Hizbullah was involved in the assassination could cause Prime Minister Saad Hariri's government to break apart and even trigger a flare-up in violence between Sunnis and Shi'as in Lebanon. We expect external players such as Saudi Arabia and Syria to continue working to keep a lid on any violence. However, their ability to control events may be limited, especially on the ground. Therefore, our outlook for Lebanon's political scene over the coming year is negative. In the event of an Israeli military strike on Iran, Hizbullah, which is Tehran's proxy in Lebanon, would likely retaliate by firing rockets into northern Israel. This would likely draw a military response from Israel, and a replay of the 2006 war between the two antagonists could take place. Complicating matters, Hizbullah has been at the forefront of a Lebanese campaign to claim ownership of gas reserves off the coast of Lebanon and Gaza. The reserves were discovered by a joint Israeli-US consortium and could contain up to US$40bn-worth of energy. Overall, given that Hizbullah is believed to be more heavily armed than it was in 2006, and that Israel would want to make up for the 'defeat' it suffered last time, a new conflict could be considerably more destructive and deadly this time. The above scenario could well play out even without the catalyst of an Israeli strike on Iran. Iraq As of late September 2010, six months after parliamentary elections, a new Iraqi government had still not been formed. In spite of Ayad Allawi's secular opposition bloc, Iraqiya, inching ahead of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition in the final tally, a deadlock has prevailed over the next government's composition. It is unclear when a new administration will be formed, but Iraq can ill afford a political vacuum at a time when the insurgency seems to be picking up and the US has formally ended combat operations. The Obama administration is committed to withdrawing the remaining 50,000 US troops from Iraq by the end of 2011, but the Iraqi armed forces chief has warned that the country's security forces are not ready to maintain security and that a US military presence is needed for a further 10 years. Given Iraq's precarious political and security situation, we believe the Obama administration will be forced to extend the US military presence in Iraq well beyond 2011. If Obama removes troops on schedule and Iraq subsequently descends into chaos, the political costs of withdrawal could exceed the costs of keeping troops there for longer. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 26 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Egypt One of the biggest uncertainties in the region stems from the possibility that the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, 82, may die before a successor is chosen. Although his son Gamal has long been seen as heir-apparent, the transition is far from assured, and in the event of Mubarak senior's passing, it is quite possible that the head of the intelligence services, Omar Suleiman, could become president. These contenders may not have to wait for Hosni Mubarak's death, if he does not to seek re-election when his term expires in 2011. A wild card event would be a victory for former International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohammed ElBaradei, although this would require constitutional reform to allow independents to run and a lifting of the 30-year-old state of emergency. Achieving these goals would in turn depend on substantial pressure either from the Egyptian public or the international community, or both. In the meantime, we expect the ruling National Democratic Party to win a resounding majority in lower house elections in November 2010. The real question is the extent to which the banned opposition Muslim Brotherhood will be allowed to field candidates. If it does manage to participate , we would expect the Brotherhood to win a large share of the public vote, as was the case in 2005. However, given the tensions surrounding the presidential polls, the National Democratic Party will be keen to shore up its own position, making any major efforts towards political liberalisation highly unlikely. Yemen The government will continue to face threats from the local al-Qaeda franchise, Shi'a Houthi rebels in the north and secessionists in the south. Although the Western powers plus Saudi Arabia, Russia and China all support the government in Sana'a, they are unlikely to deploy troops there, unless there is a complete collapse of the state. While this does not appear imminent, Yemen's long-term future is clouded by the declining oil reserves, high fiscal deficits, a rapidly expanding population and growing water shortages. The coming 12 months look set to be a volatile political period for Sub-Saharan Africa. Several definitive elections will take place, opening new chapters in national history. The outlook is broadly uncertain: in some cases the polls may prove a crucial step towards democratic norms; in other cases we cannot rule out a deterioration in stability and potential outbreaks of violent unrest. Nigeria The upcoming presidential election in Nigeria will be a test of democratic structures. The risks are tangible, as signalled by the sell-off across asset markets taking place at the time of writing. Yet we believe fears of instability are somewhat overdstated. Our core scenario is for incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan to win the ticket at the People's Democratic Party primaries , making him an almost certain victor at the presidential elections (tentatively scheduled for Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Sub-Saharan Africa: Definitive Elections Pending United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 April 2011). Playing into this scenario is our expectation that the opposition will not be able to unite behind a single candidate. We expect a degree of bandwagoning over the coming months as the northern governors realise a Jonathan victory is increasingly likely. One key risk to our outlook is that the North will not accept Jonathan's win, provoking a wave of ethnic violence in Nigeria's 'middle belt'. A second key risk is that Jonathan loses the elections when it is perceived by his home Bayelsa state that he should have won. Under that scenario, we would expect an uptick in violence in the Niger Delta, where Bayelsa is located. Cte d'Ivoire After five years of delays, elections in Cte d'Ivoire appear to be closer than ever. Two major obstacles have seemingly been overcome in recent times: all presidential candidates agreed on and accepted a voters' roll published by the electoral commission in September, while the Forces Nouvelles announced that former rebels had temporarily disarmed and returned to their barracks ahead of the August 31 deadline. Furthermore, there are reports that all three presidential candidates, President Laurent Gbagbo in particular, are firmly in campaign mode. Logistical challenges might mean the latest date set for the election will be missed, but we maintain our view that elections will be held before the end of 2010. Sudan Sudan is approaching an important crossroads in its history, with the semi-autonomous region of South Sudan scheduled to vote in a secession referendum on January 9 2011. Developments in the run-up to the vote have not instilled a great deal of hope that it will pass off smoothly. The relationship between the ruling, northern-dominated National Congress Party and the southern Sudan People's Liberation Movement is as strained as it has ever been since the peace agreement was signed in 2005. Many fundamental issues have yet to be resolved, such as agreement on where the border between the newly formed states will be located. Furthermore, tensions have risen between different factions within South Sudan, with some claiming the NCP is stoking these in order to derail the secession process. Our core scenario is for the South to vote to secede, given the strong local preference for independence. China's Assertiveness China has become increasingly assertive in Asia in recent months, especially with regard to its maritime claims, namely the entirety of the South China Sea and waters in the East China Sea disputed with Japan. Beijing's assertiveness has led to tensions with its neighbours and also the US. For its part, the US is seeking to 'deal' itself back into South East Asian geopolitics, much to China's disapproval. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Asia: Accommodating A More Powerful China United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Geopolitical disagreements are threatening to spill over into the economic realm. Of particular noteworthiness was China's dispute with Japan in September over Tokyo's detention of a Chinese captain whose fishing vessel had collided with two Japanese patrol boats in the East China Sea. Japan freed the captain shortly afterwards, but only after China suspended ministerial-level ties, reduced shipments of rare earth metals to Japan, and detained four Japanese nationals. Tokyo's swift capitulation shows that China holds the aces in bilateral relations, especially since it is now Japan's top trade partner. In addition, Japan's internal political weaknesses, with Prime Minister Naoto Kan facing a leadership challenge in mid-September, undermine its bargaining power with other states. However, China's assertiveness carries risks, for it could heighten suspicion towards Beijing in the region and drive countries such as Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, all of which are trying to balance relations between China and the US, further into Washington's embrace. This is not in China's perceived interests. Thus, we will continue to watch these disputes for signs that they are altering regional political configurations. Myanmar The government plans to hold its first elections since 1990 on November 7 2010, but these are highly unlikely to be free and fair. We see a risk of renewed violence as citizens vent their dissatisfaction with the ruling State Peace and Development Council junta, which will be represented by the Union Solidarity and Development Party. At this stage, it is difficult to predict the precise outcome, but the opposition may conceivably attempt to oust the regime through an 'orange'-style revolution, if the results are so blatantly manipulated. Beyond the election, attention will turn to the future of SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, who is 77 years old. Jockeying to succeed him could create new schisms within the regime. Vietnam The ruling Communist Party of Vietnam will hold its five-yearly congress in January 2011, and political maneuvering for high positions is already under way. Many senior party officials, including General Secretary Nong Duc Manh and other Politburo members, are expected to retire, paving the way for a new generation of leaders. A key question is whether Vietnam will retain its practice of maintaining a balance between the north, south and central regions when making appointments. While we expect Vietnam to retain its overall reformist economic trajectory, we believe issues such as a lack of political transparency and high levels of corruption will continue to concern investors. Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in September 2010 that an early election in 2011 is possible if the political situation continues to stabilise. With emergency rule still in place in Bangkok and six other provinces, Abhisit is pushing for the law to be gradually lifted before calling elections in 2011. However, recurring anti-government attacks have yet to subside and we are concerned that the frequency and scale of such attacks could intensify. With both sides of the Red-Yellow political divide in a close fight to win Business Monitor International Ltd Page 29 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 the next general election, uncertainty as to how the losing party will react after the vote remains a key risk in the longer term. India Six of India's 28 states will hold elections over the coming year, meaning the Congress Party-led federal government will feel under pressure to ensure that voters support it at the state level. This could prompt the party to go slow on certain economic reforms, for fear of creating a backlash. The six states are Bihar , Jharkhand , Assam , Kerala , Tamil Nadu and West Bengal . Good performances would boost Congress' standing, but the results will not necessarily provide clues as to the next general elections, which are not due until 2014. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari is again under pressure amid attempts to prosecute him for alleged corruption. On September 27, the Supreme Court postponed for two weeks a case on stripping him of presidential immunity, but a confrontation appears to be looming. Although Zardari is largely a figurehead, he draws his strength from his co-chairmanship of the Pakistan People's Party . Zardari was already vulnerable on a number of fronts, including his poor handling of the recent floods, and any new political confrontation, which could include a no-confidence motion in the government, would hurt donor and investor confidence in the country. However, an outright military coup does not appear likely, if only because taking over Pakistan in its current state would be akin to inheriting a poisoned chalice. As we stated in our previous Global Political Outlooks, 'surprises' are by definition difficult to predict. However, there are many 'known unknowns' out there. Examples include: A New Islamist Terror Attack In A Major City The risk of this was evident from the foiled Christmas Day 2009 plot to destroy an airliner over Detroit, a subsequent plot to bomb New York's Times Square, and yet another plot to carry out co-ordinated attacks in the UK, France and Germany . A successful attack would put the global 'war on terror' firmly back on the international agenda, although it is unclear who would be the target of any retaliation. Any new attack at this uncertain economic period could undermine public confidence. A New Crisis Between India And Pakistan We are concerned that Pakistan-based Islamist militants might carry out a new act of terror in India, which would force New Delhi to turn up the heat on Islamabad. The disputed territory of Kashmir saw renewed unrest in mid-2010, and the issue refuses to go away. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Wild Cards United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Sudden Deaths Of Ageing Leaders Many heads of state are in their late 70s or 80s and in several cases their successors will lack the authority of the incumbents. There is plenty of scope for succession struggles. Sudden Regime Collapse Several regimes could face major tests in 2010-2011. Although Iran, Myanmar, North Korea and Zimbabwe do not appear on the brink of imminent collapse, political change can happen surprisingly quickly once cracks appear in regimes. 'Cultural' Incidents Cultural sensitivity remains a major political issue. Even seemingly obscure events such as a Danish newspaper publishing anti-Islamic cartoons, an American pastor threatening to burn the Koran, or disputes between countries over their histories can raise political temperatures surprisingly quickly, and seemingly out of the blue. A New Global Pandemic The past decade has seen SARS, bird flu and swine flu. Although deaths have been relatively contained, new viruses that mutate and become deadlier could emerge. Natural And Environmental Disasters Any disaster affecting agricultural land, such as the mid-2010 forest fires in Russia and floods in Pakistan, will have political implications by temporarily driving up food prices. More broadly, while disasters are impossible to predict, their destructiveness will depend to some degree on the government's response. Responses perceived as incompetent can have severe political consequences. So too can incidents such as BP's oil spillage in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Cyber-Warfare Cyber-attacks are increasingly perceived as security threats. The occurrence of computer viruses at Iran's new Bushehr nuclear power plant in September is widely believed to be the result of a cyber attack, apparently the first to target industrial controls systems. Overall, we believe cyber-warfare remains one of the riskiest yet least discussed threats to security. Many of the above have been anticipated for some time, but are still likely to catch observers and investors by surprise if they happen. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Cyber Warfare: Rising Risks And Implications We believe that cyber warfare poses a rising risk to global political and economic stability and could represent a wild card in any major international confrontation. We expect the world's major powers - and indeed, smaller states - to step up their cyber warfare capabilities over the coming years, with a view to deterring others from attacking them. While any major attack on the global financial system would most likely hurt the offending nation, there is a risk that terrorists could eventually strike with cyber weapons. Given the risks involved, we expect the major powers to seek to set new rules for cyber warfare in order to prevent future geopolitical crises from getting out of hand. Cyber warfare poses a growing risk to global security and international business, and is likely to rise up the policy agenda over the coming years, as politicians, defence planners, and company leaders become more aware of the problem. Cyber warfare represents a wild card on the international state, since it could allow 'lesser' powers - or even criminal or terrorist groups - to level the playing field against the US in any future geopolitical crisis. Former US counter-terrorism adviser Richard Clarke, in his book Cyber War , defines the term to mean 'actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption'. The notion of cyber warfare has been around for many years now, mainly in the realm of science fiction (the films War Games and Independence Day and the pilot episode of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica series all depict the use of hacking or computer viruses in military computer systems), yet has been relatively neglected in the public policy debate compared to international terrorism, renewed Great Power rivalry, and global climate change. However, recent years have seen several incidents of cyber attacks that have led to a greater urgency to tackle the risks. Here, we discuss cyber security with reference to state actors in times of future crises. However, cyber crime and cyber espionage are already far more prevalent than actual occurrences of cyber warfare, and remain a significant threat to global commerce and business, due to the loss of sensitive information. Cyber espionage in particular could allow emerging nations such as China to reduce the technology gap with the United States, thus giving its economy advantages that would otherwise have taken many more years to attain. Examples Of Cyber Warfare In Action One of the earliest and most dramatic examples of cyber warfare in action occurred when the Soviet Union acquired technology designed to operate its oil and gas pumping systems from a Canadian firm in the early 1980s. Unbeknown to Moscow, the software had been corrupted by the American CIA so that it malfunctioned, creating a massive build-up of pressure. The subsequent explosion, in 1982, was Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Global Security Outlook United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 reportedly the biggest non-nuclear explosion ever recorded, and it shook Soviet confidence in the desirability of acquiring Western technologies for its industries. More recently, there have been several notable cases of cyber attacks. Brazil, 2005 And 2007 Rio de Janeiro and the state of Espirito Santo both suffered major power blackouts in 2005 and 2007 respectively, which several US intelligence officials have subsequently attributed to cyber attacks. More recently, in November 2009 Rio, Sao Paulo, and much of south-eastern Brazil saw a massive blackout which the government attributed to a severe storm but which some suspect may also have been a cyber attack. Estonia, 2007 In April 2007, Estonia's government websites, newspapers, and online banking were temporarily crippled by a cyber attack apparently emanating from Russia. The attack came after Estonia decided to take down a Soviet-era statue in Tallinn, a move that was greatly resented in Russia. Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks, but Moscow denied this, albeit conceding that zealous Russian patriots may have been responsible. Syria, 2007 In September 2007, the Israeli Air Force bombed an incomplete nuclear facility in Syria. Syria's air defence system reportedly failed to detect Israeli aircraft above its skies, apparently because it had been neutralised by a cyber attack. Georgia, 2008 In August 2008, during the Russian invasion of Georgia, a wave of cyber attacks hit the latter country's media outlets, communications systems, and banking sector. South Korea, 2009 In July 2009, key government and financial websites in South Korea were hit by cyber attacks, causing them to slow down or become disabled. Although North Korea was immediately suspected, the South's National Intelligence Service did not publicly blame Pyongyang until October. Iran, 2010 In September 2010, Iranian officials stated that computers at its Bushehr nuclear plant had been affected by the 'Stuxnet' worm virus. Naturally, suspicion turned to Israel or the US as the potential culprit. Many of the above cyber attacks were DDOS attacks, that is to say, internet websites were flooded with more requests than they could respond to. This essentially paralyses the website in question. DDOS attacks are carried out using 'botnets', which are networks of computers that have been hijacked by remote users, often even without the knowledge of their owners. Although the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 above attacks were disruptive for the victim nations, they were, in many ways, just a foretaste of what could lie ahead. How Cyber Warfare Differs From Conventional Warfare There are significant differences between cyber warfare and conventional warfare that will make the former a major wild card in future international crises. First of all, Cyber war takes place at the speed of light. Conventional attacks take at the very least many minutes or even a few hours to carry out, as missiles are fired at targets or aircraft, tanks, and ships are sent into battle. The sheer velocity of cyber attacks represents a new dimension to warfare that would dramatically increase the need for immediate - and possibly risky - decision making by governments under attack. Secondly, Cyber war is truly global in scope, in the sense that any country with a computer network can attack any other country with a computer network. There is no need for delivery vehicles or weapons, mass troop deployments, or foreign bases. This essentially flattens the battlefield, allowing minor states to take on global powers. Cyber war is thus the ultimate in asymmetric warfare. Cyber attacks are also very difficult to trace with certainty, meaning that the target of retaliation would require very careful consideration. However, it would seem likely that circumstantial evidence would identify the attacker, as was the case with Russia vis--vis Estonia in 2007. Thirdly, preparations for cyber war are far less visible than for conventional war. With the latter, preparations are usually evident through a military build-up and mobilisation order, which are easily detectable. With cyber war, there are no visible signs of preparations. Rather, cyber actors make preparations through the placement of 'logic bombs' in key computer networks of enemy states. The Main Cyber Powers There are at least 20-30 countries that are recognised as major cyber powers or capable of resorting to cyber warfare. These include the US, Canada, Russia, China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Australia, Taiwan and several NATO states. Essentially, cyber warfare requires a large pool of well-trained computer operators. While it is natural to expect the world's most economically developed countries to be cyber powers, owing to the widespread use of computers and an IT-literate workforce, the inclusion of relatively low-tech countries such as Iran and especially North Korea is significant, because it demonstrates that they see a need to counter their rivals asymmetrically if need be. According to Richard Clarke, cyber war strength must be judged by three metrics: offensive capability, defensive capability, and dependence on computer networks. By his estimates, North Korea is potentially the top cyber power, for although its offensive capabilities are weak, it has strong defences and a very low dependence on computer networks . By contrast, he judges that the US has the greatest offensive capabilities, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 but very weak defences and a very high dependence on computer networks. The latter two negate the US's offensive advantages, and make it very vulnerable to a cyber attack. Besides state actors, there are concerns that terrorists or organised criminal groups could stage cyber attacks. In 2009, it was reported that Iraqi insurgents had used software available for only US$26 to hack into video imagery relayed by US drone aircraft, thus allowing them to see what the US military was seeing. This raised concerns about the ability of insurgents to disrupt drone activity in future. Nonetheless, al-Qaeda is believed to lack the capabilities and knowledge to carry out a massive cyber attack. As for criminal groups, they are more likely to resort to cyber crime rather than disrupting major economies, which, after all, could affect their economic interests too. What Would A Massive Cyber Attack Look Like? As noted, we have already seen limited cyber attacks carried out by state actors or actors believed to have state backing. However, we have yet to witness a truly catastrophic mega-scale cyber-attack by a determined foe. A massive attack would most probably be aimed at crippling three spheres: infrastructure, the military, and the financial sector. Infrastructure The targeting of infrastructure would be aimed at disrupting civilian life on the home front, presumably with the intention of causing anti-war sentiment at home. For example, in the event of a limited military confrontation between the US and China over Taiwan or the South China Sea, Beijing could launch an electronic blitz on the USA as a warning to keep out of the conflict. Massive cyber attacks could conceivably knock out electricity supplies, and by extension, water supplies, since electricity is used to pump water. Meanwhile, a crippling of computer systems could cause oil refineries and power plants to malfunction, resulting in fires, and trains and aircraft to crash, as the sudden paralysation of their traffic networks would make it increasingly difficult to co-ordinate their safe movements. Furthermore, supply chains could be crippled, preventing goods from being delivered to retailers. While most developed societies can handle the loss of electricity for hours or even days, the accompanying disruption could lead to looting or wider civil unrest, if no-one knew what was going on and if shops ran out of food. The above is a nightmare scenario, but one that cannot be precluded. Military Cyber attacks would also aim to cripple the opponent's military. Given that the US has the most networked military of all, with its aircraft, missiles, and ships in constant communication via satellite, it is considered highly vulnerable to cyber disruption. The danger is that were the US military to become paralysed during a major conflict, the leadership could interpret this as a prelude to a nuclear attack, and thus launch a pre-emptive strike against its opponent. Even a country with a less networked military, such as North Korea, would face the same dilemma if its communications were suddenly disrupted. Pyongyang could not know for sure that a sudden blackout was not merely a prelude Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 to a full-scale US or South Korean conventional attack, and could thus be forced to go on the offensive with its extensive artillery and missile batteries. Thus, a widespread cyber attack could significantly increase the risk of conflict escalation because the sudden breakdown of communications could lead to panic, leading to rash decision-making. Financial Sector Cyber attacks could also be used to cripple the opponent's financial sector. At a basic level, this could involve causing online banking systems to crash as a result of DDOS attacks, as happened in Estonia in 2007. At a bigger level, it could be aimed at crippling international electronic trading systems and wiping out or falsifying financial data, thereby causing the financial system to freeze up. A concerted attack on US financial institutions could cause a repeat of the panic that gripped global markets in late 2008. However, precisely because the main cyber powers are so dependent on the global financial system for their own prosperity, none are likely to attack it, because this would cause substantial economic pain to the offending nation. However, a country largely isolated from the financial system, such as North Korea, could see benefits in such an attack. Measures To Reduce The Risk Of Cyber Wars In order to reduce the risk of cyber wars between the major powers, Clarke and others propose establishing a series of rules governing cyber-warfare. For example, there could be international protocols in which the signatories vow not to attack civilian infrastructure or financial systems. Such agreements could involve 1) establishing a mechanism through which countries can exchange information on cyber attacks and provide assistance to other nations; 2) establishing 'no-first use' pledges by countries until after armed hostilities have broken out; 3) prohibiting the placement of logic bombs and trapdoors on civilian infrastructure; and 4) prohibiting the alteration or destruction of financial data. Under these regulations, governments would also be obliged to crack down on hackers operating in their country that are attacking another country. This is considered important, because the Russian government denied its involvement in the 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, instead blaming overzealous patriots. Nonetheless, most Estonians believe that these groups could not have done this without the Kremlin's approval. Governments also need to decide whether cyber attacks of the kind experienced by Estonia should be treated with the same severity as a conventional attack. Evidently, this was not the case in 2007, or otherwise NATO would have been obliged to come to Estonia's defence against the attacker. Governments and defence planners will increasingly need to factor cyber warfare into their military doctrines. However, just as reaching arms limitation treaties on conventional and nuclear weapons proved so time-consuming, the same is likely to be true of cyber warfare treaties. In addition, even if the perfect Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 agreements were put in place, there is no guarantee that the signatories would adhere to them at a time of international crisis. Therefore, the possibility of a major cyber attack would still be a risk. In the mean time, governments need to raise greater public awareness of the cyber threat. While much of the media coverage of cyber security in the Western world has focused on matters such as identity theft and personal fraud, and also corporate losses and technology theft, there is still little awareness among the general public of cyber warfare issues, especially compared to threats such as terrorism or inter-state wars. Greater awareness would, in turn, lead to policy debate, and thus greater efforts to act against the threat.

The overseas conflict threat is far greater than the domestic one this comes mainly from attacks by insurgents and terrorists on troops in the process of conducting the war on terror and to US interests overseas, such as military installations, embassies and US communities. The gradual handover of US forces to Iraqi authorities is being hampered by the resurgence in bomb attacks in the latter half of 2009. Conflict Risk The war in Afghanistan continues to be the main conflict engaging large numbers of US troops and resources. Despite a Taliban resurgence and continued resistance and IED attacks in the largely tribal border regions, US and UK forces have succeeded in killing several high ranking al-Qaeda leaders, reportedly including the main liquid explosives plotter, Rashid Rauf. Civilians are often caught up in US missile attacks aimed at taking out Taliban and al-Qaeda targets, which could lead to further radicalisation among Afghans. The US is seeking to exploit ideological rifts among the insurgents. US military chiefs insist greater troop numbers are needed to win the Afghan war. The Washington Post reported in September 2009 that Obama ordered an additional 17,000 US combat troops and 4,000 trainers to Afghanistan, bringing the US total to 68,000 by the end of 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 39 US Security Risk Ratings United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 IEDs pose the main threat to US troops in the Afghan theatre. Some 32 coalition troops were killed by IEDs in January and February 2009, three times more than the same period in 2008. Some 96 troops were wounded, a 146% increase from 39 in January-February 2008, according to JIEDDO. Since the December 2008 Mumbai attacks, the US regards Lashkar-e-Taiba as a serious threat, and Pakistan is likely to be Obamas biggest foreign policy challenge, as an unstable, nuclear state vulnerable to Islamist insurgency. US policy in Afghanistan is inexorably linked to Pakistan. Further economic aid as well as more border-based troops are being sent to, in Obamas words, the worlds most dangerous place, but an enduring problem is winning trust that, given past administrations foreign policies, the US will be a long-term partner. But critics say that stepping up military operations in Afghanistan will complicate matters with Pakistan, and that more international involvement is needed. Terrorism Risk As of September 2009, the threat level was set by the Department of Homeland Security at elevated. For all domestic and international flights, it is high. The risk level is set according to intelligence gathered on threats combined with assessments of the nations vulnerability. After 9/11, the Bush administration deemed the threat high enough to form a dedicated government department and complex panoply of working groups and organisations to counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, which are regarded as high risk and high effect but to many observers, low probability and warrant billions of dollars in security expenditure. While it is thought that the majority of threats arise from within the US, it is not assumed that these come from US-based elements of ethnic and religious groups affected by the countrys operations overseas. Threats may come from many other, non-jihadist sources, such as white supremacists and other extremists. In April 2009, the DHS warned that rightwing militias and individuals were a growing threat following the election of an African American president, and could include disgruntled army veterans. Obama is more of an assassination target than his predecessors and has an unprecedented level of personal protection and security. It is noteworthy that there is still no definitive and proven conclusion to the anthrax mailings, despite the FBI naming the perpetrator as a security-cleared government biologist who committed suicide in August 2008. This was the last major terrorist attack on mainland US and the danger remains that individuals and groups are infiltrating organisations for intelligence and materials to carry out terrorism, or are insider perpetrators as the anthrax attacker is suspected of being. A growing perceived threat is from second generation Somali immigrants that are feared to be increasingly radicalised and linked to the Somali-based Islamist group al-Shabaab. The tendency for al-Qaeda to home-in on failed states makes this threat substantial for the US at home and abroad. Due to the nature of terrorism it remains very difficult to predict where, when and how terrorists will strike next. The Mumbai attacks proved that terrorists can execute an apparently simplistic attack, as the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 co-author of the US Armys Counterinsurgency Field Manual, David Kilcullen, said: Mumbai marked a departure from the traditional terrorist modus operandi and had all the hallmarks of a Special Forces raid, closer to a commando raiding activity than a traditional al-Qaeda-style terrorist attack. Physical Safety Risk A rising threat comes from Mexico, where kidnappings, murders of government agents, and turf wars waged by rampant drugs gangs on Americas doorstep are spreading across the border. This is being regarded as a greater threat than the homegrown US mafia. Mexico is regarded by the Eurasia Group as in the top 10 identified global risks. There has been a noted increase in reported kidnappings and burglaries in Phoenix, Arizona, which have links with Mexican drug cartels. Mexican border cities have seen a doubling in the murder rate since 2007. The situation is exacerbated by US weapons flowing south of the border into the hands of drug gangs. Senator Joe Lieberman, speaking to Fox News in April 2009, said Mexican drug gangs have infiltrated 230 US metropolitan areas. According to the National Drug Threat Assessment produced every year by the National Drug Intelligence Center , the main areas of infiltration by Mexican heroin traffickers are the north eastern cities. Other than attempts to strengthen border controls, the US has been supplying the Mexican government with US$400mn in drug-crime related assistance since 2007. Criminal gangs, involved in gang warfare, drugs and weapons trafficking, commit a very high proportion of crime in many towns and cities. Gang activity is becoming increasingly suburban an alarming development and made worse by areas blighted by foreclosures of homes. Domestic production of methamphetamine is to overtake 2007 levels. BMIs City Terrorism Rating covers 170 cities. It incorporates our analysts qualitative view of the terrorist threat in a state-led approach, as well as secondary analysis of data on global terrorist incidents from the US State Departments Worldwide Incidents Tracking System , to provide a quantitative assessment of the risks. Due to the use of State Department data, the definition of terrorist incidents refers to incidents in which sub-national or clandestine groups or individuals deliberately or recklessly attacked civilians or non-combatants. All incidents have been either claimed, or inferred as being perpetrated, by groups designated as terrorists. To offer a cross-country comparison of the terrorist threat, the CTR accommodates the qualitative difference between the terrorism threat across states, which, broadly-speaking, can be grouped as follows: type A state: endemic terrorist threat; and type B state: unpredictable terrorist threat.

BMIs City Terrorism Rating assesses the risk of a terrorist attack. The State rating has a 25% weighting and is our overall Terrorism Rating for the state. The Prevalence sub-rating has a 25% weighting. It assesses the frequency of attacks, and whether the city is a priority target for terrorists. The Threat sub-rating has a 50% weighting. It assesses the number of victims, and is weighted by severity of attacks and the ability of groups to launch sustained campaigns, rather than one off attacks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Table: BMI Americas City Terrorism Index United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 It is important to clarify the limits of the CTR. While terrorism is popularly conflated with all challenges to the rule of law, the CTR is more narrowly focused. It specifically excludes activities of organised criminal gangs, whose strategy and tactics may be similar to terrorist groups, but whose aims are different. There are cities that have a high terrorism risk but are otherwise characterised by a comparatively strong rule of law, and vice versa. While the CTR should form part of a consideration of the risks associated with each city, it is not a snapshot of overall risks to physical safety and security. Please see the Methodology section at the end of the report for more details. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Challenges In The 2010s The 2010s look set to be another challenging decade for the US, we believe, mainly due to the aftermath of the 2007-2009 recession and the ongoing war in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, two of the main megatrends in US politics will be the continuing rise of the south-western states and Hispanic-Americans as key forces. The 2010s look set to be another challenging decade for the US, as it grapples with the aftermath of the 2007-2009 recession. On the domestic front, unemployment is at a 26-year high of almost 10%, the budget deficit is at a record high in percentage and absolute terms, and government involvement in the economy is at its greatest in many years. On the external front, the US is fighting an ongoing war in Afghanistan and there is a general sense that America is slowly being eclipsed by China. That said, we caution against taking an overly pessimistic assessment of the US, which has since the 1960s repeatedly and prematurely been described as being in decline, only to resurge later. Nonetheless, neither the Obama administration nor any putative successor can expect a comfortable ride. Challenges And Threats To Governance And Stability The US faces a number of challenges, some chronic, some new, which will complicate governance: Frequency Of Elections The US holds presidential elections every four years, but campaigning for them usually begins a year in advance. This, coupled with mid-term Congressional elections, means that considerable political capital is diverted to campaigning rather than governance. The incumbent president and Congress thus have only a limited time to implement their agendas. Moreover, if the opposition wins Congress at the mid-term polls, they can cause gridlock for the White House. Rising Inequalities Socio-economic inequalities are rising in the US. The families' gini coefficient stood at 0in 2008, up from 0in 1978. Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence suggests that social mobility has decreased, with the wealthy increasingly entrenched, and those at the bottom of the spectrum having fewer opportunities for economic advancement. This could heighten resentment and lead to greater populism in future election campaigns. High Unemployment, Deficits And Debt Unemployment is at a 26-year high of almost 10%, and although this should ease as the economy recovers, we expect joblessness to remain structurally high in the years ahead. Meanwhile, the US will have to take bold measures to cut back the budget deficit and debt burden at a time when the 'baby Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Political Overview Domestic Political Outlook United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 boomers' are retiring . Many of these cuts will have to take place at state level, since the Federal government cannot afford to bail out quasi-bankrupt states such as California. Polarised Electorate The last three presidential elections have shown an electorate highly divided between the Democrats and Republicans, with defeated Republican candidate John McCain still taking an impressive 47% of the vote in 2008 to Obama's 52%. Geographically, there is a noteworthy division between consistently 'blue' states and 'red' states, although there are important swing states that ensure elections do not result in a deadlock, or award power exclusively to one party. Secular Versus Religious Divide The US population remains divided between those who favour a more overtly religious society and those who favour a more secular one, with the Republicans having prevailed in winning the support of evangelical Christians. That said, Republican support for 'evangelical' causes was limited under George W. Bush, and there are no serious attempts to formally bring the church and state closer together. The 'War on Terror' The US has, since the late 1990s, been in a quasi-permanent state of war, first in the Balkans and a low-level air campaign in Iraq, and subsequently on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq under the 'War on Terror'. The foiled Christmas Day 2009 Detroit terror plot demonstrates that terrorism remains a major risk for the US. The US's external commitments mean that considerable political capital and federal funds must be devoted to national security, sometimes at the expense of domestic social and economic matters. Despite these challenges, our long-term political risk rating for the US is high at 81. The country scores 93for 'characteristics of polity', reflecting its strong democratic foundations and system of government, and 80for 'characteristics of society'. The 'policy continuity' score is high at 80, as successive US administrations have broadly maintained fairly similar policies. Scenarios For Political Change Over the coming decade, we foresee the following trends in US politics: Rising South And West The 2010 US Census is expected to reallocate more congressional seats to southern and western states, at the expense of the north. The main beneficiaries are likely to be Texas, Florida, Arizona, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Utah, Nevada, and Oregon. This reflects rising populations in the south and west due to migration, and confirms the regions' growing political influence. Although southern states traditionally favour the Republicans, this cannot be taken for granted, as many migrants will hail from traditionally Democrat states. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Rising Importance Of Hispanics Hispanic-Americans constitute a rising proportion of the US population, having increased from 9% in 1990 to a projected 15% in 2010 and 17% in 2020. The population will keep expanding to around 25% by 2050. This reflects immigration and higher birth rates, and they are now a major electoral block courted by both parties. At present, Hispanics tend to vote for the Democrats, but this could change as rising incomes and their social values eventually align them with the Republicans. By 2020, we would expect to see a Hispanic person on the presidential ticket. Identity Politics As Hispanic-Americans become a bigger share of the US population, and as Asian-Americans rise in prominence, the US's traditional Anglo-Saxon identity will be further eroded. This is already leading to a backlash against immigration by Americans of European descent, especially in marginal states such as California. Mexican Drug War Spillover Mexico's drug wars have intensified in recent years, with evidence that violence is spilling over into the US. This could inevitably push border security issues up the political agenda, and could lead to a strain on relations with Mexico. Greater Regionalism Already, a significant proportion of western US trade is directed towards Asia, northern US trade towards Canada, and southern US trade towards Mexico and Latin America. Over a long period of time beyond our 10-year forecast period we would expect these economic patterns to lead to greater regionalism in the US that could exert conflicting forces on Washington politics. Climate Change Climate change is likely to rise in importance if the US experiences more Hurricane Katrina-style natural disasters or severe droughts in the more arid states. Over the longer term, this could check the growth of western and southern states. Possible Third Party Formation US third parties have traditionally been weak, and have seldom made an impact on national politics. However, if neither the Democrats nor Republicans make significant headway in tackling America's woes, we would expect a renewed attempt to build a third force in the 2010s. Wild Cards: Terrorism And Defeat In Afghanistan There are two major wild cards for our long-term political outlook. The first is a new 9/11-scale terror attack in the US. This would raise the importance of domestic security above virtually all other issues, and lead to new anti-terror measures that would trigger vehement opposition from civil liberties groups and lead to claims that the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 US is becoming an authoritarian state. The future of the US political system would then become contested. The second wild card is a perceived US defeat in Afghanistan. The Obama administration has raised American troop strength in Afghanistan to 100,000, but even this may not be enough to defeat the Taliban insurgency. Consequently, Obama may have to commit even more troops at a later date to 'finish the job', or give up and go for a full withdrawal after empowering the Afghan National Army to its best abilities. The latter outcome could lead to perceptions of defeat, greatly undermining US confidence and prestige on the world stage, and potentially leading to a period of national introspection and malaise, not unlike the post-Vietnam period of 1975-1980. However, this would probably set the scene for a US resurgence under a new president in 2016 or 2020. Obama And The Limits Of US Power We believe that US foreign policy objectives are likely to face deadlock, as the country moves into 2011. The experiences of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have demonstrated the limits of American power, and this has emboldened countries such as Iran, North Korea, and China in their dealings with the US. As 2011 approaches, the US economy will be experiencing a renewed slowdown, suggesting that domestic economic issues will remain the main focus of President Barack Obama and the American public. At the same time, the US' ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are severely straining Washington's political will and military flexibility, raising questions about America's ability to go to war against Iran. The US' war-weariness and a general sense of exhaustion will in turn embolden its main enemies such as Iran and North Korea, and main rivals, namely China. Iraq: US Troop Pull-Out Likely To Be Delayed The US officially ended combat operations in Iraq at the end of August 2010, by which time it had reduced its troop presence there to 50,000 from a peak of 170,000 in 2007. After September 1 2010, the US military formally assumed an advisory role, training and supporting Iraq's army and police. Beyond this, the remaining 50,000 troops are scheduled to be completely withdrawn by the end of 2011. However, there are growing concerns in Washington and Baghdad that Iraqi security forces are not sufficiently strong to maintain order. In August, Iraqi armed forces chief of staff Lt-Gen Babakar Zebari publicly stated that the military would not be ready to ensure security until at least 2020. In particular, he said that the real problems would start after 2011, by which time Iraq would theoretically be devoid of US troops. Zebari's views are believed to be shared by Iraqi and American generals. Our belief is that the US will indeed extend its military presence and keep substantial numbers of troops although not necessarily 50,000 in Iraq well beyond 2011. This would be politically unpopular, but the costs of exiting Iraq and leaving behind renewed chaos would arguably be even higher. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 47 Long-Term Political Outlook United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Afghan War Heading For Stalemate As a result of the US troop surge in Afghanistan and the concomitant reduction from Iraq, the former country is now the US' main military theatre, with Washington contributing 100,000 troops out of the 150,000 Western soldiers deployed there. This force now exceeds the Soviet Union's peak of 120,000 troops during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, which ended in defeat. Nonetheless, Afghanistan's population has doubled since then, and the US and its allies have found themselves unable to defeat the Taliban insurgency and allow the pro-Western government in Kabul to consolidate its control over the country. Meanwhile, the US has become frustrated with the high level of corruption in Afghanistan, which arguably fuels the insurgency by undermining the effectiveness of government. The US strategy is to train up the Afghan National Army sufficiently so that the latter can maintain security. However, while the ANA now numbers 130,000, its effectiveness is undermined by high illiteracy among recruits, and high levels of desertions. Meanwhile, the fact that Obama is on record as stating he wants to start withdrawing troops from July 2011 has arguably emboldened the Taliban, which probably believes that it can outlast American willpower to stay the course. Overall, we believe that the US will be forced to delay any substantial troop withdrawals, lest this be portrayed as a defeat. Beyond 2011, the Afghan war appears to be headed for an extended stalemate, which in time could result in a de facto partition of the country between a pro-Western north and a Taliban-controlled south. While no incumbent US official is advocating this, the idea could gain support if the present deadlock prevails. Iran: US Attack Still Unlikely Iran's nuclear programme will remain a key priority for the US. Although we expect rumours of an impending US/Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities to pervade the international media from time to time, we still believe that an actual strike is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Although a US attack would differ from the Afghan and Iraq wars in that it would consist largely of an intensive bombing campaign rather than a ground invasion and occupation, its consequences would still be substantial. Iranian retaliation would be expected, most probably via proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Afghanistan, in the Strait of Hormuz, and possibly far beyond the region. In addition, the air campaign could not be guaranteed success. Thus, Washington will instead hope that tighter sanctions on Iran will strangle its economy, thereby turning up the internal pressure on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with a view to forcing his replacement by a more compromising figure, or at least moderating his behaviour. Even if Ahmadinejad were replaced, though, we believe that Tehran will retain its nuclear programme. North Korea: Denuclearisation A Non-Issue The Korean Peninsula will remain a potential flashpoint, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Il grooms his third son Kim Jong Un to succeed him. Kim Jong Un was appointed a four-star general in September and needs the backing of the military to assume power. This means that Pyongyang will be prone to Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 potentially provocative behaviour, such as more naval skirmishes, missile tests, or even a third nuclear test, as Jong Un seeks to prove his credentials. Owing to North Korea's substantial military , artillery forces, and weapons of mass destruction, a US strike on the country is virtually unthinkable. Tighter sanctions have been introduced, but China continues to support Pyongyang. Overall, even if the 'Six-Way' talks over North Korea's nuclear programme are resumed, we do not expect Pyongyang to make any meaningful concessions. While China's influence is undoubtedly rising, the US still has the upper hand, and we believe that it will remain the world's dominant power for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, the shift in perceptions of the US-China power balance is important and we expect Beijing to become more assertive in its dealings with Washington, potentially leading to more frictions. The state visit of Chinese President Hu Jintao to the US on January 18-21 2011 came at a time when the US is widely seen to be a declining superpower, whereas China is seen as a major power on the rise. Although the US economy is recovering, it is suffering from high unemployment, record fiscal deficits, and a rising debt burden. On the geopolitical front, the US is weary after almost a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Meanwhile, China is feeling increasingly confident, having successfully avoided an economic crisis during the global recession of 2008-2009. Beijing's growing confidence was evident in 2010, when it started reasserting its claims over disputed territory in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Furthermore, China even test flew its new J-20 prototype stealth fighter during a visit to the country by US defense secretary Robert Gates earlier in January 2011, seemingly to demonstrate its growing military prowess. US Still Has The Upper Hand Nonetheless, despite its weakened position, the US is still much more powerful globally than China and it is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. When examining global power dynamics, we look at six 'dimensions' of influence. These are 1) economic power, chiefly absolute GDP; 2) military power, especially the ability to deploy forces abroad; 3) diplomatic influence; 4) soft power, chiefly cultural appeal; 5) demographic power, chiefly absolute population size and age dynamics; and 6) willingness to act globally. The US has a commanding lead over China in all but one of the above categories, namely demographic power, where China has around four times as many people as the US. However, the US has a more favourable demographic outlook than China thanks to its higher birth rate and immigration, which is keeping its population relatively youthful. China's working age population has already peaked, and this could sap its labour force. As regards the other five measures of influence, the US economy is still much bigger than China's and will probably remain so until at least the late 2020s. Moreover, the US economy is driven by private consumption , whereas China's economy is struggling to raise Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 Foreign Policy Sino-US Relations United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 consumption from 35% of GDP. Although China's economy is not as dependent on exports as is widely believed, it still relies heavily on the US market. The US economy is also much more technologically advanced and business-friendly than China's, and this will not change any time soon. Furthermore, the US also overwhelmingly leads China on the popular culture and lifestyle appeal fronts, which make it an attractive destination for migrants and foreign talent. This in turn injects dynamism into the US economy. US Also Has Overwhelming Military Superiority From a geopolitical perspective, the military capabilities of the US and China merit considerable attention. Much has been made of the double-digit annual increases in China's defence budget, and the fact that the US is bogged down in Afghanistan . Nonetheless, the military balance is still overwhelmingly in the US' favour, and it has a truly global military presence. The US has 11 aircraft carriers, 31 amphibious ships, and bases in dozens of countries around the world, whereas China has yet to build its own carrier or open an overseas base, and has only one amphibious ship. This limits Beijing's ability to project power around the world or mount international relief operations such as the post-Asian tsunami recovery in January 2005. China has almost as many submarines as the US , but the US is much more experienced in submarine warfare. The US also has a superior air force to China, with a greater number of advanced fighter jets, 139 of which are stealth fighters. As noted, China has only just tested its prototype stealth fighter, and it is unlikely to enter service until later this decade. Furthermore, the US has overwhelming nuclear superiority over China, with 9,000 warheads compared to China's 240. China certainly recognises this military imbalance, which is why it is actively pressing ahead with developing a 'blue water' ie ocean-going navy. In particular, Beijing wants a naval force capable of securing China's principal trade routes through the South China Sea and Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf. Although China is developing an aircraft carrier, there is no discussion of matching the US' 11-strong carrier fleet, so Beijing has instead been developing missiles capable of crippling US carriers if need be. China is especially keen to avoid a repetition of the situation in March 1996, when President Bill Clinton sent two US carriers near Taiwan to deter Beijing from military provocations ahead of the island's first direct presidential election. Yet despite its efforts to boost its military strength, China must exercise a degree of caution. Beijing knows that its military build-up is causing consternation in Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and India, all of which may respond by bolstering their own armed forces, or in the case of Tokyo and New Delhi, by strengthening defence ties with Washington. Indeed, China arguably overplayed its hand in 2010 by acting too assertively with regard to its territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea, thereby creating a backlash. Chinese policymakers are aware of their country's constraints. In an essay published on January 24, Le Yucheng, director-general of policy planning at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that Beijing should not assume that the US is in irreversible decline or that the two countries will soon be equals. He Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 noted that the US comprises a quarter of the world's GDP and maintains incomparable military, scientific, and innovative strengths, and will retain unbeatable global dominance for the next 20 to 30 years. However, he added that China will not meekly submit to pressure, tolerate being bullied, or stay passive. Indeed, Chinese military leaders are becoming more outspoken, with defence minister Liang Guanglie stating in December 2010 that the People's Liberation Army will 'push forward preparations for military conflict in every strategic direction' over the next five years. Earlier last year, Senior Colonel Liu Mingfu, a professor at the National Defence University, published a book calling on China to become the world's number one global power. Liu advocated a 'military rise' to complement the country's economic rise, so that the US would not dare challenge China over Taiwan. Although Liu wrote his book in a personal capacity, his views are indicative of a growing nationalism within China. Shifting Perception Dynamics May Complicate Bilateral Relations Although the US is still far stronger geopolitically than China, perceptions may well shift faster than reality, and this will affect how Beijing and Washington approach issues of contention at bilateral meetings. The biggest American bone of contention is the dollar/yuan exchange rate, which is seen as a key cause of the US' huge trade deficit with China and the migration of American jobs across the Pacific. Other issues of concern include Chinese violation of US intellectual property rights, differences over human rights , US support for Taiwan, US sympathy for the Tibetan cause, China's support for North Korea, Myanmar, and other 'rogue' regimes, and China's rising influence in Africa and Latin America. In the past, the US has taken a highly critical tone towards China, lecturing Beijing on what it ought to do. However, as power or perceptions thereof begins to shift, Washington may at times find itself toning down its rhetoric and adopting a more restrained attitude. Perceptions of a power shift between the US and China will also affect other countries seeking to maintain a careful balance between the two giants. Herein lies the risks for policymakers. We have already seen how China misjudged its power in Asia last year, by asserting its maritime territorial claims. In addition, if the US comes to be seen as unwilling or unable to challenge Chinese dominance in Asia, other countries in the region could conclude that they are better off finding an accommodation with Beijing rather than relying indefinitely on the US as a geopolitical balancer. Factors That Could Alter The Perceptions Gap For China, a major risk is that its economy experiences a 'hard landing' due to the bursting of the property bubble or policy missteps aimed at cooling rampant growth. This would take the sheen off its economic confidence, forcing it to focus inwards during the painful readjustment process. However, the opposite could also happen. An economic crash could make China feel more vulnerable, thus leading to a more assertive attitude. Meanwhile, economic difficulties in China could embolden US policymakers by allowing them to champion the American model over Beijing's state-driven capitalist system. However, they would need to be careful not to appear patronising towards China, lest this generate more resentment on Beijing's part. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 For its part, there is a risk that the US underestimates its own strengths and experiences a psychological malaise, especially if the economy performs poorly over the next few years or the Afghan war ends in apparent stalemate, as seems likely. Another possibility is that a future US president, sensing a greater need to challenge China's rising power, will adopt a much tougher stance towards Beijing than Barack Obama. Overall, while we still believe that both countries will work diligently to manage their differences, there is a rising scope for more disagreement and misunderstanding over the coming years. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Despite predictions that a second 9/11 was in the offing, recent terrorist attacks and pre-empted plots have been sited overseas. Al-Qaeda atrocities have occurred in several countries while other incidences have had al-Qaeda connections, including several pre-empted plots. The most recent was the attempt to blow up an aircraft approaching Detroit on December 25 2009 by a suspect believed to have links to al-Qaeda who claimed his device was assembled and given to him in Yemen. On December 26, 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was charged in the US with attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines aeroplane. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled to take place in Detroit on 13 April. In January 2010, more details emerged about the attempt, including the construction of the device and the ensuing countermeasures to heighten security at US airports. The 15cm packet secreted about the suspects body contained 80g of virtually undetectable PETN, a proven, stable high-explosive, and a highly unstable peroxide-based explosive, TATP, which appears to have burnt away without causing detonation. Of note is that a classic detonation method such as a blasting cap was not chosen as it would have been detected on the airport scanners. Some US$734mn from the US$3trn budget proposed by President Obama for fiscal year 2011 is to be spent on the deployment of 1,000 new Advanced Imaging Technology screening machines at airports in the country as well as new explosive detection baggage scanners. There will also be more funding to install Federal Air Marshals on a greater number of international flights. However, there is some debate about how far body scanning will inconvenience passengers and how far personality profiling and enhanced surveillance will be successful in identifying suspects before they get airside. The threat from the section of al-Qaeda known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has increased in that failing state, already a hotbed of insurgency, with many veteran operatives leaving Afghanistan and Pakistan and entering Yemen. The increasing presence of al-Qaeda in the country may also pose a high risk of further US intervention, with Yemen as a new frontier in the war on terror. US intelligence officials say that in recent years al-Qaeda has prioritised building a base in Yemen. President Obama said after the attempted attack: We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the US homeland. However, the Obama administration is being accused by Republican opponents of downplaying the threat from al-Qaeda, including its intention to acquire WMD. The suggestion from the political right is that not enough is being done in the War on Terror. In response, Vice-President Joe Biden told NBC's talk show Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Domestic Security Overview Internal Security United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Meet the Press in February: We're pursuing that war with a vigour like it's never been seen. We've eliminated 12 of the top 20 people; we have taken out 100 of their associates. They are, in fact, not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. Obamas policy of deploying thousands more troops to Afghanistan and increasing Predator drone missile strikes on Pakistan militants is considered a key reason for the recent successes. The argument is still being had about trying terrorist suspects by military commissions, as favoured by the Republicans, rather than within the criminal justice system. The debate has heated up since the Obama administrations decision to try the alleged 9/11 head plotter, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and the underpants bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, in civilian courts. Experts in counterterrorism warn that the politicians need to keep their options open for the sake of pragmatism by making available both civilian and military processes. The civilian process may enable charges to be more variable in order to bring about defendant co-operation. However, proponents of the military system believe that foreign terrorists are enemy combatants, not common criminals. Trying such people in military-style commissions could cause problems as some countries may be reluctant to send suspects to the US without the guarantee of a civilian trial. The US government is still actually imprisoning, without trial, detainees in Guantnamo Bay and military commissions continue in some cases. Meanwhile, General Petraeus told Congress in March 2010 that although the Iranians attempts to go nuclear have been delayed, Tehran was providing al-Qaeda with a key facilitation hub, where facilitators connect al-Qaedas senior leadership to regional affiliates, as reported by the Washington Times. Although Irans ruling Shiite version of Islam is diametrically opposed to al-Qaedas Sunni extremism, US military and intelligence hold suspicions that Tehran backed al-Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks and that al-Qaeda members are traversing Iran en route to Afghanistan and Pakistan. While homegrown terrorists are rare in the US, an alarming new development was manifested in the impending trial on May 3 of an American woman, dubbed Jihad Jane only the second female US citizen to be tried domestically for terrorism. Colleen LaRose of Philadelphia is charged with taking part in a plot to assassinate a Swedish cartoonist whose work offended Muslims. LaRose is also accused of agreeing to enter a marriage of convenience with another suspected terrorist to enable him to obtain a passport, in addition to four charges of conspiring with terrorists overseas by attempts to recruit them online. Also in late March, another US citizen, a Chicago resident of Pakistani descent, pleaded guilty to the charge of scouting for targets for the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. Before the attempted attack above Detroit, the most high profile incident had been the September 2009 UK liquid explosives plot retrial, which convicted three British Muslims of plotting to blow up seven or more transatlantic aircraft en route to the US and Canada with liquid explosives hidden in soft drinks in August 2006. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 54 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Under preliminary interrogation, Abdulmutallab said his device was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used and that he made internet contact with a radical imam in Yemen who then connected him with al-Qaeda leaders in a village north of Sanaa. As a result of the Detroit incident, whole-body scanners are to be phased in at airports and security stepped up at US points of entry. But critics have said that there was insufficient communication between intelligence, law enforcement and security services and inadequate monitoring of the suspect, showing there are holes in the US security system. Before the trial in Britain had finished, when Obama took office in February 2009, the CIA warned the president that UK-based terrorists were the main threat to the US. British newspaper The Daily Telegraph said in February 2009 that up to four in every 10 CIA operations were to pre-empt attacks on the US are against targets and suspects of Pakistani origin and in Britain its main ally in the war on terror including the above plot, in which the CIA cooperated closely with MI5. Airports are still regarded as highly vulnerable targets, with airport security systems catching up with the most recent threats, not only for the hijack and blowing up of aircraft but for possible attacks within terminal buildings, including chemical attack. Although chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives detection systems are in place in many airports, there is doubt as to their effectiveness in spotting novel explosives, chemicals and small amounts of radioactive material which could be usable in radiological weapons. The FBI found that the Abdulmutallabs device, hidden in his underwear, contained more than 80g of pentaerythritol tetranitrate , a stable high-explosive and constituent of Semtex, which is difficult or impossible to detect on most on most explosives scanning equipment. Also found were the remnants of a syringe allegedly used to inject a liquid into a powder component of the device on the suspects body. Had the device detonated it would have been powerful enough to breach the body of the aircraft. PETN was also used in an internally placed device by an AQAP militant in an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Saudi Arabias head of counterterrorism, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, in August 2009. There is also heightened vigilance against laser attacks aimed at aircraft. In September 2009, five were arrested at Port Columbus airport accused of targeting an aircraft with a laser from a car. Whether by terrorists or mischief-makers this is regarded as highly dangerous. The transit systems in major cities are regarded as high-profile targets, including vast networks of underground transportation tunnels, where an explosion could close them down for years rather than months. As of September 2009, technology for monitoring is still to be installed as part of a multi-million-dollar surveillance system for the New York subway. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 55 Transit Vulnerability United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 In May 2010, Pakistani-born US citizen Faisal Shahzad was arrested for attempting to detonate an improvised bomb in Times Square, New York City. Shahzad admitted to the attempted bombing in Federal District Court in Manhattan in June 2010, where he claimed that the attack was in response to ongoing US drone bombings in Pakistan, which are intended to target al-Qaeda and Taliban militants, and that further attempts would be made by others. The drone bombings have become increasingly controversial as a favoured approach under the Obama administration, as some point out the poor tradeoff between the questionable quality of intelligence used to justify each attack and the number of civilians killed by them. The United Nations, for example, referred to the targeted killings as illegal and called for the US to end the practice in a report disclosed in June 2010. In any case, Shahzads attempted bombing was seen as especially troubling by authorities and commentators because of his relatively middle class background as well as his status as a US citizen. In May 2009, The New York Police Department and FBI pre-empted a domestic plot, hatched mainly by Islamic converts over a 12-month period, to blow up two synagogues in New York City and also to shoot down military aircraft planes at a National Guard air base in Newburgh in New York State. This has raised the domestic threat considerably from homegrown Islam-inspired terrorism. The four plotters were reported to have been radicalised during prison parole rehab. In 2007, a New York Police Department report said homegrown terrorism was a far greater threat than al-Qaeda in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan. This contradicted the 2007 national intelligence estimate. The NYPD said there was a growing threat, as in the UK, from Muslim men of 15-35 years old, including legal immigrants, with no direct links to al-Qaeda who take an extreme and minority interpretation of Islam, making it harder to track any discernible chain of command. The Radicalization In The West And The Homegrown Threat report described over 20 clusters of such men active in the north-eastern US. The internet is rife with extremist groups peddling poisonous doctrines, which in turn provides intelligence services with clues and an additional means of surveillance. Hackers and virus/trojan writers classed as cyber-terrorists are a constant and perpetual threat, and are becoming more sophisticated. It is often difficult to trace the origin of a cyber attack; it is claimed that North Korea and Russia are frequent sources of concerted cyber-terrorism. Several high-profile cases are in process, including the US demand to try a British citizen who succeeded in hacking into 97 unclassified government systems, including at the Pentagon and NASA, and whose appeal for extradition to be tried in the UK was rejected by the British High Court in July 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 56 Internal Terrorism Cyber-Terrorism United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 This danger also comes from individuals who have infiltrated organisations, or decide to threaten them from within, or just decide to cause disruption. One example was the arrest and charging on September 14 2009 of a US Department of Defense analyst working on satellite surveillance at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, who is accused of hacking into a highly secret system being used in a joint FBI-US Army terrorism investigation. It is claimed that he managed to hack in using a password from an earlier classified message he received legitimately. Pandemics A pandemic of avian and/or swine flu is regarded as a high-priority non-terrorist threat. It is questioned whether the US health service would be able to cope with a pandemic particularly from an increase in swine flu cases or biological attack. As in many other countries, the US fears that the winter 2009 flu season will see a rise in severity and incidence of H1N1 influenza with possible consequent high mortality, and overstretch of the medical services. Crime And Drugs The crime threat from Mexican drug gangs increased throughout 2009. The National Gang Assessment 2009, an intelligence report by the National Gang Intelligence Center and the National Drug Intelligence Center , said that homegrown gangs are moving to the suburbs from the inner-city areas and account for the rise in crime and violence, much of it drugs-related and including weapons trafficking. The report said there are 1mn gang members in at least 20,000 criminally active gangs in all states. Gun ownership is still enshrined in US culture as an individuals right.

Source: US Department of State, Office of Counterterrorism, Center for Defense Information, Terrorism Project, BMI Quadrennial Defense Review President Obamas first QDR was released in February 2010. In it, a serious stance change was mooted concerning a variety of force deployment issues. It was particularly suggestive of ongoing doctrinal changes concerning warfare of the kind which has been seen much more in Afghanistan and Iraq than in previous engagement and warfare scenarios. In this, it follows many other nations in redeveloping its view of the role of the military, and the manner in which governments will continue to support and fund their commitments. Again, like many other national plans, it recognises the nature of armed conflict as fundamentally different from previous situations and begins to establish what changes will need to be realised in order to maintain US military dominance, especially with the ongoing commitment to be able to be operative in two state level conflicts simultaneously. Traditionally, the role of the QDR has been to establish the outline of future procurement issues, which will then be resolved in annual budget negotiations. This has often led to a vision/reality division, in which tradeoffs are needed to be made annually. In its own words, the new QDR describes some of the tradeoffs that Defense Department leaders have identified to enable the rebalancing of US military Business Monitor International Ltd Page 59 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 capabilities, but admits that, more such tradeoffs could be necessary in the future. This becomes even truer in the light of reduced government spending, and a recent history which has seen yearly increases in the defence budget for the past 13 years. Several structural impediments have also been highlighted as problems to the kind of rebalancing called for in the QDR 2010. These include such issues as a growing retired service personnel, increased cost of mandatory programmes such as medicare, and also the inevitable rise of equipment which is to be procured . These barriers, as well as other vested impediments, present very real problems for a successful and timely reallocation of resources. A call for a whole of government approach to national security also brings potential problems to swift reforms, as inter agency co operation can often be a much drawn out process. However, the potential for long-term savings is very great if this approach firmly takes root. The FY2011 budget seeks US$549bn for the DoD base budget, which excludes war costs. This represents a nominal increase of 2% and a real increase of 1% over the FY2010 request. However, given both the context of the QDR and of more recent budget movements, it seems unlikely that the full realisation of the plans outlaid in the QDR will come to fruition, as given current commitment the DoD base budget should sit around US$567bn a year until 2028. This is significantly over current spending and it appears unlikely that this average will be reached. Iran's nuclear programme will remain a key priority for the US. Although we expect rumours of an impending US/Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities to pervade the international media from time to time, we still believe that an actual strike is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Although a US attack would differ from the Afghan and Iraq wars in that it would consist largely of an intensive bombing campaign rather than a ground invasion and occupation, its consequences would still be substantial. Iranian retaliation would be expected, most probably via proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Afghanistan, in the Strait of Hormuz, and possibly far beyond the region. In addition, the air campaign could not be a guaranteed success. Thus, Washington will instead hope that tighter sanctions on Iran will strangle its economy, thereby turning up the internal pressure on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with a view to forcing his replacement by a more compromising figure, or at least moderating his behaviour. Even if Ahmadinejad were replaced, though, we believe that Tehran will retain its nuclear programme. Iran continues to obfuscate on its uranium enrichment programme, with the revelation in late September of yet another secret plant , and heavy water project in development at Arak . While the programme is not running sufficiently to produce a nuclear weapon in the next two years, the Iranians are proceeding apace with little opposition other than the possibility of a long-heralded Israeli air strike. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 60 Iran United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 In December 2009, a secret document was obtained by The Times and the International Atomic Energy Agency that contained evidence that, not only had Iran been working on building nuclear weapons as recently as 2007, but also described efforts to research and test a component a neutron initiator which is only used for nuclear weapons. A neutron initiator is placed at the centre of a fission bomb to flood the uranium core with neutrons and initiate the chain reaction. The Obama administration continues to take a dual-track approach to Iran, which combines putting more international pressure on Iran while offering to engage them in taking part in nuclear talks. As the street protests from opposition groups increased towards the end of 2009, some observers believe that increasing sanctions against Iran would delay political changes. However, the revelation of the nuclear document which was undated, but is thought to have been produced in 2007 will bring increased sanctions closer, even possibly with the support of Russia and China. There is the heightened possibility of Israel outpacing the US by going ahead with a unilateral strike on Irans nuclear facilities in 2010. The Iranian missile programme was also stepped up, further provoking the US administration. Several tests were conducted in 2009, including the launch in December of an upgraded version of the Sajjil-2, which the Iranian Minister of Defence Ahmad Vahidi said would act as a strong deterrent against possible foreign attack. Iran said the Sajjil-2, first tested earlier in 2009, is more accurate than the Shahab missile and has a longer range: 3,200km, compared with the Shahabs 2,000km. Iran also carried out two long-range Shahab-3 missile tests in September 2009. One was solid-fuel and therefore able to be launched at short notice. Both could reach Israeli territory or US bases in the Gulf. The combination of missile testing and increased intransigence of the Iranians is leading to the US switching its testing against missile attacks from North Korea to Iran. Iran is also threatening the trade and naval interests of the US and other powers operating in the vitally strategic Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, according to a US Office of Naval Intelligence report published in November 2009 operational control of Irans official navy in those areas has been handed over to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy the Revolutionary Guard Corps naval component as such, a paramilitary naval force using insurgency tactics. If the IRGCN was to close or mine the narrow Strait of Hormuz, Iran could potentially cut off almost a third of the world's oil supply. Iran has deployed Chinese-supplied cruise missiles in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, as well as numerous small, high-speed vessels armed with missiles and torpedoes. US ships have allegedly been harassed by such vessels to the extent that they have been on the brink of firing on them. The Korean Peninsula will remain a potential flashpoint, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Il grooms his third son Kim Jong Un to succeed him. Kim Jong Un was appointed a four-star general in September and needs the backing of the military to assume power. This means that Pyongyang will be prone to Business Monitor International Ltd Page 61 North Korea United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 potentially provocative behaviour, such as more naval skirmishes, missile tests, or even a third nuclear test, as Jong Un seeks to prove his credentials. Owing to North Korea's substantial military , artillery forces, and weapons of mass destruction, a US strike on the country is virtually unthinkable. Tighter sanctions have been introduced, but China continues to support Pyongyang. Overall, even if the 'Six-Way' talks over North Korea's nuclear programme are resumed, we do not expect Pyongyang to make any meaningful concessions. Washington faces a great challenge in moving away from the previous administrations failure to offer the North Koreans security guarantees and to achieve normalised relations with the worlds most isolated and unpredictable state, which in 2009 pushed forward its nuclear and missile programme most evidently to enhance its bargaining power in future negotiations. North Korea oscillates between sabre-rattling through missile and two low-yield nuclear tests and threats to South Korea on land and at sea and agreeing to bargain. After testing its Taepodong-2 long-range ballistic missile in April 2009 and detonating its second nuclear weapon in May, North Korea carried out several short-range missile tests in July and October. It also reactivated the Yongbyon plutonium production plant in April and said it had restarted its uranium enrichment programme. Following the collapse of the six party talks in May 2009, preliminary negotiations were restarted in November with the visit of the US envoy to Pyongyang. As on previous occasions, North Korea continues to provoke the US administration by rattling sabres and then indicating a desire to return to the talks in order to get moved further up the list of priorities for the new US administration. Given North Koreas history of offering concessions only to subsequently break them, it can be seen as having forced the Obama administration to engage with North Korea according to the latters terms and timetable. The US is concerned about North Korea spreading its nuclear and missile technologies while furthering its own capabilities. The two controversial underground nuclear tests were below explosive yield expectations, but any such device exploded in or on a city would still dwarf any conventional explosion since 1945. Following the May 25 2009 test, as reported by Global Security Newswire on May 28 2009, senior security advisor General James Jones warned that the US concern is not just that have a nuclear weapon, its what theyre going to do with the technology and where its going to go that is, to terrorist groups or other near-failed states. Much of the initiatives launched by the US to stop maritime transportation of nuclear and other WMD materials are based on attempts to stop North Korean proliferation. However, North Koreas weapons exports and proliferation activities have been curtailed somewhat by tougher UN sanctions following the passing of UN Resolution 1874. As in the past, it remains to be seen if the US or other powers, faced with continuing Chinese shielding of North Korea, will be able to effect the denuclearisation of the pariah state during 2010 and beyond. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The lingering concern is the threat of a regional arms race if North Korea advances its nuclear and missile arsenal. South Korea and Japan possess a start-up nuclear capability, although neither country possesses any real intent or political backing to go nuclear. The US is still relying on China, as the main power in the region, to continue exercising control over Pyongyang, which is dependent on China for continuing aid. As a result of the US troop surge in Afghanistan and the concomitant reduction from Iraq, the former country is now the US' main military theatre, with Washington contributing 100,000 troops out of the 150,000 Western soldiers deployed there. This force now exceeds the Soviet Union's peak of 120,000 troops during its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, which ended in defeat. Nonetheless, Afghanistan's population has doubled since then, and the US and its allies have found themselves unable to defeat the Taliban insurgency and allow the pro-Western government in Kabul to consolidate its control over the country. Meanwhile, the US has become frustrated with the high level of corruption in Afghanistan, which arguably fuels the insurgency by undermining the effectiveness of government. The US strategy is to train up the Afghan National Army sufficiently so that the latter can maintain security. However, while the ANA now numbers 130,000, its effectiveness is undermined by high illiteracy among recruits and high levels of desertions. Meanwhile, the fact that Obama is on record as stating he wants to start withdrawing troops from July 2011 has arguably emboldened the Taliban, which probably believes that it can outlast American willpower to stay the course. Overall, we believe that the US will be forced to delay any substantial troop withdrawals, lest this be portrayed as a defeat. Beyond 2011, the Afghan war appears to be headed for an extended stalemate, which in time could result in a de facto partition of the country between a pro-Western north and a Taliban-controlled south. While no incumbent US official is advocating this, the idea could gain support if the present deadlock prevails. The war on terror is focused mainly in Afghanistan, which is set to continue indefinitely in some shape or form. Most US deaths and injuries are from Taliban IED attacks, which are growing in sophistication. Roadside IEDs account for at least 70% of US casualties. 2009 was the bloodiest year in this theatre for IEDs with 449 casualties killed by them. Other weapons used by the insurgents include RPGs and explosively formed penetrators , which penetrate all but the most up-to-date, heavily armoured vehicles. Apart from 30,000 extra troops, including 4,000 US Marines deployed into Southern Helmand province, the major surge launched towards the end of February 2010, Operation Moshtarak, is intended as a joint effort by Afghan and ISAF forces. The operation claimed considerable progress as of mid-March. Further Business Monitor International Ltd Page 63 The Afghanistan Campaign United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 cooperation has been achieved between and Coalition forces and the local people and Taliban forces have reported to have retreated . In August 2009, the US launched Operation Khanjar to clear insurgents out of Helmand Province, where most IED attacks take place, involving 4,000 US troops. In November 2009, Obama announced a speed deployment of an extra 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan during the first half of 2010 with pullout to begin in summer 2011 and full withdrawal by the end of 2013. Many political opponents and observers have criticised the setting of a deadline for a pullout, saying that this will considerably weaken the counterinsurgency effort. However, General Stanley McChrystals abrupt dismissal as Commander of US Forces Afghanistan in June 2010 as a direct result of comments made by him and his staff to Rolling Stone have complicated matters in the near term. McChrystals dismissal which was officially a resignation became a political necessity after his derogatory comments regarding civilian government officials were published; however, this made his removal no less inconvenient for Obama. McChrystal had been intimately involved in the direction of the Afghan campaign in his one year as USFOR-A Commander and strongly supported the surge in troop numbers. As a seasoned military leader, General David Petraeuss selection as a replacement for McChyrstal was a natural choice for Obama. The general was formerly the US Central Command commander and as such had a hand in Obamas reworked policy on the Afghan campaign revealed in late-2009. However, Petraeus has been known to be critical of a drawdown of US forces from July 2011. Petraeus perceived scepticism was the focus as his candidacy was questioned during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in late-June 2010. The general openly supported the pullout timeline, although he equivocally emphasised that a satisfactory balance must be found between providing a sense of urgency for US and allied forces and emboldening counterinsurgency forces by stating a withdrawal deadline. Many military commentators believe the US is losing the war in Afghanistan, a country where no occupying or intervening power has ever succeeded militarily. This was exacerbated by McChrystals dismissal as attention was refocused on the overall campaign. Not only is the conflict a classic example of asymmetric warfare and in danger of sinking into a stalemate, but defining success in the war has changed. In July 2009, Obama told Fox News that victory was not necessarily the goal of the US, and that it was not dealing with nation states... Were concerned with al-Qaeda and the Taliban, al-Qaedas allies. So when you have a non-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda, our goal is to make sure they cant attack the United States. Obama is aware that an eventual pullout depends on improving Afghanistans security, economy and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in June 2010 that relations with Pakistan must be rebuilt after deteriorating in the 1990s. Greater co-operation with Pakistan is a key component of the Afghan campaign, with al-Qaeda leadership located in the country, Navy Admiral Mike Mullen said. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 64 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The US officially ended combat operations in Iraq at the end of August 2010, by which time it had reduced its troop presence there to 50,000 from a peak of 170,000 in 2007. After September 1 2010, the US military formally assumed an advisory role, training and supporting Iraq's army and police. Beyond this, the remaining 50,000 troops are scheduled to be completely withdrawn by the end of 2011. However, there are growing concerns in Washington and Baghdad that Iraqi security forces are not sufficiently strong to maintain order. In August, Iraqi armed forces chief of staff Lt-Gen Babakar Zebari publicly stated that the military would not be ready to ensure security until at least 2020. In particular, he said that the real problems would start after 2011, by which time Iraq would theoretically be devoid of US troops. Zebari's views are believed to be shared by Iraqi and American generals. Our belief is that the US will indeed extend its military presence and keep substantial numbers of troops although not necessarily 50,000 in Iraq well beyond 2011. This would be politically unpopular, but the costs of exiting Iraq and leaving behind renewed chaos would arguably be even higher. Before Abdulmutallabs Christmas Day airline bomb attempt, Yemen was a close ally to the US in the war on terror. US military aid for the country is scheduled to increase in 2010 to US$66mn, including more support for counterinsurgency and antipiracy efforts, and for coast guard training and development. A few weeks before the attempted attack near Detroit, the US dispatched special operations teams to Yemen to help train the countrys troops. US firepower and intelligence is thought to be supporting government raids on suspected al-Qaeda hideouts within Yemeni borders. According to US and foreign government officials, the threat from further incursions into Yemen by al-Qaeda was heightened in 2009 before the December bomb attempt. Abdulmutallab said the explosives had been supplied to him in Yemen, where he had lived for several months and been trained by AQAP. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 65 Iraq Yemen United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 With a combined land, sea and air force of about 1mn active-duty personnel, the US is among the worlds largest. It spends more than any other country on defence; the defence budget is six times higher than Russias. There are 1,402,000 active military personnel in total. The US Army has 669,000 . The Air Force has 329,000 active personnel. The Navy has 328,000 personnel. In August 2009, the White House requested a transfer of at least US$1bn within the 2010 defence budget to increase the armys active duty forces by a further 15,000 troops. Robert Gates has already been approved to permanently increase the army total by 65,000 and add another 27,000 Marines. The additional 15,000 troops will bring the armys active-end strength to 818,000 and is intended to reduce strain on forces serving in Afghanistan . This will cost US$1bn, which the presidency is asking to come from cuts in procurement accounts, such as US$700mn for vitally needed Humvee and trucks. Procurement for the navy and Marine Corps would go down by US$156mn, with the same amount coming from aircraft procurement for the United States Air Force most notably modifications to the C-130 Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures . The US continues to have the worlds most technologically advanced force. Most notable recent advances in its conventional weapons systems are enhanced precision of its smart bombs and the deployment of E-bombs to counter electronic devices. The main strategic change is that in the post-Cold War, post-9/11 age, US forces are fighting two or three regional wars at once using conventional weapons. Nuclear weapons for strategic planning are increasingly irrelevant. The strategic shift has necessitated the procurement of increasing numbers and types of mobile equipment in theatre and the need to be based at locations where US forces can respond rapidly to a crisis anywhere around the world. This puts great pressure on deployment of forces, equipment, budgeting and forward planning. Afghanistan Operation Enduring Freedom Obama announced a speed deployment of an extra 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan within the first half of 2010, after the new US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, asked in September 2009 for an increase in troops to further the campaign. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 66 Armed Forces And Government Spending United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The additional force augments the 68,000 already approved but it is not as many as the 45,000 requested by the general. On September 21 2009, McChrystal said in a report that without an increase in US forces the conflict will likely result in failure. He went so far as to say the Afghan government was corrupt and that the campaign was being undermined by tactics that alienate the local populace, such as air and land attacks which kill civilians. In August 2009, McChrystal also proposed increasing the size of the Afghan army from 88,000 to 250,000 with the first increment from 92,000 to 134,000 personnel in 2010 requiring the recruitment and training of 5,000 troops per month. This is an important request as much depends on growing Afghan capability in dealing with the Taliban in order that the US and other countries troops can be drawn down. Political opposition to sending more forces in is based chiefly on the need to first focus on enhancing and training Afghan troops and police as main priority. Some in the Obama administration also want to wait before sending in more troops until the first increased deployment is completed end-2009. McChrystal describes the Taliban as a muscular and sophisticated enemy, which uses propaganda effectively and can recruit an endless supply of foot soldiers and bombers from Afghan prisons. The main area for deployment is the Taliban sanctuaries dotted throughout the mountainous Afghan/Pakistan border leading to the phrase the AfPak war with missile strikes coming uncomfortably close to Pakistani territory. Insurgents and al-Qaeda operatives move around from one side of the border to the other. Pakistan is under intense US pressure to add its weight against extremists based in the Pakistani tribal area. The fear is of a Pakistani-Taliban alliance that would solidify the militants grip over the border province of Waziristan. An important and controversial point in the McChrystal report is that a vital part of the mission is to protect Afghans rather than kill insurgents or control territory: Preoccupied with protection of our own forces, we have operated in a manner that distances us physically and psychologically from the people we seek to protect... The insurgents cannot defeat us militarily, but we can defeat ourselves. One proposal is that if the Afghans receive support as part of a renewed hearts and minds operation they will kick the Taliban out themselves. Militant leaders may lessen their attacks on Pakistani forces for fear of growing alienation from potential heartlands and are therefore focusing their attacks increasingly on coalition forces. McChrystal also wants other NATO countries, so far focused on training the Afghan forces, to send more reinforcements. The US is annoyed that failure by NATO countries to contribute more fighting troops means that the US must constantly meet the shortfall. On September 18, the new government in Japan announced it would be pulling back its support for the war in Afghanistan, where it currently deploys a supply ship and destroyer to the Indian Ocean to provide fuel and water to US and British naval vessels in the region. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 67 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The intensification of the Taliban campaign in March 2009 was compounded by an agreement by three rival Pakistan-based groups to unite against coalition forces. In 2008, some 5,000 people were killed, including at least 2,100 civilians a 40% increase on 2007. There is growing adverse response to US missile strikes causing civilian deaths. However, a new approach is discernible, since McChrystal became chief of allied operations in June. This, according to CNN News in July 2009, is measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed. Important developments in terms of US-Afghan plans include a proposed draft agreement that will reinforce the US commitment to Afghan security in return for pledges by the Afghan government to deal effectively with corruption and improve governance. US missile strikes on civilians increased in 2009, as did IED incidents in Pakistan, which insurgents said were in retaliation to increased operations by Pakistani forces aided by the US. The Pakistani military says its forces killed 650 militants in South Waziristan between October and mid-December 2009. Hundreds of civilians were killed in several multiple incidents including a suicide bomb attack on a volleyball match in north western Pakistan in December, which killed at least 88 people and wounded dozens more. There are fears that the Taliban will move further into areas where nuclear components are located. Defence Spending In July 2009, it was predicted that base spending on defence would rise by more than US$20bn over the year providing the budget plan of mid-2009 were to be approved by Congress. Obama signed into law a US$636bn FY10 defence budget. In a speech earlier in the month, he said that the Afghan troop surge could cost some US$30bn a year his administration having only sought US$68bn for the entire Afghanistan war effort in FY10. The finally approved budget for this is US$128bn. In May 2009, Obamas proposed defence budget to Congress was US$663bn for FY10, with the US Department of Defense budget request amounting to US$533bn to fund base defence programmes and US$130bn to support operations primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan. The December 2009 legislation includes specific funding of US$6bn for more than 6,600 all-terrain M-ATVs, the new version of the MRAP vehicle. This amounted to US$825mn above the initial requested amount, reflecting the ground forces urgent need for these vehicles. The Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund set up to move US forces from Iraq to Afghanistan will receive US$5bn. The December 2009 budget legislation earmarked US$3bn to improve the Army and Marines helicopter fleet. The large budget also meant some USAF programmes would not be cancelled, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter , which received the amount requested by the president US$6bn for 30 aircraft, including funds for the navy and marines to procure 20 aircraft. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 68 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The Navys aircraft procurement needs were met by some US$18bn, to include US$1bn for 18 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and on top, US$1bn for 22 Boeing EA-18G Growlers. There is US$15bn for seven shipbuilding projects some US$120mn more than the Navys request. By 2007, US defence spending was at the highest level since World War II, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute . It is hard to grasp, therefore, that as of writing, US spending on defence is actually less than 4% of the US GDP only 50% of Cold War levels. In 2008, the US Congressional Budget Office estimated that extra costs of conducting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could be from US$481bn to US$1trn from FY08 until FY17, depending on the level and pace of drawdown. The DoD is to cut back on some high-technology weapons systems deemed as blue-sky or wasteful, and spend more on military personnel and their families, on re-balancing programmes to improve current and future war capabilities, and on an overhaul of defence procurement, acquisition and contracting. Some 40% of defence spending is for conventional warfare equipment and training, 50% for irregular and conventional wars and 10% for asymmetric conflicts. It should be pointed out that the budget requests for US military expenditure do not include combat figures. These are supplemental requests for separate Congress approval. The nuclear weapons budget is not overseen by the US Defense Department, but falls under the Department of Energy. Its 2009 request was for US$29bn.

Afghanistan: Trying To End The Stalemate Obamas speedy deployment of an extra 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan within the first six months of 2010 will raise the US presence to 100,000. The reinforcements will be concentrated in Helmand and Kandahar provinces, where the insurgency is strongest, and in urban centres, expanding to more rural areas once, or if, Afghan government forces gradually gain more control. Serious questions are now being asked at the highest level about the sustainability of the US and Allied presence in Afghanistan. President Obamas troop surge is currently proving less effective than that of his predecessor in Iraq. He faces criticism from all sides: many politicians and commentators, and an increasing proportion of the public, argue that the troops should be brought home. On the other hand, some, particularly in military circles, suggest that the surge was insufficient, with the President choosing to split the difference between diametrically opposed views and sending in too few troops for the move to be successful, as reported by the Economist and other publications in September 2010. A September article in Eurasia Review suggested that the US has insufficient resources to win the war with the Taliban before the July 2011 pullout date set by the President . The Review suggested that Washington may have concluded that victory in Afghanistan is simply not worth it given pressures from domestic policy and a tightening budget. It noted that the concentration of troops currently in Afghanistan 150,000 from the International Security Assistance Force and 170,000 in the Afghan security forces, fell well below the 20:1000 security personnel:population ratio considered necessary for putting down counter insurgency according to conventional wisdom. But Obama will surely be loath to send substantial new forces from an already stretched military. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 70 Table: Foreign Deployments United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The situation is one of uncertainty from all sides, but one fact is becoming increasingly clear: the US and its Allies, while making progress in some areas, are not close to defeating the Taliban, let alone leaving Afghanistan a stable and functioning country. There are a number of options open to Obama and his allies, none particularly palatable. A renewed surge would be costly and unpopular, and risk admitting that current efforts are failing; withdrawal would widely be seen as a defeat for the Allies, and leave a strategically important country destabilised and risking a power vacuum. The Afghan security forces are not yet effective enough to be able to control the country, and have been infiltrated by drug gangs and, in some cases, insurgents. Afghanistan is close to the Al-Qaeda badlands of north-west Pakistan, as well as the energy rich countries of Central Asia. It is within striking distance of Iran, with which tensions are again on the rise, and China, the USs long-term strategic rival. It is also a major source of hard drugs. Leaving the country entirely, even in nine months time, does not look a realistic option. Therefore the US may persevere with current troop levels but increase the level of discussions with local warlords, including the Taliban, striking deals to reduce the intensity of conflict. It is looking increasingly likely that the US will exit Afghanistan with its original mission very far from accomplished, with potentially troubling consequences for its interests in the region. On the other hand, it will be able to concentrate resources on areas where there is a growing existential threat: Iran, North Korea, even Mexico, where drug-related crime and violence have risen significantly. Attention may also continue to turn to Pakistans north-west, continuing a process that has arguably been underway for some time. In September, three top al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US drone attack in the region, as reported by the Times of India. For some time, the consensus view has been that al-Qaeda is gaining strength in Pakistan, where it offers a more serious long-term threat to regional stability than the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Afghan government announced in January 2011 that it had not yet discussed the potential establishment of a permanent US military base in the Central Asian country, Xinhua reported. President Hamid Karzais chief spokesman told a press conference that while the issue of long-term strategic partnership was on the current agenda, a permanent base had not been discussed. The comment was made in response to the reported suggestion of US Senator Lindsay Graham that the US should have a permanent military presence in Afghanistan. The fact that Afghanistan has not refuted the idea outright may indicate that it is a real possibility. While there is a strong public feeling at present that the US should withdraw from Afghanistan as soon as possible, the possibility of establishing a permanent base will surely have occurred to senior military and political figures. Through the base, the US could monitor developments in the energy-rich but unstable Central Asia region, a major area of contention between major powers for centuries. A base would also allow the US to respond more quickly to threats in the region, and potentially act as a check on Russian Business Monitor International Ltd Page 71 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 and Chinese influence in Afghanistan. Many observers feel that, should the US withdraw from Afghanistan completely, they will leave the country vulnerable to Beijing and Moscows influence. Were a base to be established, Washington would have to handle the overseas diplomacy and domestic political reaction very carefully, so the process is likely to be a long, drawn-out affair. A January 2011 poll by CNN/Opinion Research Corporation found that 63% of Americans oppose the war in Afghanistan, with only 35% supporting the US presence, a substantial drop over nine months. The public mood is still pessimistic, despite signs of some stabilisation since the US started its troop surge. Operation Moshtarak, which commenced in February 2010, is aimed at backing up security around Kandahar and recapturing remaining Taliban positions in Chah-e-Anjir, Western Babaji, Trek Narwa and Marjah in Helmand province. It is the biggest test to date for counter-insurgency in this theatre, aimed at getting rid of the militants and re-establishing government control and civil services. But much depends on the success of the Counter-Improvised Explosive Device task force, and on the further equipping by NATO nations of the Afghan National Security Forces. As such, Moshtarak will not win the war through set-piece battles as in former eras. Rather it will succeed only if allied and Afghan forces together move a substantial portion of the population from Taliban influence. The C-IED operation is focusing increasingly on gathering forensic intelligence to break the bombers supply chains. The CEXE units conduct such investigations at Kandahar and other major US bases in Afghanistan reinforcing the statement made by Counter-IED Coordinator of Regional Command South, Mark Lee: The best bomb is one thats never made. However, the challenge the teams face appears insurmountable with the Taliban deploying bigger and more heavily disguised devices, using up to 680kg of explosive, most often ammonium nitrate to destroy the new generation of MRAPs vehicles. C-IED equipment has improved, however, and includes remotely tracked vehicles and state-of-the-art mine detectors such as the Vallon, and the Python, a mine-clearing rocket-propelled system pulled behind the Trojan armoured engineer tank. Operation Moshtarak will prove to be the ultimate test of logistical support for the troops operating in difficult terrain in a remote, landlocked country riddled with insurgents, with little remaining in the way of internal infrastructure. Unlike the Iraq operation, where Kuwait provided a staging ground for supplies, fuel and equipment, everything for Afghanistan has to be brought in from across continents and across the Pakistan border. Airborne supplies have to be landed through crowded airspace on limited air landing facilities filled with heavy-lift cargo planes carrying troops and armoured vehicles. Transporting materials across land is not only hazardous but has to pass through the hands of locals who pay the Taliban protection money to ensure safe passage. The US has already begun airlifts of five M-ATV armoured vehicles per flight on Boeing 747-400 freightliners. In addition the air force is flying a quicker route over the North Pole and southwards across Business Monitor International Ltd Page 72 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, to minimise the threat of land-based ambushes. On March 19, the Army applied the new multimodal concept of operations - transporting kit by sea as well as air by sending 130 M-ATVs on a three-week journey, initially by ship to an unnamed Southwest Asia ally. The vehicles were then loaded onto C-17 aircraft and flown for six hours into Afghanistan. With a further 170 vehicles due to be shipped via this route later in March, the Army intends to continue using it to transport 1,000 M-ATVs per month. For the global tracking of cargo, the US Army Logistics Innovation Agency has introduced Radio Frequency Identification as the DoD standard. Military commanders have also requested more C-130 aircraft for time-sensitive, mission-critical cargo delivery into Afghanistan, having successfully trialled the aircraft in Iraq, where C-130s were used as a surrogate for the new transport aircraft. The Army wants the C-130s, 400 of which are held in the USAF inventory, to relieve a proportion of the burden placed on CH-47 Chinook helicopters. According to head of US Central Command General David Petraeus, it will be December 2010 before the Defense Department can monitor the progress of the troop surge, with a predicted increase in insurgency violence in the spring and a rise in security incidents in the summer. Petraeus told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December 2009: While certainly different and in some ways tougher than Iraq, Afghanistan is no more hopeless than Iraq was when I took command there in February 2007. He added: Achieving progress in Afghanistan will be hard, and the progress there likely will be slower in developing than was the progress achieved in Iraq. Putting forward a strategy combining enhanced security with hearts and minds, McChrystal told CNN that the Taliban insurgency could be cut off from the Afghan population by US and Afghan forces taking over and expanding security zones, which would make it harder for the Taliban to recruit and establish heartlands. At the end of the day, the insurgency needs access to the population to be effective, he said. The US Ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that legitimate economies in Afghanistan must be supported to give local people a means of making a living other than joining the insurgency. Substantial international funding is necessary to get the countrys armed and police forces well equipped, trained and motivated, which is likely to last 10-15 years. In support of this, Petraeus said: It is a lot cheaper to maintain a certain number of Afghan forces than to maintain the number of US and coalition forces required to compensate for their absence. A surge of 21,000 US troops was put into theatre in spring 2008. The 2009 increase is intended to solidify US presence in areas captured from the Taliban, and thereby add further security for the Afghan people, while enabling vital reconstruction and development. Commanders on the ground say that even the increased current force numbers are insufficient. Chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, said on September 15 2009 that as many as an extra Business Monitor International Ltd Page 73 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 10,000 to 45,000 troops were needed on the ground. He said: We cannot do that from offshore. You cannot do that by just killing the bad guys. You have to be there. Since the war began 1,192 US troops have died and the total wounded as of January 2010 is 4,434. In total, 1,985 coalition forces have died in Afghanistan since 2001, as of the end of August 2010, according to iCasualties.org. There were 304 combat-related deaths in 2009, making it the bloodiest year of the war, compared with 151 in 2008, the Associated Press reported. Deaths and injuries continue to be mainly from IED attacks, which increased in sophistication in 2009, with 129 troop deaths attributed to roadside explosives, compared with 82 IED-related deaths in 2008. October 2009 was the worst month since the war began, in terms of casualties, with 22 dead as of September 16. Some 50% of US combat casualties in Afghanistan are from IED attacks. Making the war among the most difficult to fight in recent times is the logistical problem of getting supplies to troops in landlocked, undeveloped territory, where IED attacks on supply convoys have increased. The nearest military distribution centre is in Kuwait, 1,600km away. A backup centre may be set up in southern Kandahar by the Defense Logistics Agency to support Marine and Army operations, There are varying costs of transporting a 10-tonne M-ATV from the US to Bagram Air Base, ranging from US$130,000 via a commercial 747 cargo jet, which can carry five M-ATVs, to US$19,000 to send it by cargo ship to Karachi in Pakistan, and then by flatbed truck through the Khyber Pass. 2009 was the bloodiest for IED attacks on coalition forces. The number and sophistication of IEDs have increased there were 7,000 bomb incidents in 2009, compared with 81 in 2003. According to ISAF figures, 129 of US fatalities in 2009 were because of IEDs, more than 40% of troop casualties. Out of 129 Coalition casualties in 2010, 117 were caused by IED attacks. According to an August report by the US DoD JIEDDO, in the latter half of 2009 the enhanced lethality of Taliban IEDs is due to the incorporation of non-metal often plastic components which are far more difficult to detect with portable mine-detectors. Anti-personnel bombs are cheaper and very plentiful, which marks a move away from previous larger anti-armour bombs used in roadside attacks. In this spate of attacks, more devices are therefore causing more deaths and injuries. Added to this new element is the growing use of booby-trapped devices that are triggered by the victim, and the use of long pull-cords a type of command wire rather than setting them off with an electronic signal . Command-wire signal to detonate the devices is less likely to get jammed by C-IED forces or aircraft. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 74 IEDs More Deadly United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Many Taliban IEDs have over 2,500kg of high explosives in them, which can take out even the heaviest armoured vehicles. The Taliban are acquiring vast amounts of ammonium nitrate as fertiliser from local farmers to make many of the bulk bombs being exploded in the region. In a renewed attempt to deal with IEDs, in November 2009 US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that a task force would be set up to focus on counter-IED measures following several critical reports of insufficient integration of, and wasted funds by, the various groups within the department involved in C-IED operations. Among these was Actions Needed to Improve Visibility and Coordination of DODs Counter-Improvised Explosive Device Efforts, published by the Government Accountability Office in October 2009, on the US C-IED operation in Afghanistan. The report criticises the US Joint IED Defeat Organisation , the body established in 2006 to coordinate all C-IED efforts, for not having sufficiently focused on IEDs as a weapon of choice until IED attacks began to increase in Iraq at the end of major combat operations. There was also duplication of acquisition by JIEDDO and the armed forces, and investment in C-IED equipment that does not meet existing service requirements. However, JIEDDO is introducing new surveillance programmes, such as Task Force ODIN which involves the setting up of wide-angle video cameras for intensive roadside IED surveillance. In December 2009, JIEDDO director Thomas Metz was replaced by Michael Oates. There is also an urgent need to provide new mine detectors, as the current AN/PSS-12 is not sensitive enough to spot the scarcely used metal in the current spate of anti-personnel IEDs . There is increasing pressure to replace older versions of the heavily armoured MRAP vehicles, which were designed for Iraq and at 18,000-36,200kg are too heavy and cumbersome for Afghanistans undeveloped road network. A lighter version, the M-ATV, weighing about 11,339kg, will replace the old MRAP vehicles, which are to be sent back to the US. However, these may not be sufficiently resistant to the very large IEDs being deployed. In contrast to Afghanistan, December 2009 was the first month with no US deaths since the Iraq war began in 2003. From January 2010, the name of the US force in Iraq was changed from the Multinational Force-Iraq to the US Force-Iraq, as no non-US coalition forces remain. There are 110,000 US troops stationed in Iraq, including 12 combat brigades at 75 US bases, with no other countrys forces. There are expected to be fewer than 50,000 by August 2010. They face the continued and increasingly violent presence of al-Qaeda in Iraq and, from the other side, attacks on civilians from Shiite militias sponsored by Iran. On June 30 2009, the US officially withdrew troops from Iraqi population centres, following the surge operation during 2007, when troop levels reached 170,000. US-led combat operations are due to end by September 2010, with all troops gone from Iraq by the end of 2011. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 75 Iraq Drawing Down, But What Next? United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The cost of running the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is estimated at US$170bn for 2009 alone approaching Cold War spending levels. It has cost the US a total of US$800bn for its operations in Iraq, including US$76bn requested by President Obama in 2009 and approved by congress. Some US$12bn was spent in 2008. From Congressional hearings in February 2007, the US government was accused of wasting or mismanaging US$10bn. The timeline for withdrawal was set by the Status of Forces Agreement between then president Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, with August 2010 the date for withdrawal of all combat troops and the total withdrawal of US forces from all areas by the end of 2011. During the election campaign, Obama said he would withdraw all troops within 16 months of being elected, but stated his intention to maintain a substantial residual force, the numbers of which would depend on further assessments of the security situation. After the security situation improved through 2008 relative to previous post-invasion years , several bombings occurred following the initial withdrawal of combat troops from major cities and towns in June 2009, including four soldiers killed in two bombings in Northern Iraq on September 8. This area remains dangerous and insurgency-ridden, but attacks are not confined to the north. In August 2009, two enormous explosions at the Iraqi Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance killed more than 100 and injured many more. In February 2009, Obama said the US cannot police Iraqs streets indefinitely until they are completely safe. However, there is political opposition to the numbers planned to be kept stationed in Iraq. The number of American military fatalities in Afghanistan in 2009 was double that of 2008. Some 319 US service personnel were killed, compared with 155 in 2008, not including five US intelligence officers that were among eight US civilians killed in an insurgent strike in the last week of the year in east Afghanistan. In 2009, 152 American service members died a fall of 50% on 2008, when 314 died. The decrease in fatalities is partly due to the US preparation for withdrawal by the end of 2011, with troops staying largely on bases, Some 4,372 US troops have been killed in Iraq; 31,557 have been wounded. Some 318 coalition troops have also been killed. Terrorist attacks have continued during 2009, intensifying in the second half of the year, with multiple and regular bomb blasts in Baghdad and the oil-rich province of Kirkuk causing 170 deaths and hundreds of injuries during the 10 days before the June withdrawal alone. At least one attack per week, including multiple attacks, occurred in December 2009. Al-Qaeda in Iraq and other groups have since been trying to take advantage of the US drawdown to further stir up sectarian conflict. Ninevah province in the north and Mosul have been targets. This will make further withdrawals in 2010 highly critical. The total troop numbers are only expected to be reduced to less than 128,000 following the January national elections in Iraq. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 76 Casualties United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 In September 2009, General Ray Odierno, in charge of US troops in Iraq, stated a need for limited-length deployment of troops into a disputed northern territory, including Ninevah, where tensions are growing between Kurdish militia and Iraqi security forces. Recent bombings in Kirkuk province have killed more than 250. Their mission would be to facilitate the end of conflict between the two groups as the US forces are trusted in this area. Counterterrorism Overseas The US is in a constant process of enhancing its counterterrorism capabilities at home and abroad. For example, in August 2009 it beefed up its Internal Security Forces Mobile Forces Special Weapons and Tactics teams for the Anti-terrorism Assistance programme, which trains the ISF in dealing with overseas hostage situations and is intended to increase readiness in Lebanon and other vulnerable areas. Yemen is set to receive more US counterterrorism resources, including direct military help to overcome the growing threat of AQAP in the country. President Obama has pledged to set a new direction in US nuclear weapons policy and show the world that America believes in its existing commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to work to ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons. This was a substantial factor in his having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. Obama's ambitious plan to begin phasing out the major nuclear weapons arsenals of the world is meeting considerable opposition from the DoD. It is possible that the Obama administration is tempering the plan by rejecting proposals that the US declare a no-first-use policy. This would ensure that the US will maintain the option to strike first with nuclear weapons. The negotiations towards the new strategic arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia have also stalled over the Russians demanding to be able to withdraw unilaterally if they believe that the US ballistic missile defence plan will threaten its ICBM capability. This prime BMD sticking point has become more complicated by Obama's decision to deploy US anti-missile interceptors in Romania, having in September 2009 withdrawn the plan to deploy Ground-Based Interceptors in the Czech Republic and Poland. If the Russians win the option over BMD, this would present Obama with a further obstacle to gaining vitally needed Republican votes for the senate to ratify the new treaty. In July 2009, the US and Russian presidents, apart from signing a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to reduce substantially their nuclear arsenals, agreed to embark on negotiations to cut their nuclear stockpiles by at least 30%. The US has 10,000 nuclear weapons out of a world total of 24,000, Russia has 13,000. Problems lie ahead with verification, without which no treaty based on trust and verify can work effectively and without which Congress may not allow funding for dismantlement of warheads. The US has taken 1,000 nuclear warheads out of operational status. Small-scale production of W88 nuclear warheads was resumed in 2007, with the last new warheads produced as far back as 1992. The Business Monitor International Ltd Page 77 Weapons Of Mass Destruction United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 USAF W62 warhead will be retired in 2009. The Minuteman missiles being equipped with more powerful W87/Mk-21 warheads, as well as upgrades of ICBM engines, fuel, guidance systems and software. By improving accuracy and firepower, less can be more. The milestone year of 2012 is set for the upper limit to be achieved of 2,200 operationally deployed warheads per country. New strategies will be needed to accommodate the reduced size of inventory, as it will not be sufficient for the US military to target all forms of WMD targets, command and control installations, political and military leaderships, and the military-industrial complexes of Russia, China and other rival or burgeoning nuclear states. The new reduced arsenal will also necessitate changes to the expensive and extensive Cold War-vintage nuclear triad of delivery platforms at sea, on land and in the air. There are no standing chemical weapons or biological weapons programmes. The original CW facilities have been dismantled and the arsenals are being disposed of at various locations. BW expertise remains within the existing research and development facilities, such as USAMRIID at Fort Detrick, in order to produce medical countermeasures to bioterrorist-related diseases. Defense Department investigations have been conducted into several internal USAF and security breaches. A lack of attention to the nuclear mission was identified from the well-publicised loss of six nuclear Advanced Cruise Missiles at Minot Air Force Base in August 2007 and the mistaken transfer of three W62/Mk-12 nose cones to Taiwan. As a result of the Minot AFB security lapse, the USAF intended to install a new Global Strike Command by September 2009, and has moved the nuclear bomber force away from the auspices of Air Combat Command to the new command, along with the ICBM force, formerly under Space Command. The main thrust of Obamas nuclear policy, as announced in Prague in May 2009, is to improve security of nuclear arsenals in countries of concern most urgently, Pakistan, where the US has provided dollars to enhance security and failsafe systems at nuclear sites. His long-term stated aim is to eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons, but this is not a new aim previous presidents, including Reagan, have stated this. Opponents such as former defense secretary James D Schlesinger cite the dangers of a reduced nuclear complement: that parity must be maintained with the old enemies, Russia and China, which have been modernising their missile forces. He also fears that the nuclear umbrella over Americas allies, such as Japan, will not be maintained, in the face of growing Chinese strength. Countries such as Iran will also not be deterred sufficiently from forwarding their nuclear aims, and will soon possess a breakout capability enabling them to switch to a military programme from a civilian one, and to maintain small stockpiles of less secure weapons. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 78 Nuclear And Missile Defence Policy United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 In September 2009, it was reported that Obama had rejected the first draft of the next Defense Department Nuclear Posture Review, scheduled for publication end 2009, because it did not make sufficient reductions in the US arsenal. Among the range of options to fulfil his aim to eliminate nuclear weapons worldwide are reconfiguring US nuclear forces so that the eventual number of deployed strategic warheads will number hundreds rather than thousands, and to narrow down the options for nuclear first use. Obama also wants to see better ways of guaranteeing weapons reliability without a resumption of testing, or the production of new generation warheads. BMD The combination of missile testing and increased intransigence of Iran is leading to the US switch its testing against missile attacks from North Korea to Iran, according to head of the US Missile Defense Agency, Lieutenant General Patrick OReilly. The US plans to conduct a test, costing US$150m, in January 2010, in which interceptor missiles will be fired at a simulated Iranian missile launch from the Pacific. On September 18 2009, Obama suspended a substantial part of the multibillion-dollar, son of Star Wars ballistic missile programme furthered by the Bush administration as a protective shield against missiles launched by nations that could threaten continental US, its allies, and overseas interests. The decision to suspend missile defence deployments for Poland and the Czech Republic has been reportedly made on the assumption that Irans long-range missile programme is not sufficiently advanced to warrant it. This follows overtures made to Russia, which continues to oppose US BMD deployment, in March 2009 in return for Russian cooperation in dealing with Irans nuclear intentions. The Russians hotly opposed US plans to site a missile base in Poland and radars in the Czech Republic, viewing them as threats to its national security, also with the experience of BMDs predecessor, the Reagan SDI programme, having to a great extent broken the back of the Soviet economy during the 1980s. It is possible that radar and other installations will be sited in other countries, however. The new BMD since Obamas cutback decision is, for the initial phase, to deploy Aegis-equipped vessels with SM-3 interceptors to Europe by 2011. These are to be supported by forward-deployed Army radar systems. The DoD will examine potential bases for the upgraded SM-3 in Europe. Additional sensors and interceptors are needed to provide coverage for the whole region, and include army Patriot missiles and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense missile system. According to Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps General James Cartwright, a directional X-band radar will also be needed. A report published by the Government Accountability Office in September 2009 claimed that the Department of Defense had failed to take a comprehensive view of the technical and manpower needs of several elements of the BMD System. The DoD cannot make a full assessment of its overall requirements without the vital information needed to make effective policy, strategy and budgetary decisions. The Business Monitor International Ltd Page 79 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 GAO states that the DoD had not created adequate units or trained troops to operate the missile defence elements before activating them. Another main priority of the Obama administration is to prevent nuclear materials and technology proliferation, particularly to break international networks, as Abdul Qadeer Khans nuclear Wal-Mart did, which spread uranium enrichment technologies and equipment, and weapons designs, to Iran, Libya and North Korea in the 1990s. The NPT is also up for review in 2010. Measures to counter movement of materials at sea are in process on a growing global scale most notably, the US Megaports Initiative to install radiological scanning equipment at the worlds main chokepoint ports, although negotiations are still pending for several more ports of interest. Firms and entities in China and North Korea have been repeatedly sanctioned for trading in WMD-related materials, most notably missile technologies and components. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 80 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 As with all defence sectors, the US sector depends entirely on government funding. The 2011 defence budget request at US$708bn includes substantial funding of Special Forces, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other equipment for the Afghanistan theatre and the Iraq drawdown. More than US$21bn is lined up for Afghanistan, with overall procurement expenditure rising by almost 8%. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost, as of March 2010, US$159bn. Of significance to the near- and medium-term prospects for procurement and the defence industry is the core concept in the QDR and defence budget that the current missions in Iraq and Afghanistan are open-ended, and are actually a model for future engagements. The bill for defence spending for FY2010, stood at US$636bn, and was aimed mainly at equipping the ground troops in the Afghan theatre. That it exceeded the request by about US$825mn is indicative of this need specifically, for complete procurement of over 6,600 new M-ATVs. Overall, the budget includes US$101bn for the Iraq and Afghanistan operations. The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, which was slated for total cancellation, was saved by an appropriation of US$6bn, some US$825mn above the request. The US navy and the US Marine Corps have also secured funding for 20 F-35 Lightning IIs as part of the total US$6bn award for 30 F-35s. In total, US$18bn was made available for aircraft for the Navy, including US$1bn for 18 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and US$1bn set aside for 22 Boeing EA-18G Growlers. The proposed CG cruiser for the Navy is to be terminated. In March 2010, DoD officials warned that increasing programme costs may lead to them ordering fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighters than previously intended. According to Janes, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Ashton Carter, has indicated that the department is planning to change the F-35 contract with Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor, from the present 'cost-plus' arrangement to a fixed-price deal. Under the fixed-cost system, LMs proposed costs, based on specific government requirements for the F-35, would be arranged ahead of time with the company receiving the fixed-price amount however long the project took. The USAF, Navy and Marine Corps plan to buy more than 2,400 JSFs in three variants. Out of this total, the US Navy plans to buy a total of 680, but it is not yet clear how many each Navy branch will receive., In March, the Navy announced its intention to provide the Marine Corps with catapult-ready F-35C JSFs as well as the short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing F-35B variant already ordered. The F-35Bs will be set to fly from amphibious assault ships by 2012, with carrier-based F-35Cs possibly added to the complement. However, the US ban on export of the F-22 did not bode well for the foreign military sale of the aircraft. Earlier in 2009, Japan and Australia were interested in buying it as possibly was the UK Ministry of Defence. The cost of restarting and certifying the F-22 production line for all suppliers would be too Business Monitor International Ltd Page 81 Market Overview United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 great for the production of small lots of F-22s for export. The F-22 is designed to destroy enemy air defences in the early stages of any conflict and to clear the way for land missions. There is also US$80mn for more unmanned Predator drone aircraft, which are an increasingly important tool in the US air war in the AfPak war. The unmanned Predators and larger Reaper drones are equipped with infrared cameras and armed with precision-guided bombs and Hellfire missiles. This will benefit defence industry giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrup Grumman, which were down by as much as 30% on investment after Obama became president but then recovered later in 2009. It is expected that some of these companies may have to lay off workers, but that smaller niche technology and service companies will gain the advantage to fulfil the need for greater protection for US ground troops and to safeguard military computer networks against cyber attack. The need for state of the art fighter jets and missile systems is being questioned. The defence sector is undergoing major changes due to cuts in spending on traditional conventional weapons systems and is adjusting to new asymmetric challenges. Immediate needs are for equipment to fight the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the former having intensified and extended to fighting a guerrilla war in a variety of environments. Although the US spends more than any other country on defence US$534bn is the budget proposal for 2010 the need to reorder priorities will mean major changes. It is predicted by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments that further reductions in spending may harm industry revenues beyond 2010. The defence and security sectors are being increasingly combined in terms of weapons and systems programmes, R&D and production, marketing and procurement. The change of the BAE name from British Aerospace to BAE Systems reflects the growing trend in the industry for advanced systems. And an interesting development to keep up with current threats is the launch of anti-piracy systems by BAE Systems at the London DSEi show in September. While there have been improvements in fitting new equipment to suit new missions, there are still gaps to be fulfilled. Long delays in the US procurement system and shortfalls in funding for procurements increase costs. The product bought at the end is not necessarily of the same standard as it was when it began on the drawing board. The greatest need is for MRAPs of varying capabilities and adaptations. More than 14,000 MRAPs were ordered by mid-2008, reaching US$7bn in orders by 2007 and US$3bn in 2008. The four manufacturers are BAE Systems, Force Protection, General Dynamics Land Systems Canada and Navistar. Some programmes have been cancelled, including Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles for the Army, the VH-71 presidential helicopter, and CSAR-X search-and-rescue helicopter. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 82 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The MGVs were cancelled before production began. Designed as speedy and lightly-armoured vehicles, they were intended to reduce manned vehicle vulnerability as an integral part of a Future Combat Systems communications network of small ground robots, aerial drones and guided missiles. The whole FCS programme was to be constructed, for US$92bn, by Boeing and SAIC. Of great significance, however, is that the MGVs were vulnerable to roadside IEDs the main threat facing troops in the Afghan theatre. Military chiefs are said to have wanted to avoid spending extra funds on modifications to the MGVs to enable them to survive hits by IEDs. Other sizeable weapons programmes are being cut back, such as the DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer for the Navy. The December budget, however, will save the F-22 Raptor fighter, due to an appropriation of US$6bn for the USAF. The USAF originally wanted to buy up to 800 F-22s, but this was cut to 442, then 381, and then cut again to just over 180, less than a quarter of the total sought when the programme began during the Cold War. The Raptors manufacturer, Lockheed Martin , has been fiercely campaigning to keep production lines open with 95,000 US jobs at stake. By December 2009, the USAF was building momentum to sell this highly advanced aircraft to US allies, such as Japan as a prime way of upping production numbers. Although the US budget is vast, to cover internal equipment needs, exports of arms are still vital for this business and to maintain skilled employment, as well as preserving an option to buy more F-22s later without having to pay the full costs of restarting production. Japan had been obliged to consider other options following the FY10 US defence budget that ended F-22 production and also maintained the export ban on the aircraft, Tokyo had been trying to purchase two F-22 squadrons amounting to 40 aircraft. USAF planners are becoming concerned about a possible capability gap between other US fighters and competing Russian aircraft, such as the SU-30 family and MiG-35, with the end of F-22 production in 2010, and about the ratio of aircraft to the total of R&D and production money spent on the project. There is also fierce competition from BAE Systems with its Eurofighter and Boeings F-15SE. This is a noted example of changing needs since the end of the Cold War and the growth of asymmetric warfare: there is less need in todays conflicts for air-to-air combat aircraft. There is a renewed focus, however, on the F-35 Lightning II , Littoral Combat Ship and the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer. A row between the USAF and DoD centred on spending US$60bn on an aircraft, which has never been used in Iraq or Afghanistan, and which would mean cutting costs on other vital programmes mainly on intelligence, reconnaissance, and USAF command and control for joint operations. In April 2009, Lockheed said it would accept the DoD decision and would cease lobbying Congress to make more F-22s. The 2010 budget will enable construction of only three new stealth destroyers. However, the DoD is committed to buying more Littoral Combat Ships , as they are designed and modifiable for Business Monitor International Ltd Page 83 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 operations in coastal areas on counter-insurgency and anti-piracy operations in shallow waters making them more suited to the demands of asymmetric warfare. In terms of streamlining, manufacturers of the new DDG-1000 destroyer, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, were told by the DoD to combine production at one shipyard. The US remains the worlds number one defence exporter, at US$6,795bn. The major contractors to the US DoD have yearly revenues in excess of US$8bn. US military expenditure is 41% of the world total. Many developing countries rely on arms imports and provide a rising market. The overall world volume of trade went down in 2008, but is viewed as a short-term decrease. Total US arms trade in 2000-2007 was US$134bn in constant dollars 38% of the world total. In 2007, the US was, according to official government data, the worlds biggest arms exporter. The US reserves the right to ensure its weapons sold overseas are used for their intended purpose and that defence technology is not passed on or leaked to third-party countries. This has delayed some deals such as the sale to India of new fighter aircraft and ships. This follows on from the Indian proposal that production is initiated in American shipyards and is then transferred to Indian shipyards. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said in April 2010 that the countrys export controls ought to be overhauled. Gates said that the controls were more suited to the Cold War environment and now served only to constrain supplies to allies while easing market penetration by foreign defence companies. The notoriously cumbersome International Traffic in Arms Regulations , backed by the Arms Export Control Act, spreads the export process over a number of agencies goods lists. The result is a far more opaque and laborious trade environment than exists in comparable countries. Enacted in 1976, the import-export regulations helped impede the proliferation of advanced technology produced in the US, helping the country far surpass rivals in technological sophistication. Canada has been largely exempted from the ITAR for some time but other allies, most notably Australia and the UK, have become increasingly frustrated over restrictions. Both countries each have bilateral draft treaties that would reform trade between the parties, although these are still waiting to be ratified in the US. Gates comments show that there continues to be fairly strong political will to reform ITAR or at least legislate bilateral exemptions at executive level, which has been the case since the Clinton administration. Such efforts continue to founder at the legislator level, however, with both the Senate and Congress stymieing ratification largely on security concerns. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 84 Arms Trade Overview United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Nonetheless, under pressure from the domestic defence industry as well as foreign governments, Gates built on efforts by the previous two administrations in April 2010 by announcing the most comprehensive ITAR reform programme yet. The reform overhauls the current systems of controls by creating a single new agency to interpret and implement the regulations. Moreover, one new list will replace the existing multiple lists of defence items controlled by ITAR. This streamlining is no less dependent on Congressional cooperation, however. Imports In 2009, defence imports increased by around US$20mn to US$831mn, coming mainly from the UK, Canada and South Africa. The imported products were overwhelmingly aircraft and armoured vehicles . According to SIPRI, from 2004-2008 the US was the worlds seventh largest importer of conventional weapons, having been in 14th place from 1999 to 2003. During 2004-2008 it was the Americas largest importer. From 2004-2008, EU member states account for nearly 50% of US defence imports, although much of production for contracts is carried out in the US. Several high-level bids have favoured European products over US products, such as the EC-145 helicopter and C-27J transport aircraft. Exports According to SIPRI in FY09, exports went up by US$700mn compared with 2008, reaching US$67bn, and exceeding our earlier estimate of US$40bn and another prediction by Aviation Week & Space Technology, in September 2009, of US$50bn in FY09, The main recipients were Pakistan ; South Korea; and the UAE. Exports to the UK went down from US$451mn in 2008 to US$166mn, and having imported no defence items in 2008, NATO, Malaysia, Mexico, Qatar, Thailand and Lebanon were beneficiaries in 2009. There was a US$300mn increase in armoured vehicle exports, and missiles with engines also increasing by over US$100mn. Aircraft remains the biggest earner at US$4,474bn, up more than US$300mn on 2008. The UAE edged closer to securing a Terminal High Altitude Defence missile system from the US in June 2010. Lockheed Martin said that it expects the US government to issue a letter of agreement to the UAE by August 2010, The National reported. Lockheed Martin is the main developer in the deal, with Raytheon providing radar technology. In 2009, new importers of US defence goods were NATO, Malaysia, Mexico, Qatar, Thailand and Lebanon. Afghanistan and Pakistan are growing markets; Taiwan and South Korea, as well as several Middle Eastern countries remain Business Monitor International Ltd Page 85 New Markets United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 promising markets. The top five importers of US defence articles and services in FY09 were FY08, in order of amounts agreed in FMS contracts in dollar value terms, were Israel, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Egypt and Poland, whose appearance in the league table was from its purchase of 48 F-16 fighter aircraft in 2002. The Jordanians put in an order to the Javelin JV of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for 1,808 Javelin missiles worth US$388mn in December 2009, a deal which also includes 18 fly-to-buy missiles and 162 Javelin command launch units. Also in December, Lockheed Martin won a contract from the Moroccan government, worth US$841mn to supply 24 F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighters and related equipment. Military exports to India have also resulted from a continuing favourable relationship with the US. Boeing, in particular, is looking to India as a lucrative market, working towards contracts that could be worth at least US$20bn in the next few years for a huge range of equipment: tactical aircraft, tactical transport aircraft, heavy lift helicopters, attack helicopters, maritime patrol and airborne early warning systems. Deliveries of the aircraft to Poland amounted in FY07 to some 78% of the value of FMS deliveries, and in FY08, 82%. However, in 2008, sales to Poland declined in terms of value of exports due to a decrease in deliveries of the F-16s, from 27 in FY07 to 14 in FY08. South Korea has emerged as a big customer through a deal to supply two Aegis Combat Systems valued at almost US$300mn. More controversially, exports to Iraq and Pakistan are of special note as arms exports to each country were banned less than 10 years ago. The ban on sales and aid to Pakistan followed 9/11, with the Bush administrations courting of the volatile state, as an ally in the war on terror. One of the first deals was to supply Pakistan with 36 F-16 aircraft in 2006. FY08 was a bumper year for weapons exports to Pakistan, amounting to US$81mn for communications equipment, 867 TOW antitank missiles in a deal worth more than US$26mn, and 88 155-mm howitzers valued at more than US$25mn. In March 2010, Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said she would seek to expedite arms transfers to Pakistan as part of the Obama administrations revamping of relations with the country. Having begun in FY05, sales to Iraq are on an upward trend which will make it a top recipient of US arms in the coming years. From the start of FY09 October 1 until mid-December 2008 US$11bn of US arms exports had already been concluded. The US is selling arms to as many as 208 countries. These projections, made by the US DoD Defense Security Cooperation Agency , are estimated to be high despite the decline in oil and other commodity prices. Among the big sales are Raytheons and Lockheed Martins Patriot missile defence systems , due mainly to rising demand from several countries needing to respond to the threat from Iran and North Korea. A deal was agreed in December 2009 with Taiwan for Raytheon to supply Patriot missile air and missile defence systems, amounted to US$1bn including US$965mn for technology upgrades for radars, radio systems and US$134mn for spares. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 86 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The DoD is embarking on a naval modernisation programme with Saudi Arabia one of the biggest customers for US arms amounting to US$15-20bn, to include the navys small and agile LCS to counter piracy and for coastal operations. Two separate versions are being made by Lockheed and General Dynamics. Saudi Arabia is also interested in the H-60R Seahawk multi-mission helicopter from Sikorsky Aircraft . From 2004 to 2008, the Israelis bought most of its 102 F-16I combat aircraft and related air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons from the US, mostly as direct transfers as part of military aid to the country from the US. Iraq gets 40% of its defence imports from the US. In 2008, there were orders for 140 M1A1 Abrams tanks and also a stated intention by the Iraqi government to buy advanced combat aircraft and armoured vehicles. By the end of 2008, the DSCA had announced orders to Iraq for several air systems, including Bell Model 407 armed helicopters, M280 rocket launchers and M299 Hellfire guided missile launchers,as well as ancillary equipment and services. The Saudis had already placed orders for US$2bn, 38 M1A1s in July 2006, along with kits and repair parts, communications and support equipment, personnel training and training equipment and technical support services. According to a Congressional Research Service study published in September 2009, the increase in US arms sales is due to the continuation of significant equipment and support services contracts with a broad-based number of US clients globally. Other larger deals with developing nations in 2008 included an air defence system for the UAE worth US$6bn, jet fighters worth US$2bn for Morocco, and attack helicopters for Taiwan worth US$2bn. Reports of record arms exports for 2009 brought some relief to US defence companies, which have been facing up to reductions in their modernisation projects. According to a February 2009 report by US market intelligence firm Standard & Poors, the defence industry environment is likely to stay stable up until and beyond 2010, with the 2009 boom result defying many long-term predictions of decline due to possible defence spending cuts. The global recession and banking crisis did not stop the US from increasing its share in all foreign armaments deals to more than 66% of the world total. The global defence industry has so far been greatly cushioned from the credit crunch and recession due both to the long-term character of the contracts and the US and other countries continuing large government spending budgets. However, cost overruns in key programmes, particularly in Europe, continue to plague the industry, but this is providing some opportunities for increased competition from smaller companies which are more inventive and innovative particularly with regard to creating new technologies. Mergers and acquisitions are likely to continue in 2010, with the bigger players acquiring those innovative smaller companies to fill their own gaps in capabilities. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 87 Industry Trends And Developments United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 In December 2009, aspects of Army modernization and procurement were under a midcourse review by the DoD, the results of which are due in February 2010, focusing mainly on Future Combat Systems . According to the Army Chief of Staff, General Pete Chiarelli, quoted in Aerospace Daily & Defense Report: The Manned Ground Vehicles are not the same today as they were envisioned five or six years ago We have a 360 war. Survivability is not just an issue for tanks and Bradleys. Its an issue weve had to address with the entire force. As for procurement, Chiarelli supported an acquisition approach with faster results: As I look at the amount of time it takes us to move from requirements to a fielded system, does the 1960s-era procurement system really work in todays world? In a meeting with 200 industry representatives in November, he said that the Armys modernisation strategy was based on improving soldiers survivability and to ensure theyre able to maintain a decisive advantage over whatever enemy they face. In December 2009, the Aerospace Industries Association forecast that aerospace sales would achieve a slight growth in 2010, reaching US$214bn in 2010. According to Janes Defence Weekly, military aircraft sales increased by 8% compared with 2008 to US$61bn in 2009 and military aircraft sales are predicted to rise to US$63bn in 2010. The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter programme is due to benefit and there is an expected vastly increased demand by the US military for unmanned aircraft, which has increased sixfold since 2004. Missile sales also increased in 2009, to US$14bn, 11% up on 2008, and expected to increase further to US$16bn in 2010. AIA President Marion Blakey said that despite US aerospace companies facing serious challenges due to the economic downturn, this was not likely to have as great an impact on the aerospace industry compared with other manufacturing sectors. For comparison, three European giants BAE Systems , Thales , Finmeccanica , and EADS comprise the only non-American companies out of the worlds 10 biggest arms manufacturers. In order to gain access to lucrative US defence markets, European companies have acquired US companies. The UKs special relationship with the US has enabled the likes of BAE Systems to conduct a greater proportion of its operations in the US. An exception was the acquisition by Finmeccanica of US military electronics company DRS Technologies in 2008 for US$5bn. The most promising areas of the US defence industry, for much of the current decade and set to dominate the scene in years to come, are IT; communications requiring advanced software systems; and high-tech equipment for field operations. Recent acquisitions of defence IT companies reflect this trend: General Dynamics has acquired Anteon International and Lockheed Martin has acquired Aspen Systems among others. This has partly been driven by US government procurement policies. Smaller specialist companies then arise again from set-asides, which in turn get acquired, and so on. Big US defence companies have also merged most notably Northrop with Grumman in 1994 and Boeing with McDonnell-Douglas in 1997. This is to bring about economies of scale in the face of rapidly rising R&D costs of high-tech Business Monitor International Ltd Page 88 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 weapons systems, the demand for which has largely overtaken previous Cold War needs for military equipment. The moving of troops from Iraq to Afghanistan may benefit companies which provide logistic services, such as transportation equipment and construction of new military bases. Many US contractors in Iraq profited from providing armoured ground vehicles, body armour, support services, ammunition, and logistic and repair services. There may be a renewed boom for these companies with funding made available to repair and replace a host of equipment used in the Iraq war aircraft ground vehicles, and so on. However, other programmes could see their funding and resources diverted to meet the cost of these repairs and replacements. Of the big companies, Raytheon, which makes missiles , will receive an increase in funding for orders of its surveillance systems and reconnaissance units. Northrup Grummans share value increased following the DoD announced request for more navy destroyers. As mentioned previously, while the DoD has cut orders for the Lockheed Martin F22 jet, there is a marked increase in F35 purchases. So a case of, you win some, lose some. Lockheed Martin and the US Navy are looking to opportunities to sell the companys Littoral Combat Ship abroad to their mutual benefit, after the Navy confirmed that it would be buying both classes of the vessel, DodBuzz reported in January 2011. Sales abroad could potentially reduce costs of the programme, which has been beset with various technical and cost problems. Both the Saudi Arabian and Israeli navies are said to be interested in the LCS, which has been described as an attractive platform for the international market by Lockheed officials, who assert that construction of the vessels in the US for export should provide benefits for the US Navy through cost savings. In December 2009, the US Navy awarded Lockheed and Austal USA contracts worth upwards of US$400mn to construct the first of ten vessels to be built by 2015. Lockheed produces the Freedom Class LCS, with Austal making the Independence Class ship. The US plans to purchase around 55 LCSs in the long term, though concerns continue to be raised about the costs of setting up a common combat system for the two classes, as well as over the ships mission modules, which have proved problematic during testing. Boeing Aerospace Operations has been re-awarded its contract to convert commercial aircraft for military use at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, NewsOK reported in January 2011. The contract renewal is worth up to US$25mn, and Boeing has had the contract since 1992, with approximately US$13mn being obligated thus far. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 89 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Even with recent increases in defence procurement within the US, defence firms are far from immune to the downturn, and as US military spending growth is reined in, some will feel the bite in what is a competitive market. As a result, many are looking abroad for growth. In September 2010, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems told employees that it planned to cut 500 jobs by year end as part of a cost-reduction drive, as reported by the Contra Costa Times. The layoffs will mostly be at the firms plants at Redondo Beach, El Segundo and Manhattan Beach and will mainly affect indirect support staff that is, backroom staff rather than those working on government contracts. To avoid further unemployment in the US, it is likely that Congress will not cut the DoD 2010 budget request. Many companies have large backlogs in orders and following a gloomy first part of the year, recovery is predicted in order to fulfil immediate needs. However, there is likely to be a greater political influence on defence spending, given the sheer amounts involved, and much will depend both on the immediate and future state of the economy and on unexpected events which may stretch the US Armed Forces even further. According to the CRS, the growth of US arms sales was not only extraordinary in a time of global recession, but included new arms deals as well as supplying maintenance, upgrades, ammunition and spare parts for US weapons already sold to several nations. This need for upgrades can guarantee a drip-feed supply of materials once original deals are done. Many developing nations have become a prime market and the chance for political influence through arms sales to them. In 2008, US arms sales to developing nations amounted to 70% of the world total, at US$29bn. Growing markets are the UAE, whose deals with all countries came to US$9bn in 2008, Saudi Arabia, total US$8bn; and Morocco, US$5bn. The industry also has to adapt to globalisation, which with contracts involving companies in several countries poses problems of political sensitivity and compromising national security. Demand is increasing for more effective countermeasures against IEDs, particularly in the Afghan theatre, where the continuing, relentless use of roadside bombs by the Taliban removes the need for these insurgency forces to maintain complex logistical support, thereby making the targeting of them infinitely difficult. The need for enhanced C-IED warrants this specific section on robotics technologies, which are designed to reduce the risk to valuable manpower in explosives ordnance disposal operations, as the machines can perform remotely controlled detection, handling and removal, disarming, and dismantlement of a growing range of improvised bombs. Many of the technologies were first pioneered in the 1970s in the UK to counter the IRAs extensive IED campaign, and are now greatly advanced and in wide use by US forces. Robotics is particularly useful for reconnaissance and surveillance, target acquisition and identification. Leading American companies in this sub-sector are iRobot, Qinetiq and Foster-Miller. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 90 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Developments include the race to develop rapidly installed robots with multiple modular adaptations to detect and handle large, deep-buried IEDs. Parts can be attached for excavation of the device. An example is Qinetiqs Bobcat loaders, which can be used remotely to render safe mines of which there are more than 100mn in Afghanistan on building sites. Companies making detection, protection and decontamination equipment are part of a small sector which depends both on Homeland Security and DoD funding, and on how threat levels and events drive the industry onto further R&D. For example, 9/11 and the anthrax 2001 attacks kick started and went on to spawn a burgeoning biodefence protection, detection and therapeutics industry which has received billions of US dollars in funding for new vaccines and drugs. Further and constant requirements for scanning and monitoring equipment at airports, ports and high-profile locations to counter explosives including novel explosives home-made from common compounds as well as CBRN countermeasures equipment, continue to maintain buoyancy in this sector. The big growth area is in orders for IED-resistant armoured trucks. In this rapidly increasing part of the sector there has to be a compromise between mobility and protection against attack. EOD robotics and other equipment to deal with the constant and growing IED threat is in rapidly increased demand not only in Afghanistan but in other conflict areas and for civilian counterterrorist operations in many countries. Land The military has allocated US$23bn to its ground forces in its total funding request for 2011. The military expects to spend US1bn on weapons; US$12bn on support equipment; US$1bn on medium tactical vehicles; US$2bn on combat vehicles; US$4bn on heavy tactical vehicles; US$1bn on light tactical vehicles. The DoD awarded General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products a US$139mn contract to produce HYDRA-70, 2inch aerial rocket systems for the army, air force and navy. The company was the sole bidder for the contract and is expected to complete work by the end of October 2012. In May 2010, Oshkosh Corporation was awarded a US$410mn contract to produce 2,634 medium tactical vehicles, 2,230 trucks and 404 trailers by the end of March 2012. Oshkosh was one of three bidders for the contract. In December 2009, the Army awarded a US$704mn contract for Boeing to construct 21 new CH-47F Chinook aircraft and 14 remanufactured aircraft for delivery in September 2013 and for deployment in Business Monitor International Ltd Page 91 Defence And Procurement Trends And Developments Major New Products And Technical Developments United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Afghanistan. The CH-47F features a new digital avionics and an improved flight control system designed to prevent pilot vision brownout caused by the dust and debris entering the aircraft rotors an important feature for difficult and dusty terrain. In March, Boeing was awarded a US$138mn Army contract to modernise the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss, Texas, with Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles , Class I unmanned air vehicles , as well as unattended ground sensors and a network integration kit, all of which are expected to enhance the teams intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. The equipment will undergo initial operational testing and evaluation in 2011. Surveillance and reconnaissance systems fare high on the US militarys priorities. The US Joint Forces Command is deploying the Valiant Angel system, which adapts civilian surveillance technology through computer servers to enable far more photographs and video footage to be stored than previously. Advanced software will also give field-based intelligence analysts and troops greater and improved access to the vast amounts of video surveillance footage acquired in combat zones. At the Ground Combat Vehicle Industry Day in October 2009, General Chiarelli emphasised the importance of networks for efficient sharing of battlefield information with many different US and allied agencies. He said it will require improvements in compatibility and be one of the most important combat development and acquisition decisions we will make over the next seven years. In September 2009, the US Army stated its intention to develop a new Ground Combat Vehicle as an integral part of FCS programme to bring in ground combat vehicles that are lethal, more survivable, and to able to provide interoperability between crew and platform. To improve its versatility for multi-terrain deployment, the Cougar MRAP from Oshkosh is undergoing modifications to the suspension of the vehicles in use by the US Marines in Iraq. These will make them better adapted for operations, including off-road deployment, in Afghanistan with longer service life. Where the modified independent suspension will provide advantages is in its ability to deflect under-vehicle mine blasts without degrading the MRAPs V-shaped hull. The vehicles base also has an added reinforced blast surface which will retain its blast-deflect design. The US Marine Corps Commandant, General James T Conway, emphasised the need for quality rather than quantity: We want to modify those we have, primarily CAT-I vehicles ... The will get to the field faster, revolutionise MRAP use in the field, and cost less. Enhanced mobility can enable vehicles to avoid attack, but they also have to be heavily armoured, increasing the weight. While heavier versions of the MRAP have encountered problems in both urban and rougher terrain, the MaxxPro MRAP series now includes an upgraded, heavier version than the standard model in order to withstand the growing threat of explosively formed penetrators which can slice through tank Business Monitor International Ltd Page 92 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 armour. All versions are built with a V-hulled armoured body for additional crew protection. By January 2009, more than 6,400 MaxxPros had been ordered to the tune of US$4bn in contracts. Oshkosh, in June 2009, won a US$1bn contract to build at least 2,200 MRAPs for operations in Afghanistan. A lighter version, the M-ATV, weighing 11,339kg, is replacing the old MRAPs. In a definitive move to restructure the Future Combat Systems programme, the Army has installed a new programme executive office to take charge of its Brigade Combat Team Modernization . The US has spent US$26bn on the MRAP vehicle programme since 2006 and the DoD announced the transfer of US$776mn originally earmarked for purchasing MRAPs to an upgrade of existing vehicles. The upgrade focuses on the MRAPs suspension system for the rough terrain of Afghanistan. Oshkosh Corporation is refitting 2,500 Cougar MRAPs and RG-33 MRAPs made by Force Protection and BAE Systems with its TAK-4 suspension system for contracts amounting to US$190mn. As of December 2009, more than 1,500 vehicles had been upgraded by Oshkosh, who won the M-ATV MRAP-lite contract as an emergency stopgap to partially replace the heavy MRAPs until the lighter, more agile Joint Light Tactical Vehicle is ready in 2015. Among the top priorities of the 15-brigade FCS structure is to work out how to incorporate MRAPs and up-armoured Humvees into the 73 new BCT formations. Some of the different types of vehicles in its armoured fleet may be replaced. In December 2009, Janes Defence Weekly said that the Marines were considering an upgrade of the Humvee fleet, rather than buying in new JLTVs, which are deemed too heavy for the Afghan terrain. The JLTV series comprises lightweight, survivable utility vehicles that are intended to replace ageing Humvees, but the Marines are reluctant to buy a JLTV weighing more than 9,000kg. They are being made by several joint teams BAE Systems plus Navistar; Lockheed Martinled plus BAE Systems Mobility and Protection Systems; and General Tactical Vehicles-General Dynamics Land Systems plus AM General. Current models of the Humvee are more heavily armoured than previous lightweight versions, but there is a danger that they will be less mobile and durable. The need for better intelligence systems is pushing forward the major companies R&D programmes. In December 2009, the Army took delivery from General Dynamics of the Prophet Enhanced System tactical signals intelligence system designed for all-senses response to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data throughout the networked battle space. The first system has been integrated onto a Panther command and control vehicle. General Dynamics Land Systems Division in Michigan has also been awarded a US$150mn export contract for 140 M1A1 Abrams tanks for Iraq, with an estimated completion date of May 2011. C-IED systems The US Joint Service EOD Programme is currently fielding a third generation of robotic systems for EOD operatives in the field, having first deployed military robots in Afghanistan in 2002. Robots are designed with interchangeable, modular payloads which can be adapted for many terrains and Business Monitor International Ltd Page 93 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 missions. Several dozen companies make robots and their advanced software, as well as providing training courses for EOD operatives. Robots for military operations are particularly valuable in detecting IEDs in inaccessible and dangerous areas and the growing need for them to safeguard soldiers lives may provide an expanding market, although cost of ordering new systems is always an issue. JIEDDO has deployed the PackBot, which is used to disarm or detonate an IED with its operator staying a safe distance away. Smaller, lighter types of bomb-detection robots are being introduced, as established robots are too heavy for regular soldiers on patrol and convoy missions. However, in February JIEDDO director Lt Gen Michael Oates stated at a Florida conference that of the 50% of IEDs detected by US forces, only 20% are found using currently deployed technological kit, and that around a third of undiscovered bombs are rendered ineffective either by armour, so-called defeat mechanisms, or inadequate construction and execution by the insurgents. Nevertheless, new detection and tagging technology is being developed and of increasing importance are efforts in train to disrupt the supply chain of the insurgents and pre-empt attacks. These involve improving intelligence, winning over local populations, and tracing and severing the mostly informal links of the Taliban bomb-making and smuggling operations a gargantuan task, which extends beyond borders. In January 2010, JIEDDO and the Defense Intelligence Agency set up the Weapons Technical Intelligence Battlefield Forensics, Collections and Exploitation course a new training initiative to improve skills in the Army and Marines in investigation of forensic information gathered following IED attacks. According to JIEDDO the course will integrate surveillance detection, site photography, surroundings observation and characterisation of explosive remnants to understand the enemies and to track the entire chain of IED supply from financiers and bomb makers to emplacers and triggermen. The MRAP demand continues apace, with two further contracts won by BAE Systems in February, the first of which amounts to US$90mn for 58 RG-33 MRAPs to be delivered to US Special Operations Command by September 2010 and to be completed in December 2010. The second contract, worth US$140mn, is for 250 RG-31 Mk5Es, which will include an independent suspension system for enhanced mobility. New suspension systems are also being fitted in theatre on tight schedules, which still may not satisfy the urgent needs to improve MRAPs. In mid-March the Marine Corps awarded a US$178mn contract to Navistar Defense to retrofit hundreds of MRAPs with a new DXM independent suspension system on MaxxPro Dash vehicles. Commencing in April 2010, the refitting is due for completion by March 2011. In February 2010, the US Army was close to a decision on installing a V-shaped hull on the Stryker vehicle for enhanced protection against roadside IED. This will bring it to the protection level of the latest MRAP vehicles. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 94 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Explosive-impact tests in March demonstrated an MRAP-equivalent level of blast protection in the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle . The Marine Corps were due to receive seven of the new EFV prototypes later in 2010, but initial low-rate production of the vehicles has led to delays until 2015. In April 2009, the US Army published the Robotics Strategy white paper to provide the groundwork in EOD robotics, having used these technologies in the field for several years. In the process of evolving an IT and robotics doctrine, the main immediate aim is for the technology-enabled human. Apart from improving C-IED operations, advanced robotics are planned for routine tasks where full-time human intervention is not necessary, such as surveillance of bases, and to using unattended ground sensors or advanced sensors for mobile, stand-off reconnaissance. Sea A total of US$25bn is expected to be spent on shipbuilding and maritime systems by the US military domestically and internationally in 2011. Of the total amount, US$6bn has been allocated for submarine expenditure; US$12bn for surface expenditure; US$2bn for technology development; US$2bn for support; US$800mn for support ships; US$300mn for outfitting and post delivery. In September 2010, Boeing reported that it had been awarded a US$5bn, three-year contract by the US Navy to build 124 new fighter jets, as reported by AFP. According to the agreement, Boeing will supply 66 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and 58 EA-18-G Growlers to the force. The Growler, an electronic warfare aircraft will replace the EA-6B Prowler, and can be carrier or airfield-based. The Super Hornet is a multirole carrier-based fighter aircraft which has been in use more than a decade Boeing has delivered more than 430 to the Navy since its launch. According to company officials, the Super Hornet can perform virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum. Boeing has said that the contracts multi-year structure helps the Navy take advantage of the firms production efficiencies, saving more than US$600mn for the government a significant figure in straightened fiscal times. The substantial procurement of carrier-based aircraft indicates that the Navy still places a lot of importance on aircraft carriers, which increase a countrys ability to project power far overseas, as well as to respond to crises in areas where it has little ground force presence. China, increasingly seen as the USs major long-term strategic rival, is expected to launch its first carrier around 2015, and the US, though it still has much greater military capacity, and particularly scope to intervene overseas, than the Peoples Republic, is likely to be anxious to stay ahead of the game in keeping its carrier fleet well-equipped. In September 2010, brahmand.com reported that Austal had started construction of the first new USNS Vigilant join high speed vessel for the US Navy at its shipyard in Alaska. The JHSV will be deployed for rapid intra-theatre transportation of troops and military vehicles and equipment. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 95 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 USNS Vigilant will be a 338-feet long unit with 727 tonnes overall displacement and a 600 tonne cargo capacity and an average speed of 35 knots. It will replace slower, smaller transport vessels for both the Army and Navy. Vigilant will be the second unit in its class, following the USAV Spearhead , which is due to be delivered to the Army by 2012. Following the Navys Strategic and Theater Sealift Programme , the Programme Executive Office Ships procures vessels for both the Navy and US Army, and is responsible for the development and acquisition of Navy surface vessels. It is currently overseeing the design and construction of ten major classes of surface ship, as well as smaller craft. In June 2010, Bell Helicopter Textron was awarded a US$546mn contract by the Naval Air Systems Command to produce 29 UH-1Y and AH1Z helicopters. The Marine Corps will receive 18 new UH-1Y aircraft, nine reconstructed AH-1Z aircraft and two new AH-1Z aircraft under the deal by July 2013. In March 2010, General Dynamics NASSCO won two contracts worth US$824mn from the US Navy to construct two Lewis and Clark-class cargo ships, the Medgar Evers and TAKE 14. The Evers ships are due for completion in December 2013 and the T-AKE 14 by November 2014. In March 2009, the US Navy ordered from Raytheon the AGM-145C-1 JSOW , which with its two-way datalink system is said by Raytheon to become, when it enters naval service in 2010, the first network-enabled weapon to be deployed anywhere in the world. Raytheon is also working with Japan and the government department responsible for BMD deployments, the US Missile Defense Agency, on the development of an interceptor missile, the Block 1A and upgraded version the Block 1AA, for use at sea. The Japanese, who are closely collaborating with the US on BMD for their own protection against North Korean missiles, have used the Aegis BMD system to detect, track and destroy a target in mid course, and have Raytheon missiles on its Kongou-class destroyers. In September 2009, the US Navy approved the Shipboard Protection System , an initiative to provide navy vessels with an enhanced force protection against asymmetric threats. The system is designed to coordinate, command-and-control personnel, onboard equipment, sensors and software. It is intended to provide a multi-directional, fully integrated and seamless sensor, analysis and response system to counter asymmetric threats with no increase in manpower. Air The US is looking to spend a total of US$55bn on aircraft expenditure in 2011, according to figures released by the Department of Defence. Of the amount, US$4bn is allocated for aircraft technology development; US$15for aircraft modification; US$4bn on unmanned aerial vehicles; US$3bn on Business Monitor International Ltd Page 96 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 support aircraft; US$10bn on combat aircraft; US$12bn on cargo aircraft; US$4bn on aircraft support. The DoD awarded Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation a US$303mn deal in May 2010 to produce four Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft. The aircraft include two Block 30 and two Block 40 vehicles, while the contract also includes support services. The DoD ordered a new Beechcraft King Air B350 aircraft from Hawker Beechcraft Corporation in May 2010, which is excepted to be delivered by April 2011. The Boeing Company won an order for 10 Egyptian Block II Apache AH-64D helicopters in the same month, which are also expected to be delivered by April 2011. Bell Helicopter Textron won a US$20mn contract to deliver up to two Bell Helicopter 412 EP aircraft in late-April 2010. The aircraft will be mostly constructed in Canada and are expected to be completed around October 2012. In late February 2010, the USAF announced the first flight of the KC-X refuelling tanker is planned for 2012 and is expected to be flying refuelling missions by 2017. Four test aircraft are due to be purchased following the latest restart of a US$35bn competition and will be modified into production aircraft. The first seven new tankers are scheduled for construction in 2013, with the first delivery due in 2015. In March, the bidding war for the KC-X intensified with EADS considering a bid against its arch-rival Boeing, having earlier dropped out of the running. Meanwhile, an unexpected new competitor, Russia's state firm UAC, is planning to bid as well. The competition heated up following the DoDs indication it would extend the deadline into May, before it decides who will supply the replacement for the older Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. The bid for the new refuelling tanker contract has been surrounded by scandal. Having together won the contract in February 2008, Northrop Grumman and EADS were turned down following a successful appeal to the investigative arm of the US Congress by Boeing, which was then awarded the contract. This sparked angry responses from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who accused the US administration of favouring a solely American contractor. The DoD had earlier suspended a contract awarded to Boeing in 2003 when an ethics scandal emerged, which involved a Boeing executive and a USAF official, who was later convicted of criminal conspiracy. Surveillance systems are rapidly gaining importance in the industry. Raytheon was awarded an initial US$886mn USAF contract to develop a new Global Positioning System element to improve the accuracy of satellite data. Its service-oriented architecture is aimed at integrating open-system standards of government and industry. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 97 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Also in March, Northrop Grumman was awarded a US$223mn contract to supply the USAF with new four Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engines for its E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft. The engines will form the integral part of two JSTARS propulsion pod shipsets, which will each contain pylon assemblies and related system interconnections. In providing increased power and fuel economy, the engines will fulfil USAF plans to give the JSTARS aircraft the capability to fly at higher altitudes, as well as remain on station for longer periods and take off from shorter runways . Lockheed Martin received a US$171mn low-rate initial production contract from Northrop Grumman in March, to produce four airborne AN/APY-9 early warning radars and support systems for the Navy's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. The APY-9 radars advantage over its predecessor is its higher power, longer range solid-state transmitter and increased sensitivity from its digital receivers. LM claims the UHF radar can detect arrays of smaller targets at a greater range in coastal regions and over land, and that it enables operators to focus the radar on areas of interest. In December 2009, Raytheon won a US$1bn contract from US Army Aviation and Missile Command to produce Patriot air and missile defence systems for Taiwan, to include advances in remote launch communication system and radar. Also at the end of 2009, Boeing was awarded a US$750mn contract for the continued engineering and design support of 76 B-52H Stratofortress strategic bombers as a means of maintaining operational capability until it leaves service in 2040. The contract covers upgrade of its targeting software for sensors and radar. In September 2009, it was estimated that the first of two armed KC-130J aircraft are due to be in Afghanistan by November, equipped with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment and armed with wing-mounted Hellfire missiles. Despite its upgraded systems, refuelling will remain the aircrafts primary mission. Eventually, the Marine Corps plans to buy nine Harvest Hawk kits three for each of the three active-duty KC-130J squadrons. In March 2009, the USAF awarded a contract to Raytheon to rebuild its existing laser-guided AGM-65 Maverick missiles to the upgraded AGM-65E2. This order is expected to fulfil the need by USAF for a close-air-support precision weapon to counter rapidly moving targets. The Saudis signed a deal with Raytheon in March 2009 for the US giant to supply 150 AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles for the Saudis F-15 fighter aircraft. Raytheon went from strength to strength in 2008, sealing contracts with Finland, Kuwait, Morocco, Singapore and South Korea for over 800 AMRAAM missiles. A special division of General Dynamics, Ordnance and Tactical Systems , conducted successful air-drop tests of a new missile guidance system, sponsored by the US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center in late 2008. The system will enable existing ground-launched Business Monitor International Ltd Page 98 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 mortars to be modified to a more lightweight version for use on the Armys UAVs . In September 2008, the US Armys Aviation and Missile Command awarded contracts on competitive terms to Lockheed Martin and an industry team from Raytheon-Boeing to develop the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile , worth US$125mn and US$122mn respectively, in a programme costing US$7bn. Final selection to procure 35,000 JAGMs will be made by end 2010. The JAGM is intended as a replacement of several USAF missiles TOW, Hellfire and Maverick carried on helicopters, UAVs and attack aircraft. With a range of more than 20km, the JAGM will be at least twice the current Hellfire range, with extra propulsion provided by a single insensitive-munitions rocket motor that can work in extreme conditions to reach a maximum range from all the deployable platforms.

Source: BMI Although not official, the classified McChrystal report in September was reported as requesting up to 40,000 troops from NATO, most of which would come from the US. Approximately 30,000 are being dispatched to Afghanistan in H110. As the main ally of the US with the second largest force serving in Business Monitor International Ltd Page 100 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Afghanistan, and following General McChrystals request for more troops in September, the UKs military proposed to send an additional 1,000 troops, bringing Britains troop contribution to 10,000. US ground forces have increased by more than 92,000 in recent years, but according to Official Army statistics released in March, the percentage of troops declared unavailable for combat has risen since 2007, from 11% to 16% of each brigade. According to US Army Vice-Chief of Staff Gen. Peter Chiarelli, repeated deployments and health problems are the chief reasons, along with the recommendation that troops should be given longer periods between deployments citing a brigade which had only 4% fewer troops to deploy after having had 28 months to recuperate. Soldiers remaining out of theatre are assigned home base posts, such as training other troops or receiving additional training themselves. To support operations, the Central Intelligence Agency is increasing its 700-strong presence in Afghanistan, which consists of agents, analysts and paramilitary operatives, and will make the deployment the agencys largest ever station. McChrystal, in his September 2009 report requested enhanced intelligence on the Taliban to pre-empt its growing number of IED attacks. CIA personnel roles include teaming up with special ops in the pursuit of high-value targets; monitoring public Afghan response and allegiances to track pro-Taliban support, especially in provinces already moving closer to them; and collecting intelligence on Afghan corruption. As of August 2009, the DoD announced that retention of active and reserve personnel continues to be very strong in all four Active Component Services. BMI estimates that US defence spending totalled US498bn in 2010, by some way the biggest defence budget in the world. However, defence outlay fell 24% from 2009 in nominal terms and down 25% in constant price terms, though it should be noted that spending rose 7% in 2009 and 10% in 2008 as stimulus measures took effect and the demands of the military surge in Iraq were felt. Defence expenditure equalled US$1,610 per head in 2010, and 3% of GDP, well above the 2% target recommended by NATO, the military alliance of which the US is the leading member, and accounted for 17% of government expenditure, down from 18% in 2009 but still a high proportion for a developed country. As some fiscal savings have been made, defence has taken a bigger hit than average, reflecting other priorities for the Obama administration, not least health care. In 2011 BMI expects defence spending to rise 2% to US$509bn, or US$1,630 per capita, as the US economy recovers and medium-term fiscal loosening continues to take effect. Defence will rise as a proportion of government expenditure, to 17%, though it will remain at 3% of GDP. Over the forecast period, to 2015, we expect steady nominal terms defence spending growth as the US invests steadily in its armed forces. In constant price terms, expenditure will rise to 1% in 2011 and to 3in 2015. Spending is likely to remain at 3% of GDP, but rise steadily as a proportion of government spending to 19% in 2019.

Source: SIPRI, BMI This reflects the expectation that the US will continue to ensure that its military retains a cutting edge in a world in which new threats are emerging, and in which China, potentially a major strategic rival, is set to overtake it as the worlds largest economy between 2019 and 2025, depending on which forecast is used. It also indicates that defence spending growth will outstrip broader public spending expansion, an indicator of the importance that the country places on defence and security. By 2019 BMI expects US defence spending to total US$661bn, or US$1,975 per capita. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 102 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 There are both upside and downside factors that could affect this outlook. Defence expenditure may rise higher if the US becomes embroiled in another overseas conflict, for example with Iran or North Korea, although Washington would be loath to become involved in another bloody ground war abroad. Furthermore, a serious terrorist attack could lead to higher security spending and potential involvement abroad. If the US perceives China as becoming more belligerent, it might increase its military presence in East Asia, for example in South Korea and in the seas around, and perhaps in Central Asia. Deployments, even peaceable ones, could incur higher costs. On the other hand, should the US economic recovery be reversed a possibility that cannot be ruled out there would be fewer resources to invest in the military. The US is arguably over-dependent on Chinese economic growth and Chinas willingness to buy US Treasuries and should these pillars of support prove fragile, the outcome for the US economy could be serious. It was forecast that the vast increase in defence spending that occurred during the Bush administration would not continue under the Obama administration, but this was before the December 2009 budget approval. The Quadrennial Defense Review published in February 2010 vastly expands the missions of the military. The request for the FY2011 defence budget is higher than at any point since World War II. There is more than US$200bn requested, an increase of 8%, to fund operations and maintenance , which could include funding an extra 22,000 troops for current operations, together with an extra war budget allocation of US$89bn for O&M resources. Expenditure on ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are expected to account for US$159bn of the bill in 2011. Moreover, significant sums of supplemental requests ought to be expected in 2011, taking total defence spending even closer to the countrys World War II historical peak. The total requested for research, development, test and evaluation for FY2011 is US$76bn, down from US$80bn in 2010. The typical sector breakdown has been maintained in the amount requested for 2011, with the air force allocated US$27bn, defence agencies allocated US$20bn, the navy allocated US$17bn and the army US$10bn. Aircraft expenditure will continue to increase in 2011, with the majority of funding going to procurement. The DoD said in February 2010 that increased funding will allow it to pursue procurement of a number of aircraft, including the V-22 and the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as the Navys F/A-18 and E/A-18G. A total of US$55bn has been requested for aircraft expenditure in 2011: US$11bn on command, control, communications and computers; US$23bn on ground forces; US$9bn on missile defence; US$12bn on munitions and missiles; US$25bn on shipbuilding; and, US$9bn on space-based systems. A total of US$6bn has been requested for the National Guard and reserve equipment for 2011, down from US$8bn enacted in 2010. The majority of this, US$5bn, is allocated to army expenditure, with US$98mn allocated for navy expenditure and US$769mn allocated for air force expenditure. A Business Monitor International Ltd Page 103 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 total of US$55bn has been requested for active army military personnel costs for 2011, slightly up from 2010s total of US$55bn. Given the straitened fiscal situation, and fears that the military budget could get out of control, Defence Secretary Robert Gates has proposed a range of cost-saving measures. These aim to hold down budget growth without cutting into the armed forces. Most controversial of Gates proposals is to eliminate the Joint Forces Command in Virginia, as reported by CNN in September 2010. The Command is composed of men from the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines trained and equipped to work together and to respond to the needs of other fighting commands. It emerged from the old Atlantic Command. Some senators have questioned whether the effects of scrapping the Command have been properly analysed by the Defense Department, and whether its abolition is necessary. Gates has a range of other propositions for cost-restraint. These include scrapping some of the 65 military boards and commissions to reduce the budget allocated to them by 25% in the 2011 fiscal year; eliminating duplication in the department; disbanding the departments Business Transformation Agency ; cutting the budget for service support contractors; a job freeze in certain divisions; and an end to brass creep which sees high ranking officers doing tasks that could be done by lower ranking troops. After the drawdown of US troops in Afghanistan, expenditure should be US$525bn in 2012. BMI expects spending to increase in the subsequent two years, although it will not take a greater share of GDP. Expenditure in 2013 should reach US$541bn and US$559bn by 2014 . The major challenges faced by the Obama administration will still have a direct impact on procurement. These are the ongoing quagmire of the Afghan operations, managing drawdown in Iraq while maintaining Iraqi security, and preparing for current and future threats from nation states as well as non-state actors during a prolonged recession that is set to continue in 2010 despite some signs of recovery. There is a pressing need for the administration to modernise the armed forces for example, some USAF aircraft are more than 23 years old, with many transport aircraft and aerial refuelling tankers more than 40 years old. The defence industry will have to rapidly adapt to new government policies of procurement, regulation, recapitalisation and management and funding of programmes. As ever, it is difficult to predict where the next flashpoints are and what demands future conflicts will place on the industry, depending on political decisions. Among 33 countries, the US gets the least equipment per dollar spent on defence, according to a survey by McKinsey & Co. Having examined the performance within all-forces personnel, maintenance and procurement of each country, the survey report, published in March 2010, claimed that countries that make it a point to support their domestic defence industries have higher procurement costs than those that rely on imports. Countries that procure older equipment from the global market tend to have very capable Business Monitor International Ltd Page 104 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 fleets for less money. The US tied with Australia at the foot of the league, each scoring 17 out of 100 for lowest in equipment output per dollar spent. Much depends not so much on how policies will affect which weapons programmes will be prioritised, and how they will impinge on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, despite this level of unpredictability, it is a given that the US is committed to a level of defence expenditure, which is largely independent of the economic state of the country. The experience of 9/11 has more or less guaranteed that military capabilities must be maintained to deal with security threats at home and abroad, and that the war on terror will continue to occupy resources. It was thought that there would be delays on larger weapons programmes that cost the most in funding and take longest to come to fruition, but the effects of the economic crisis may be only temporary and not a significant threat to the industry. However, the government will have to balance possible relative cuts in expenditure with the need to continue pursuing the War on Terror. If defence programmes, which are increasing in complexity and are on longer and longer timelines to completion, are axed many jobs are likely to be lost at a time of high unemployment. Losing skills in the workplace also means a revival is harder in terms of recruiting high-tech personnel. Critics from the rightwing Heritage Foundation said that whole programmes are being slashed and that plans to purchase new aircraft, ships, combat vehicles and missile defence systems are being made for delivery many years ahead, at which time paying for them will be a future administrations problem. This analysis is directed not only at the current administration but also the previous one, which cut 100 procurement programmes. The fear is that the US industrial base has not been maintained or expanded and adapted to support future defence needs. There may be changes to how much congress funds expenditure on the two major wars through supplemental appropriation, such as July 2007, when out of US$120bn in new funding, US$99bn was appropriated for the DoD. Of that, US$94bn was appropriated for military operations, US$1bn for military construction, and US$3bn for realignment and closure of military bases. It is possible these extra appropriations will not be so plentiful in coming years, and that extra expenditure will come from the base defence budget. This may affect the funding available for the big weapons programmes. Impact On Procurement Having made a significant amount of profit during the Bush years, the large US defence companies were expected to be able to withstand a deceleration in government defence expenditure. These profits have helped to restore balance sheets and to improve company operations. Most notably in the US, the companies have a very varied customer base of several contract-awarding military services and intelligence agencies. Major programmes also use a large number of diverse contractors, thus spreading the burden of cuts in the defence budget or programme delays to smaller firms, who are the ones which will suffer most.

Source: UN Comtrade, BMI A report published in January 2010 by the Congressional Budget Office , Long-Term Implications of the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Budget, indicates that the DoD budget for 2010 will exceed its real dollar equivalent during the massive defence build-up during the 1980s. Of course, US forces were not engaged in any major contingency operations during the otherwise tumultuous endgame of the Cold War and so todays budget is bound to be higher because of ongoing combat missions. Of significance is the CBO projection that the average DoD budget for FY2011-FY2028 will be US$50bn less in real terms than its current FY10 estimate. This projection includes costs for which, according to the CBO, the Obama Administration has not fully accounted. Future defence budgets are estimated as averaging some US$91bn less a year in real dollars than for the current, FY10 stated defence budget as submitted to Congress by the US administration. The report also claims that spending is higher to help recovery from what it terms the procurement holiday of the 1990s, when all three military services were cut, the buying in of modern equipment reduced, and defence spending dropped to less than 3% of GDP. As the military is engaged in at least one war, operations and support, which includes pay for the troops and operations and maintenance, takes up a lot of funding. In the FY10 defence budget request, these commitments will absorb just about 65% of the DoD budget , Also, as the operations in the GWOT are ongoing, and may spread elsewhere to other fronts the conflict necessitates the constant restoration of lost and damaged weapons and equipment. Therefore, despite a healthy defence budget for 2010, it is most likely that Obama will prioritise costs of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan and that the industry will have to fulfil those needs possibly Business Monitor International Ltd Page 107 Table: US Defence Trade Balance, 2008-2015 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 at the expense of more ambitious, futuristic hi-tech projects and blue sky projects, or systems which are intended to meet threats that are not immediate. Equipment marked as top priority is for the operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and continue to include armoured vehicles, most notably new versions of MRAPs, and UAVs used for combat, reconnaissance and surveillance missions. One change afoot is the reduction of procurement costs to the government. It is possible that this will result in more stringent conditions for making awards to companies, which will mean they would have to take more risks for lower profit margins. Other factors include decisions to replace or renew contracts for equipment whose production runs are nearing completion, such as the giant long-range USAF C-17 cargo aircraft. If renewal contracts do not materialise, companies or company divisions may have to close down their complex supply chains, meaning a loss of jobs and smaller firms going to the wall. Other leading generals have reinforced the point that the US and UK armed forces involved in present and future conflicts will need smarter weapons and fewer tanks, jets and surface ships. Military head of the British Army, General Sir David Richards, in September 2009 told Chatham House in London that the changing nature of warfare means fewer conventional wars and more wars on terrorism and insurgencies, using asymmetric tactics and technology to defeat conventional capabilities. This means that there will be a growing demand to fulfil the needs of these conflicts non-kinetic effects, counter-IED technologies and training, information dominance, counter-piracy and means to counter cyberterrorism. This would require governments funding campaigns against new threats and rebalancing their investments to be effective. The recent decision to curtail the BMD programme will likely make spending on missile defence one of the casualties of the current period. So far this has amounted to some US$10bn a year, funding several programmes conducted mainly by the big hitters most notably Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Orbital Sciences and ATK. There will, however, be a degree of continuity of programmes funding carried over from the previous administration, such as plans to increase manpower numbers of the army and marines by at least 90,000 troops in total and to enhance force protection through more orders for armoured vehicles and personal protective equipment. Somewhere Between A Crisis And A Recovery The US second-half slowdown is under way, and is likely to continue into 2011. We have slightly revised down our 2010 and 2011 real GDP forecasts, primarily reflecting base effects from revisions in past data. Base effects from already severely depressed levels are the major reason we are not calling for an outright double-dip recession, but the US faces a recession in all but name. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 108 Macroeconomic Outlook United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 For 2010 our forecast has changed to 2% from 2%, due primarily to revisions in past data and a poor second quarter which, combined, have reduced the base effects for the full year. We have not changed our core scenario for a second-half slowdown to a pace of real GDP growth in the 1-1% area, which would leave full year 2010 growth at 2% . Momentum is clearly relenting, with Q409 representing the growth peak at 5% q-o-q annualised, followed by 3% and 1% in the subsequent two quarters. For 2011 we are revising our forecast slightly lower, to 1% from 1%. Both of these forecasts remain below the Bloomberg consensus estimates of 3% for 2010 and 2% for 2011. Our expectation of weak long-term growth beyond this period, at around 2%, has not changed. Market expectations for a return to trend growth, as implied by these consensus estimates, appear to us to be unfounded. In order for this to occur, we would need to see the growth baton passed successfully from the government to the private sector. There are no signs as yet that this has taken or is taking place. As it stands, inventory rebuilding and fiscal stimulus have made the greatest part of their contribution in this economic cycle. Beginning in H210 and into 2011, we see these factors as being headwinds rather than tailwinds. Underlying final demand growth will need to be strong in order to offset these headwinds, and there are few signs that this is the case. The primary factors behind our view that the post-recession period would be characterised by sluggish growth have not abated: households continue to deleverage, employment growth is not nearly strong enough, and deflation, not inflation, is the dominant trend. We continue to expect flat to negative growth in household debt for the foreseeable future, high levels of unemployment , and core CPI to remain very low for an extended period. No Evidence Of A Double-Dip...Yet Clearly, we are not optimistic going into 2011. But we are cautious at the moment about calling a full-fledged double dip recession. The best reason not to expect another recession is simply that many components of GDP are at or near such low levels that it is difficult to see how they would make significant negative contributions in future quarters. The accompanying chart shows the three key cyclical elements of GDP equipment & software investment, durable goods consumption, and residential construction. Growth in these categories of GDP typically helps lead the US out of recession. Taken as an aggregate, these three items have fallen from 23% of GDP to a post-war low of 16%, and are only slowly rebounding. While we expect something of a relapse in H210 for residential construction, after the expiration of government tax credits for first-time buyers, the biggest damage has already been done. We also note that in terms of fixed investment as a whole, our annual real growth rates of 5-7% over the next five years may seem ambitious in the context of real GDP growth in the low 2% range. In fact, it means that real investment would only return to 2006 levels by 2014. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 109 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 We point out also that the surprising increase in real imports in the first half of this year, which resulted in a post-war record negative contribution of 4percentage points to growth in Q210 , is almost certain to abate in H210. There is little momentum behind growth, so the odds of a second technical recession in the coming quarters are not low, but they are less than 50-50, in our view. Put simply, so much damage has already been done that the arithmetic makes it unlikely that there will be a second, full-fledged recession in the near future. But in this respect the US's next few years are going to be characterised by a 'growth recession' and potentially periodic contractions, rather than a full-blown economic crisis a la 2008-09. A Recession In All But Name? That said, we believe that the underlying dynamics of the economy will resemble a recession in all but name. We have reached the point where dismal incoming data is somehow treated as a sign that the economy is in full recovery mode. A fall in the level of weekly initial jobless claims by a few thousand is seen as a positive indicator for employment, even though it remains in the high 400,000s area, which is compatible with the worst periods of previous recessions. Major surveys such as the PMI and ISM indicate a degree of corporate optimism, and major publicly-listed corporations are enjoying record profits, but the confidence of small businesses, which make up about half of the private economy and employment, remains in crisis territory. The steadying unemployment rate belies the high underemployment rate and the fact that there is the same number of private sector jobs now as there were in 1999, and the employment-to-population ratio remains near 30-year lows at 58%. Even the flattening yield curve is taken as a positive in several major leading indicator indices, whereas the real reason for the flattening is that disinflation and low policy rates over the coming years are increasingly regarded as a given. We give these examples to illustrate the point that the headline numbers may not look so dismal, but with the economy growing at much less than trend, it will feel like a recession. Risks To Outlook At zero growth in H210, full-year 2010 growth would come out at 2%. This is not entirely implausible, although as we have said, given the very low base effects, it is not likely either. As evidence of economic slowdown continues to mount, the other risk comes from official policy. The question is what fiscal and monetary ammunition is left to exercise, and whether it would be enough to get the economy back on its feet. Our position is that the Federal Reserve has little room to manoeuvre, as incoming indicators will not look so bad that members will want to ease policy, but also not so good that they will want to tighten it. We do not expect Fed funds rates hikes until 2012 at the earliest in any case. From a fiscal standpoint, there appears to be waning appetite for another round of stimulus as Congress appears deadlocked ahead of the midterm elections in November. As for the efficacy of such stimulatory measures, we do not believe that there is much the authorities can do to solve the underlying dynamic of Business Monitor International Ltd Page 110 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 households deleveraging and rebuilding their balance sheets. Record government stimulus and all-time low interest rates have not been enough so far and there is little evidence that further pursuit of these policies will be able to lift the US economy out of sub-trend growth. A swift or premature withdrawal of easy policy, however, would be enough for us to lower our growth forecasts. We are already concerned about cutbacks on the state and local levels, which are looking like they could be quite severe in coming quarters as governments below the federal level struggle to close budget gaps.

Boeing is looking to India as a lucrative market, with contracts that could be worth at least US$20bn in the next few years for tactical aircraft, maritime patrol, heavy lift helicopters, tactical transport aircraft, attack helicopters and possibly airborne early warning systems. Defence secretary Robert Gates has announced major reform of ITAR, which may help increase sales in medium to long term if implemented.

The increase in revenues was largely on the back of growth in the companys defence, space and security segment, as well as stronger commercial deliveries. Overall, net income for the year was slashed in two to US$1bn, down from US$2bn in 2008. The companys defence, space and security division saw revenue firm by 5% y-o-y to US$33bn in 2009, up from US$32bn in 2008. Revenue from military aircraft sales alone increased by 6% y-o-y to US$14bn, up from US$13bn in the previous year. In Q209, revenues were up 2% to US$33bn. Meanwhile, in Q209 revenues in commercial aircraft fell 2% to US$8bn. Sales for integrated defence systems, including military aircraft were up 9% to US$8bn. Meanwhile, Boeing and its main competitor, EADS-controlled Airbus Industries, have both struggled with lower demand for freighters and passenger aircraft because of the depressed international market. Boeing official Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, stressed that things remain difficult. He said: Were going into the worst part of the year itll be a pretty tough next four to six months, but in 2010 therell be a bounce back. Boeing, like the rest of the defence industry, needs international markets as it faces multiple challenges in the domestic US defence sector. The predicted new era of contracts with India was heralded by a deal earlier in 2009 for eight P-8 Poseidon long-range maritime patrol aircraft worth US$2bn. The company faces stiff competition from Lockheed Martin and EADS, which are also making inroads into the Indian market. Latest Activity The US has one of the most advanced aerospace industries in the world. In civil aviation, Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer Boeing has for years been the leading global producer of large aeroplanes. Over the next five to 10 years, Boeings competitive fate will depend on whether its vision of the future of aviation one in which airlines will require smaller, speedier aircraft that fly point-to-point more frequently, is correct. It is gearing its product range to this scenario, having in the last decade launched the long range Boeing 777 and the smaller 737 Next Generation, and now focusing on the 747, a 200-250 seat plane built of lightweight carbon fibre, and designed to be 20% more fuel efficient, with a 10% overall reduction in operating costs. Airbus is also aiming for that kind of low-cost budget airline market, staking much of its future on the A380, a superjumbo . Airbus thinks world airlines will require almost 1,150 superjumbos by 2020, while Boeing puts demand in the same period at no more than 320. Meanwhile, in the military field, Boeing revenues are being impacted by cuts to procurement budgets. Some programmes have been cancelled, including Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles for the army, the VH-71 presidential helicopter, and CSAR-X search-and-rescue helicopter. The MGVs were cancelled before production began. Designed as speedy and lightly-armoured vehicles, they were intended to reduce manned vehicle vulnerability as an integral part of a Future Combat Systems communications network of small ground robots, aerial drones, guided missiles. The whole FCS Business Monitor International Ltd Page 113 Financial Performance United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 programme was to be constructed, for US$92bn, by Boeing and SAIC. In September 2010, Boeing reported that it had been awarded a US$5bn, three-year contract by the US Navy to build 124 new fighter jets, as reported by AFP. According to the agreement, Boeing will supply 66 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and 58 EA-18-G Growlers to the force. The Growler, an electronic warfare aircraft will replace the EA-6B Prowler, and can be carrier or airfield-based. The Super Hornet is a multirole carrier-based fighter aircraft which has been in use more than a decade Boeing has delivered more than 430 to the Navy since its launch. According to company officials, the Super Hornet can perform virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum. In January 2009, the US Navy took delivery of more than 380 Super Hornet advanced multi-role strike fighters. Also, in 2008, Boeing conducted the final assembly and testing of first five P-8A Poseidon aircraft for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Boeing was also awarded a Navy contract in April 2009 to develop the Free Electron Laser weapon system. In September 2008, the US Armys Aviation and Missile Command awarded contracts on competitive terms to Lockheed Martin and an industry team from Raytheon-Boeing to develop the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile , worth US$125mn and US$122mn respectively, in a programme costing US$7bn. Final selection to procure 35,000 JAGMs will be made by end 2010. In November 2009, the US Air Force Research Laboratory awarded Boeing a contract for the first phase of a project to demonstrate miniature weapon technology for deployment of the Joint Direct Attack Munition and Small Diameter Bomb on unmanned aerial vehicles . Technologies for the project include avionics, guidance and control, and mission planning systems. In January 2010, the company was awarded a five-year In-Service Support contract worth around US$600mn for the 737 Airborne Early Warning and Control , part of Australia's Project Wedgetail programme. Boeing will provide programme management, integration and engineering services for the Australian Air Forces fleet of six Wedgetail AEW&C aircraft. The bidding war for the KCX air refuelling tanker also intensified in March 2010 with European defence company EADS and the Russian state firm UAC both considering bidding against Boeing. The DoD extended the bid deadline into May to decide which company will supply the replacement for the Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. Also, in March, Boeing was awarded a US$138mn Army contract to modernise the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss, Texas, with Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles and Class I unmanned air vehicles . Of considerable significance for logistical operations in Afghanistan, the US has begun using Boeing 747-400 freightliners to airlift M-ATV armoured vehicles into theatre. The company announced in late-June 2010 that it is to acquire defence firm Argon ST in a US$775mn deal. Boeing said it believes the acquisition will add to its communications, sensors and information management capacities, Reuters reported. Argon ST is a manufacturer of communications technology for military jets and submarines. In May 2010, the company won an order for 10 Egyptian Block II Apache AH-64D helicopters from the DoD, which are expected to be delivered by April 2011. Boeing Aerospace Operations has been re-awarded its contract to convert commercial aircraft for Business Monitor International Ltd Page 114 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 military use at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. The contract renewal is worth up to US$25mn, and Boeing has had the contract since 1992, with approximately US$13mn being obligated thus far. Prior Activity Boeing was founded in 1916 and the company built the first modern airliner, the 247, in the 1930s, as well as the first commercial jet airliner, the 707, in 1959. Other notable models include the 747, in 1970 and the 777 in 1994. In the defence sector, the company is famous for the B-2 bomber and B-52 Stratofortress, while it also developed short-range missile technology which was adapted for ICBMs. Boeing has also played important roles in the Apollo programme; making the NASA space shuttle and International Space Station and various satellites. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 115 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Strengths Combat Systems group is world leader in making and maintaining land and expeditionary combat systems. General Dynamics is also the worlds main submarine manufacturer and is a major player in aerospace. Growing demand for IT and mission-support services for both the US military and security forces at home and abroad. The companys Combat and Marine Systems divisions saw sales grow strongly in 2009. Weaknesses In May 2009, shares fell by 5% after a downgrading of the company due to falling demand for business jets, comprising threat to Gulfstream programme (although this may recover post-recession) which accounts for 15-20% of company revenues and affected Q109 results. 80% of revenues are tied to defence spending, which is expected to grow overall, but may suffer blips during current administration. The companys exports are restrained by the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations . Opportunities Expected to benefit from rise in core defence spending by 2-4% from 2009 to 2014. Defence secretary Robert Gates has announced major reform of ITAR, which may help increase sales in medium to long term if implemented. Threats As with other defence companies, possible decline in contracts due to volatile economic situation and possible temporary decline in government spending on defence threatens cancellation or curtailment of programmes. Funding for combat systems division programmes may be cut, such as the Army Stryker combat vehicle and upgrades to the Abrams tank. Company Overview Financial Performance Business Monitor International Ltd Page 116 General Dynamics As well as business aviation, General Dynamics makes land and expeditionary combat vehicles, munitions and shipbuilding and naval systems. The company develops and produces a full range of MBTs , including the Abrams M1A2 digitized MBT, wheeled armoured combat vehicles and tracked and infantry fighting vehicles. General Dynamics also designs and builds submarines, including the Virginia-class attack submarines, and also conducts conversions to Trident ballistic-missile submarines. The company also builds surface ships, made both for the navy and commercial customers. This includes the Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyer; large cargo ships and auxiliary and combat-logistics ships. The company saw revenue increase to US$31bn in 2009, up from US$29bn in the previous year. The increase was achieved by an 18% y-o-y strengthening in sales at General Dynamics Combat Systems division, which grew to US$9bn. The companys shipbuilding division, Marine Systems, similarly had a record year in 2009, with sales growing by 15% y-o-y to US$6bn. General Dynamics posted better than expected earnings in Q209, with income reaching US$621mn from continuing operations, this compares to US$641mn in Q208. Total sales for H109 reached US$16bn, compared with US$14bn for the same period in 2008. United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Latest Activity The DoD is embarking on a naval modernisation programme with Saudi Arabia one of the biggest customers for US arms amounting to US$15-20bn, to include the navys small and agile LCS to counter piracy and for coastal operations. Two separate versions are being made by Lockheed and General Dynamics. The most promising areas of the US defence industry, for much of the current decade and set to dominate the scene in years to come, are IT; communications requiring advanced software systems; and high-tech equipment for field operations. Recent acquisitions of defence IT companies reflect this trend: General Dynamics has acquired Anteon International and Lockheed Martin has acquired Aspen Systems among others. A special division of General Dynamics, Ordnance and Tactical Systems , conducted successful air-drop tests of a new missile guidance system, sponsored by the US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center in late 2008. The system will enable existing ground-launched mortars to be modified to a more lightweight version for use on the Armys UAVs . In May 2009, General Dynamics was awarded a US Army contract for US$150mn to produce Hydra-70 unguided rockets plus warheads and motors, with delivery beginning September 2010. The warhead configurations are designed to fit aircrews specific rocket mission and will be deployed on rotary and fixed-wing aircraft the USAF F-16 Fighting Falcon and US Marine Corps Cobra attack helicopters. In October 2009, the company won a US$50mn contract to provide engineering and logistical support for the restarted Land Warrior programme, which comprises a wearable computer to enable soldiers to transmit information to other soldiers and levels of command. In December 2009, the company won a US$322mn Army contract to provide initial outfitting and transition support for the newly renovated Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and the newly built Fort Belvoir Community Hospital in Virginia. In January 2010, General Dynamics NASSCO won a US$824mn contract to construct and supply two T-AKE dry cargo-ammunition ships for the US Navy. Delivery of the T-AKE 13 and 14 to the Navys Military Sealift Command is due in 2012. In December 2008, NASSCO had been awarded a US$200mn contract to buy the engines and other long-lead materials for the vessels. Logistics support, including vehicle upgrades and resets, is an increasingly important segment of the companys combat systems-related business. In February, General Dynamics Land Systems won a US$253mn contract to supply logistics support for the Stryker combat vehicle fleet, specifically to supply services and spare parts for the US Armys TACOM Lifecycle Management Command. In March 2010, General Dynamics was awarded the first phase of a GBR4bn deal to produce new armoured cars for the British military. The companys UK unit also acquired defence equipment manufacturer Kylmar in June 2010. General Dynamic won an order from the US Army in June 2010 to produce 25mm and 30mm ammunition in a US$14mn contract. The company was awarded a US$49mn contract by the US Air Force in the same month to provide support for reconnaissance weapons systems. Earlier in the month, the company had won a US$10mn contract to provide parts for armoured vehicles and a US$92mn contract to provide weapons stations for the US Army. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 117 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Strengths Leads in developing and producing largest range of state-of-the-art high-tech Command, Control and Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems. Moving up with increasingly lucrative military technologies for the modern battlefield advanced electronics, electro-optical/infrared sensors, precision engagement aviation, telemetry, microwave systems, SATCOM and antenna, simulation and training.

Leading in homeland security products for aviation, port, maritime and cargo security. Broad and mostly expanding customer base as well as the DoD, the DHS, US intelligence agencies, other federal agencies, state and local government, allied foreign defence ministries, US aerospace and defence contractors, commercial clients. Increase of US$16mn in Q209 (US$10mn after income tax, or US$0per diluted share), due mainly to actuarial loss in 2008 resulting from decline in fair value of pension plan assets. The companys exports are restrained by the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations . A L-3 unit was temporarily suspended from receiving new federal contracts by the US Air Force in June 2010. Opportunities Will benefit from growing emphasis on C3ISR requirements. Homeland security as an expanding sector will need more scanning equipment as the threat of smuggling and weapons proliferation grows. Need for aircraft modernisation, advanced avionics, enhanced air defence. For homeland security, providing deepwater and port security systems and border protection of increasing importance in smuggling and terrorism prevention and further expansion into airport detection technologies market. Defence secretary Robert Gates has announced major reform of ITAR, which may help increase sales in medium to long term if implemented. Threats As with other defence companies, but maybe less so as L-3 are in the forefront of high- tech systems, possible decline in contracts due to volatile economic situation and possible temporary decline in government spending on defence threatens cancellation or curtailment of programmes. L-3 has been under criminal investigation as of June 2010 after it emerged that one of its units was monitoring emails of workers, other firms and government employees. Company Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 118 L-3 Communications Prime contractor in the up and coming area of defence C3ISR including secure networked communications and communication products, mobile SATCOM, information security systems, missiles and munitions, shipboard communications, naval power systems, telemetry and instrumentation.

For homeland security, providing deepwater and port security systems and border protection, plus protection of US airspace, supporting law enforcement and first responders; crisis management and exercise planning. An important player in the burgeoning explosives detection market for airports and port cargo scanners, using multi-view tomography technology. In September 2009, it was awarded US Army development contract to provide hydro-mechanical power transmission for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, that is, all the electrical power it needs. Also in September, the company was awarded Army ID/IQ contract for US$48mn to supply Laser Marksmanship Training System a sustainment simulator incorporating deployed, multi-purpose, modular, scalable, small-arms, individual and unit marksmanship for training in advanced marksmanship and remedial training. In August 2009, L-3 was awarded follow-on contract by Eyak Technology for US$42mn to supply 970 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 119 Financial Performance United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 combat service support Very Small Aperture Terminals . In June 2009, it was awarded follow-on contract by US Air Forces Europe worth US$375mn over five years to supply engineering and technical services, management and professional support, and intelligence analysis and evaluation for maintenance of government owned computer software. First two task orders for US$14mn will be to supply these services to the UKs Joint Intelligence Operations Centre-Europe Analytic Centre and Germanys Warrior Preparation Centre . In November 2009, L-3 won a US$162mn contract to support the Armys Central Commands Kuwait Observer-Controller Team programme. Its MPRI Division will be a subcontractor to Raytheon, providing training for US and Coalition forces at the Udari Range in Kuwait. In March 2010, the STRATIS division was awarded a three-year contract amounting to US$230mn to supply intelligence support services programme management, intelligence analysis and planning and counterintelligence support for US and multinational forward operating bases in Iraq. The company won a US$9mn aircraft maintenance contract in June 2010. Earlier in May, L-3 Communications subsidiary WESCAM was awarded a US$110mn contract to provide imaging turrets to the US Air Force. L-3 lost an US$5bn logistics contract in June 2010 after it emerged that its Special Support Programs Division had been monitoring e-mails exchanged by its staff, other firms and even government employees. The unit has also been temporarily suspended from receiving any new government contracts as it is now under criminal investigation. Prior Activity Has provided 2,400 Hawkeye 1metre VSAT units to the US Army since 2004, Has been prime supplier to the DoD and DHS of SATCOM systems that integrate data, broadband, telephony, multimedia, audio, video, and computer networking. Used by other federal agencies and commercial customers, In 2006, L-3 acquired SSG Precision Optronics, TCS Design and Management Services, and Advanced System Architectures . In 2005, acquired security and communications specialist Titan for US$2bn, By 2006, had gone up the US defence league to sixth place with sales of US$11bn and US$12bn in 2006. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 120 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Strengths Lockheed Martin is a major global defence company with a full range of defence technologies and 3,000 individual programmes. The company operates in 75 markets. Lockheed Martin is a world pioneer in aircraft technologies fighters, transport airlifters , high-altitude reconnaissance and simulation systems. Major missile manufacturer, full range of strategic and precision strike systems. Also has full range of missile defence systems. Delivery systems include the F-16, F/A-22 and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which are capable of delivering precision weapons. World leader in R&D and production of radars in operation in 38 countries. Five main DoD-defined network centric capabilities: integrated communications links, focused logistics, battle space/situational awareness, force application, command and control, protection. The companys A-issuer default rating was affirmed by Fitch Ratings. Weaknesses April 2009 future projection for 2010 defence budget included cessation of production of F-22 fighter jet limited to 187 aircraft. By US law, the F-22 cannot be marketed and sold to overseas customers. The DoD officials may order fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighters because of increasing costs. Cancellation of order for presidential fleet of VH-71 helicopters. No planned increase in ground-based missile interceptors for Alaskan deployment. The companys exports are restrained by the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations . Opportunities Proposals in the 2010 defence budget include the purchase of 30 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft in the long term, as many as 2,443 aircraft . Increased order for Littoral Combat Ships from 2-3 in FY10 to 55. Increasing funding for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System as part of the BMD programme. Defence secretary Robert Gates has announced major reform of ITAR, which may help increase sales in medium- to long-term if implemented. Threats Possible decline in contracts due to volatile economic situation and possible temporary decline in government spending on defence means cancellation of programmes. Possible decline in contracts for missile defence due to Obamas intention to scale back the BMD programme. Longer timescales for programme development. Company Overview Financial Performance Business Monitor International Ltd Page 121 Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin provides the full spectrum of aircraft technologies ranging from aircraft manufacture, munitions, training, focused logistics, targeting and navigation. The company also specialises in R&D in high-performance combat, air mobility and reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft , missile defence systems, radars, anti-aircraft systems, naval defence. The company saw net sales increase by 6% y-o-y to US$45bn in 2009, up from US$42bn in the previous year. United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 In Q209, cash from operations reached in excess of US$1bn. However, net earnings reached just US$734mn down from US$882mn in 2008. Q209 net sales reached U$11bn a similar level to that witnessed in Q208. Meanwhile, cash from operations reached US$1bn down from a figure of US$1bn. Lockheed Martin has had to endure the cancellation of important programmes: the TSAT Mission Operations System contract, F-22 Raptor fighter and the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter programme. Lockheed Martins high-cost platform programmes have been the prime targets of Obama administration budget cuts. However, the Moroccan deal for US$841mn will help to boost the companys backlog, which after the first nine months of FY09 had shrunk to US$76bn from US$80bn at year-end FY08. The company has, however, achieved above the industry average for return on investment and expanding product lines throughout 2009-2010, However, there are still risks related to the execution of key projects, the high cost of platform programmes, along with lower results in the Aeronautics segment, increased pensions liability and fewer government programmes for satellites. Latest Activity For missile defence, Lockheed Martin is developing boosters, targets and countermeasures, infrared seekers, precision pointing and tracking optics, radars and signal processing. The company also makes the Aegis naval system for BMD and defence against ships, subs, torpedoes. But sizeable weapons programmes are being cut back, such as the DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer for the Navy and Lockheeds F-22 Raptor fifth-generation fighter. The F-22 fleet was capped at a total of 187 fighters, which is just one-quarter the total sought when the programme begun during the Cold War, but Lockheed Martin is fiercely campaigning to keep production lines open with 95,000 US jobs at stake. The most promising areas of the US defence industry, for much of the current decade and set to dominate the scene in years to come, are IT; communications requiring advanced software systems; and high-tech equipment for field operations. Recent acquisitions of defence IT companies reflect this trend with Lockheed Martin acquiring Aspen Systems among others. Lockheed Martin acquired Aspen Systems in 2008. M&A activity in the sector has partly been driven by US government procurement policies. In December 2009, the company won a contract from the Moroccan government worth US$841mn to supply 24 F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighters and related equipment. Also in December, Jordan put in an order to Javelin for 1,808 Javelin missiles worth US$388mn, which also includes 18 fly-to-buy missiles and 162 Javelin command launch units. In March 2010, LM received a US$171mn low-rate initial production contract from Northrop Grumman to produce four AN/APY-9 airborne early warning radars and support systems for the Navy's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Also in March 2010, DoD officials warned that increasing programme costs may lead to their ordering fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The company is the lead developer in production of a Terminal High Altitude Defence missile system for the UAE. In June 2010, Lockheed Martin said that it expects the US government to issue a Business Monitor International Ltd Page 122 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 letter of agreement on the sale to the UAE by August 2010, Also in June 2010, the company was awarded a US$1mn contract by the US Army to continue development of a Kinetic Energy Net armour design for helicopters. The company was awarded a logistics contract worth up to US$5bn by the US Special Operations Command in June 2010. Lockheed was originally awarded the contract in March 2010, but this was revoked after protests from L-3 Communications, which had held the contract previously. However, the contract was re-awarded after it emerged that a L-3 unit had been monitoring its staffs e-mails, along with those of other companies and government employees. Lockheed and the US Navy are looking to opportunities to sell the companys Littoral Combat Ship abroad to their mutual benefit, after the Navy confirmed that it would be buying both classes of the vessel. Sales abroad could potentially reduce costs of the programme, which has been beset with various technical and cost problems. Both the Saudi Arabian and Israeli navies are said to be interested in the LCS, which has been described as an attractive platform for the international market by Lockheed officials, who assert that construction of the vessels in the US for export should provide benefits for the US Navy through cost savings. In December 2009, the US Navy awarded Lockheed and Austal USA contracts worth upwards of US$400mn to construct the first of ten vessels to be built by 2015. Prior Activity The company was founded in 1909 and are pioneers in aviation and space. Lockheed Martin was formed in 1995 out of merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta Corporation the second and third largest defence contractors in the US. Pioneering technological achievements include the Hubble Space Telescope, the F-22 Stealth fighter and the Freedom space station. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 123 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Strengths Vastly experienced and varied high-tech R&D expertise and production facilities. Covers all burgeoning areas of defence technology from submarine systems to missiles, space systems and cyber systems. Develops and provides many advanced IT systems, which comprise one of the fastest growing sectors within defence. Products include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems. Main strengths are cyber security, intelligence, global reach, precision strike and missile defence systems. For missile defence, it can provide full range of technologies for BMD: sensors; shooters; integration and battle management, command, control and communications . Weaknesses Reduced share price in the second half of 2008 . Steep decline in equity market valuations. While this did not affect normal business operations, it resulted in a reported loss from continuing operations of US$3per share in 2008. Has to keep up with major competitor Boeing to secure bids. The companys exports are restrained by the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations . Opportunities Significant competitive wins of further contracts for the companys leading-edge electronics technologies. Continues to focus on unmanned aerial vehicles and C3ISR. Cyber security and cyber warfare systems recent lapses in cyber security will attract lucrative contracts and cyber warfare is a rapidly rising aspect of defence, which will instigate a race for companies to secure big contracts and attract the best skills. Defence secretary Robert Gates has announced major reform of ITAR, which may help increase sales in medium- to long-term if implemented. Threats Possible decline in contracts, due to volatile economic situation and possible temporary decline in government spending on defence. Possible decline in contracts for missile defence, due to Obamas announced intention to scale back BMD programme. Possible large-scale problems with pensions as plan returns are connected to stock market performance. Drop in 2009 means higher pension costs and earnings may also be affected. Company Overview Financial Performance Business Monitor International Ltd Page 124 Northrop Grumman Northrup Grumman is a world leader in innovative systems and products in aerospace, electronics, information systems, shipbuilding and technical services. This was to bring about economies of scale in the face of rapidly rising R&D costs of high-tech weapons systems, the demand for which has largely overtaken previous Cold War needs for military equipment. As with all defence sectors, the US sector depends entirely on government funding. There is a mixed picture as of September 2009. Defence giants such as Northrup Grumman were down as much as 30% on investment after Obama became president, but then recovered later in 2009. Still, Northrup appears to be in good shape. In 2008, the company achieved record sales which increased by 6% to nearly US$32bn. In 2008, contract awards were US$48bn including competitive wins and big follow-on awards in core franchise programmes. United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Indeed, sales strengthened over 2009 to US$33bn, while operating income increased from US$2bn in 2008 to US$2bn in 2009. Latest Activity In September 2010, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems told employees that it planned to cut 500 jobs by year end as part of a cost-reduction drive. The layoffs will mostly be at the firms plants at Redondo Beach, El Segundo and Manhattan Beach and will mainly affect indirect support staff that is, backroom staff rather than those working on government contracts. The recent decision to curtail the BMD programme will likely make spending on missile defence one of the casualties of the current period. So far this has amounted to some US$10bn a year, funding several programmes conducted mainly by the big hitters most notably Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Orbital Sciences and ATK. However, Northrup has won a US$5bn contract for the navys next-generation aircraft carrier, the Gerald R. Ford and a US$5bn contract for Block III of Virginia-class submarines. Another example of a big recent contract was in August 2009 when its cyber security sector won a five-year, US$430mn army contract for information and network operations. The technology is to be used to coordinate electronic-warfare, military deception, psychological warfare, and security operations. In December 2009, the company won a US Navy contract for maintenance, repair and modernisation of submarines stationed at and in transit through Pearl Harbor in a contract worth US$140mn. The DoD awarded Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation a US$303mn deal to produce four Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft in May 2010. The aircraft include two Block 30 and two Block 40 vehicles, while the contract also includes support services. Prior Activity In 1996, Northrup acquired the defence/electronics businesses of Westinghouse Electric. This included the development and production of advanced radar and other electronic systems. In 2001, the company acquired another leading electronics firm, Litton Industries . In January 2008, Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding was formed out of Newport News and Ship Systems businesses. Meanwhile, in April 2008, the company sold its Electro-Optical Systems business to L-3 Communications. In 2008, Northrup also transferred some programmes and assets from Mission Systems segments missile business to its Space Technology segment, allowing Mission Systems to focus on rapidly growing C3ISR work. In January 2010, the company won a US$577mn contract to construct the next-generation missile defence command system for the US Army. The Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System incorporates the Patriot interceptor and other existing air and missile defence weapons, and will be designed to connect commanders to all weapons, sensors, intelligence and other tactical data in theatre. The system is due to be deployed in 2014. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 125 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Strengths Continues to make substantial profits in its missile, space, network centric, integrated defence systems. A very long history nearly 90 years of experience in defence innovation and manufacturing. Dominates missile and missile defence market makes full range, air-to-air, strike, naval, land combat, guided projectiles as well as exoatmospheric kill vehicles and directed energy weapons. In September 2009, reached Capability Maturity Model Integration level 5 for its missile systems. Weaknesses Due to a change in Missile Defense Agency priorities, the company terminated the Kinetic Energy Interceptor programme in June 2009. Although the company sells to commercial clients, some 85% of sales are from US government accounts. It is expected to continue at strength, but this may vary according to current government policy. Raytheon has been criticised for its close links with government at all levels and charges of influence peddling. The companys exports are restrained by the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations . Opportunities Growing demand for international Patriot programmes resulting in a 6% increase in Q209 for Integrated Defense Systems , which had net sales of US$1,335mn. Able to meet further demand for enhanced interoperability and mission control systems, as well as a host of hi-tech systems. Defence secretary, Robert Gates, has announced major reform of ITAR, which may help increase sales in medium- to long-term if implemented. Threats A possible decline in contracts due to the volatile economic situation and possible temporary decline in government spending on defence. Possible decline in contracts for missile defence due to Obamas intention to scale back BMD programme. Possible large-scale problems with pensions, as plan returns are connected to stock market performance. Drop in 2009 means higher pension costs and earnings may also be affected. Company Overview Financial Performance Business Monitor International Ltd Page 126 Raytheon Raytheon is the world leader in electronics, missiles, mission systems integration, sensing and effects, C3ISR, targeting, navigation systems, radars, early warning systems and mission support services. Raytheon is also the worlds largest producer of guided missiles. The company ranks high among the DoDs 10 main defence contractors and is the worlds fifth biggest defence company. The companys net sales increased to US$24bn in 2009, up from US$23bn in the previous year. Operating income also rose to US$3bn over the year, up from US$2bn in 2008. In Q209, Raytheon generated a 17% increase in income from continuing operations of to US$504mn from US$432mn in Q108. Total sales reached US$6bn, while continued bookings reached US$7bn an increase from US$5bn in Q208. Latest Activity Raytheon has a strong missiles business, which in Q209, earned US$521mn through the production of Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles for USAF and overseas customers. Raytheon United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 also sold US$260mn of Phalanx Weapon Systems for the US Army and Navy; US$207mn of Tactical Tomahawk cruise missiles and US$167mn in AIM-9X short-range Navy air-to-air missiles . The companys Space and Airborne Systems unit had a 6% y-o-y increase in Q209 net sales to US$1bn. For missile defence, Raytheon has developed the Laser Area Defense System , which engages mortars and rockets with a range of up to 500m. The company is also developing an advanced spectroscopic portal for radiological monitoring of vehicles and containers. In March 2009, the US Navy ordered from Raytheon the AGM-145C-1 JSOW (Joint Stand-Off Weapon, which with its two-way datalink system it is said by Raytheon will become, when it enters naval service in 2010, the first network-enabled weapon to be deployed anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, the Saudis signed a deal with Raytheon in March 2009 for the US giant to supply 150 AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles for the Saudis F-15 fighter aircraft. Raytheon went from strength to strength in 2008, sealing contracts with Finland, Kuwait, Morocco, Singapore and South Korea for over 800 AMRAAM missiles. Raytheon is also working with Japan and the government department responsible for BMD deployments, the US Missile Defense Agency, on the development of an interceptor missile, the Block 1A and upgraded version the Block 1AA, for use at sea. The Japanese, who are closely collaborating with the US on BMD for their own protection against North Korean missiles, has used the Aegis BMD system to detect, track and destroy a target in mid-course, and has Raytheon missiles on its Kongou-class destroyers. The company has demonstrated the ability of the AIM-9X Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missile to attack surface targets armoured personnel carriers and manoeuvring speed boats. Three flight tests of the technology have been successfully completed, using USAF funds for Wartime Rapid Acquisition Projects . In December 2009, Raytheon won a US$1bn contract for the production of Patriot Air and Missile Defences for Taiwan, including ground system hardware under an initial contract valued at US$965mn and an initial spares contract for US$134mn. The order adds to earlier bookings amounting to US$1bn for the Patriot programme from January to September 2009. Also in December, Jordan put in an order to the Javelin JV of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for 1,808 Javelin missiles worth US$388mn, which also includes 18 fly-to-buy missiles and 162 Javelin command launch units. In February 2010, Raytheon won a US$170m contract to supply one of the US burgeoning markets, the UAE, with Maverick air-to-surface missiles to include production and life-cycle support for a minimum of 500 AGM-65D/G2 infrared-guided missiles. More than 69,000 have been produced to date, with the company claiming over 6,000 used in combat have achieved a success rate of 93%. The company is also working on an UAE order for a Terminal High Altitude Defence missile system, for which Raytheon is proving radar technology. Lockheed Martin, which is the lead developer on the contract, said that it expects the US government to issue a letter of agreement to the UAE by August 2010. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 127 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Prior Activity Raytheon has an illustrious, inventive past. In the 1940s, the company adapted World War II radar and developed the first guided missile and followed this up with the first geosynchronous communications satellite in 1964. Raytheon also manufactured the computer for the Apollo 11 moon landing and pioneered laser-guided missiles in the 1970s and Patriot missiles in the 1990s for the first Gulf War.

Source: ILO, BMI Table: Average Annual Wages, 2000-2012 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 132 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 BMIs industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variables own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variables own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historic data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each defence variable. Defence Budget And Expenditure Figures for the defence budget are based, where possible, on primary government/ministry sources and official data. Where these are unavailable, defence budget/expenditure forecasts are based on a range of variables including: Stated expenditure and procurement plans; Likely increases to expenditure owing to security threats; Business Monitor International Ltd Page 133 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts Defence Industry United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Political factors ; Readiness of the military; and, Commitments of the armed forces. Expenditure per capita / % of GDP / % of fiscal budget are calculated using BMIs own macroeconomic and demographic forecasts. Employment In Arms Production Forecasted based on the following criteria: The growth or otherwise of the defence industry; and, Company results and expansion plans. Arms Imports/Exports Forecasted based on the following criteria: Arms ordered and not yet delivered; Stated procurement plans; Military needs ; and, Occasionally realpolitik . BMIs City Terrorism Rating covers 170 cities worldwide. The Terrorism Rating incorporates our analysts qualitative view of the terrorist threat. However, it also incorporates secondary analysis of data on global terrorist incidents obtained from the US State Departments Worldwide Incidents Tracking System , to provide a quantitative assessment of the risks. Due to the usage of State Department data, the definition of terrorist incidents refers to incidents in which subnational or clandestine groups or individuals deliberately or recklessly attacked civilians or noncombatants. Specifically, all incidents have been either claimed or inferred as being perpetrated by groups previously designated as terrorists. State Typology To offer a cross-country comparison of the terrorist threat, the City Terrorism Rating accommodates the qualitative difference between the terrorism threat across states, which, broadly-speaking, can be grouped as follows: Business Monitor International Ltd Page 134 City Terrorism Rating United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 Type A State: Endemic terrorist threat. Some states experience an ongoing terrorist threat, in which groups are able to remain active for many years due to the sympathy of a significant ethnic, religious or economic minority. Thus, the resultant terrorist threat is, in broad terms, predictable and illustrates a widely acknowledged failure of the state/government to gain universal legitimacy within its borders, and/or its failure to adequately enforce the rule of law. Type B State: Unpredictable terrorist threat. The threat in other states is more diffuse. Governments rarely enjoy unchallenged legitimacy, but terrorist groups which may be motivated by global as well as state-specific issues may lack sufficient support to wage sustained campaigns, or have their ability to operate extremely circumscribed by a well organised and funded counter-terrorism effort by the state. Importantly, while the threat posed in Type A states can be anticipated with reasonable certainty, assessing risks in cities in Type B states, using a data-led methodology risks under-estimating the threat level. Indeed, the oft-quoted scientific epithet that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence could be recast as absence of attacks, does not indicate absence of intent, nor even absence of capability. As a tactic, terrorism is most successful when incidents are without precedent, either in terms of location or scale. The implications of this for the methodology are that we adopt a state-led approach . Limits It is important to clarify the limits of the CTR. While terrorism is popularly conflated with all challenges to the rule of law, the CTR more narrowly focused. For example, it specifically excludes the activities of organised criminal gangs, whose strategy and tactics may be similar to terrorist groups, but whose aims result are markedly different. Consequently, there are cities that have a high terrorism risk, but are otherwise characterised by a comparatively strong rule of law, and vice versa. Thus, while the CTR should form part of a clients consideration of the risks associated with each city, it does not provide a snapshot of the overall risks to physical safety and security. Methodological Overview The CTR is predominantly based on data on terrorist attacks, but is also relies on a qualitative assessment of risks. City-specific ratings are generated thus: State-wide risks are assessed. The methodology is contained in the table below. This benchmark rating provides: a) An evaluation of broad risks, thereby setting a ratings ceiling for cities in which no recent activity has taken place. As such, our approach mirrors that of credit ratings agencies, where sovereign credit ratings set a ceiling for ratings of corporate debt issuance. b) Data against which city-specific activity can be compared . City-Specific Rating are created via an integration of the state-wide threat, with an evaluation of the city-specific characteristics and level of activity. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 135 United States Defence & Security Report Q1 2011 The methodology is contained in the table below. Table: Methodology Risk rated Primary assessment Secondary assessment Rationale Weighting State Evaluation of known groups/ grievances Qualitative assessment na Incorporates country risk knowledge of known risks Frequency of attacks (per population) Attacks over 4 years na Broad measure of activity Physical threat (per population) Victims over 4 years Score weighted by proportion of victims that died Broad measure of actual physical threat; death rate used as proxy for broad terrorist intentions 50% City Evaluation of known groups/ grievances Victims over 4 years na Incorporates knowledge of known risks Frequency of Attacks Attacks over 4 years Score weighted by city attacks vs state attacks Measure of city activity, weighting reflects whether city is priority target Physical threat (per city population) Victims over 4 years Score weighted by proportion of victims that died city victims vs state victims, consistency of threat over 4-year period Actual physical threat.

Page 5 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Executive Summary This new Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report from BMI forecasts that the country will account for 2% of Central and Eastern European regional oil demand by 2015, while providing 2% of supply. CEE regional oil use of 5mn barrels per day in 2001 is forecast to rise to 6mn b/d in 2010. It should increase to around 6mn b/d by 2015. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001 and is expected to average 13mn b/d in 2010. It is set to rise to 15mn b/d by 2015. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total is forecast to rise to 7mn b/d in 2010 and to 8mn b/d by 2015. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the key exporter. In terms of natural gas, the region will consume an estimated 636bn cubic metres in 2010, with demand of 747bcm targeted for 2015, representing 17% growth. Production of an estimated 787bcm in 2010 should reach 954bcm in 2015, which implies net exports rising from an estimated 151bcm in 2010 to 206bcm by the end of the period. Turkmenistans share of consumption in 2010 is estimated to be 3%, while its share of production is put at 8%. By 2015, its share of demand is forecast to be 4%, with the country accounting for 9% of supply. For 2010 as a whole, we assume an average OPEC basket price of US$77/bbl (+26% year-on-year ). The 2010 US WTI price is now put at US$79/bbl. BMI is assuming an OPEC basket price of US$80/bbl in 2011, with WTI averaging US$82, Brent at US$82/bbl, Urals delivering around US$81and the Dubai average being US$80/bbl. Our central assumption for 2012 is an OPEC price averaging US$85/bbl, delivering WTI at approximately US$87and Brent at US$87/bbl. From 2013 onwards, we are using an average OPEC price of US$90/bbl. For the whole of 2010, the BMI assumption for the global gasoline price is an average US$87/bbl, representing a y-o-y rise of 24%. The global gasoil forecast is for an average price of US$88/bbl, probably peaking in December 2010 at more than US$95/bbl. The full-year outturn represents a 27% increase from the 2009 level. For 2010, the annual jet price level is forecast to be US$89/bbl. This compares with US$70/bbl in 2009. The 2010 average naphtha price is put by BMI at US$77/bbl, up almost 31% from the previous years level. BMI forecasts Turkmen real GDP rising by 8% in 2010, followed by average annual growth of 10% from 2010-2015. Domestic consumption trends can be expected to return to a strong growth tack from 2010 onwards, estimated at an average of 5% per annum. By 2015, the country could be using 158,000b/d of oil. Turkmenistan has traditionally been protective of its onshore basins, allowing international oil companies to participate only in offshore developments. Offshore activity should Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 help raise national crude and gas liquids output from an estimated 220,000b/d in 2010 to 375,000b/d by 2015. Gas production is expected to increase from an estimated 65bcm to 90bcm between 2010 and 2015. Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 54%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d at the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption is set to increase by 62% between 2010 and 2020, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 201,000b/d by 2020. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 96bcm. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Turkmenistan now shares 11th place with Uzbekistan in BMIs composite Business Environment Ratings table, which combines upstream and downstream scores. It shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in 10th place, ahead of Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia. Medium-term scope exists for Turkmenistan to challenge Hungary above it. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Political SWOT Strengths Common strategic interests will smooth regional relations with Turkmenistan's energy-hungry neighbours such as China, and possibly even the EU. Weaknesses Despite growing discontent over increased repression and corruption, there is little prospect of an organised opposition gaining a foothold. Harsh methods will be used to suppress public protest, and multimillion-dollar contracts signed with Western companies will mute business support. Opportunities The stable transition of power after Saparmurat Niyazov's death is a positive sign of political stability. President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedovs early policies indicate that he may be willing to forge greater trade and business links with foreign countries. Threats Turkmenistan will remain one of the world's most restrictive societies, and with few of the benefits from increased hydrocarbon sales reaching the population, there remains some risk of civil uprising. Turkmenistan Economic SWOT Strengths Economic activity will be supported by the ongoing expansion of energy production and exports, ensuring strong growth in the medium term. The government's ambitious strategy for a fivefold increase in real GDP between 2000 and 2010 will encourage efforts to boost sustainability in all sectors of the economy. Weaknesses The official economic figures remain unreliable, reflecting the legacy of the Soviet era when only 'positive data' were released. With fiscal management opaque, international financial institutions will continue to find it hard to analyse and support Turkmenistan's economic development. The persistence of central planning, with government use of production targets and mandatory state procurement, will prevent efficient resource allocation, risking shortages of consumer goods, inflationary pressure and stunted growth. Opportunities A gas pipeline to China, currently under construction, will help diversify the country's export markets. Moreover, the country is also considering diversifying its gas export routes to Europe, bypassing Russia. The trade surplus provides an opportunity for the government to diversify the economy. Threats Trade levels will continue to fluctuate greatly while gas markets remain vulnerable to interruptions in pipeline access and external shocks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Turkmenistan Business Environment SWOT Strengths Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2009. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm, ranking it among the worlds top five countries. Weaknesses Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow have soured, following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Opportunities Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. The country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. In May 2007, the chairman of state company Turkmengaz, Yashygeldy Kakayev, said the countrys energy strategy was to almost double gas production to 120bcm by 2010 and more than treble production to 240bcm by 2030. Threats Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Turkmenistan Energy Market Overview Once-isolationist Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many international oil companies had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. Some, however, have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of around 8,100bcm , ranking it among the worlds top five countries. The country contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya Basin in the east, the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian Basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. The revision puts reserve estimates above the high estimate made by UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates when it conducted the first independent assessment of the field in October 2008. GCA put the field's low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm. Companies from South Korea, the UAE and China have been awarded US$9bn of contracts by the government to develop South Yolotan. These companies include China National Petroleum Corporation , LG International and Petrofac International. The contracts will include drilling and building gas processing plants in the Yolotan region. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. State-owned Turkmengaz hoped to have increased its production capacity to 100bcm per annum by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in October 2009. The Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 source said that the output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The news suggests that Turkmenistan is looking beyond the end of its current dispute with Russia to the possibility of export deals that will require additional production capacity. Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Review, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to 206,000b/d in 2009. The government targets higher production, but the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals because of a shifting interest to gas production and lagging foreign investment. The country exports around half of its production. Local demand is estimated at 120,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. In February 2008, the president introduced a new fuels retail system providing transportation customers with free gasoline up to a specified level and charging a market rate, established by the state, for amounts exceeding the quota. Turkmenistan has two major refineries, the Seidi and Turkmenbashi, with a combined total capacity of 237,000b/d . Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. In terms of electricity, Turkmenistans installed generating capacity is estimated at 3gigawatts , with recent generation put at around 17terawatt hours . With consumption averaging around 9TWh, there is a useful net export capability. Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energyis now owned by Italys Eni group. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Turkmenistan is set to open development of its offshore Caspian oil deposits to US majors for the first time. Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov in August 2010 selected US majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips as well as US-based TX Oil and Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Oil and Gas to develop blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian Sea, according to Reuters quoting state television. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Global Oil Market Review Regaining Momentum As with Q2, the third quarter started with encouraging oil market strength, which then dissipated rapidly. If anything, oil market fundamentals improved, with demand assumptions rising. The US driving season was disappointing, but the real damage was done as macroeconomic uncertainty crept back into the market and investors turned their backs on oil. Ongoing eurozone economic woes, fresh China jitters and a general sense of macroeconomic fragility meant that oil prices were dragged lower with equities and currencies. We remained convinced that there would be a belated rally, as the world heads towards winter in a higher-demand quarter. Thus far, our confidence has been rewarded by a recovery that began in September and accelerated into October. Demand projections for 2010 continued to firm up during the third quarter, with some upgrades coming through for 2011, even though the jury is out regarding the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery. After rising steadily in the first half of the year, OPEC volumes appear to have levelled out in Q3. The organisation has done and said little to change the supply/demand landscape, although some members at the October 14 ministerial gathering were arguing the case for a US$100/bbl target to compensate for the weakening of the US dollar, which is undermining their revenues. According to the International Energy Agency s October 2010 monthly Oil Market Report , OECD end-August commercial oil inventories stood at 2,790mn bbl, reaching their highest level since August 1998. However, a very significant fall looks to have been recorded in September during a period when a small stock rise is the norm. With demand having strengthened and supply having stalled, a continuation of this inventory trend could support an oil price recovery throughout Q4. September saw global oil supply fall by some 150,000b/d according to the IEA. Non-OPEC producers saw volumes fall during the month, while a modest increase in OPEC production failed to compensate. Crude oil supply from OPEC averaged 29mn b/d in September , up by 40,000b/d when compared with the previous month. Much of this increase, however, reflects Iraqi output gains, with the 11 core members actually reducing supply by some 150,000b/d. Quota compliance of around 54% is a definite improvement on the years low of around 50%, even if well short of the 59% historical OPEC norm. Non-OPEC supply in September fell by just 20,000b/d, with the US hurricane season doing little to disrupt output. During the third quarter, non-OPEC supply was fairly stable when compared with Q2 and not significantly above the Q1 level. Output of around 52mn b/d in Q3 compares with 52mn b/d in Q2 and 52mn b/d in the opening quarter of the year. September volumes are put at 52mn b/d. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Given positive demand-side developments, a capping of recent supply growth and some evidence of a fall in stock levels, it is hardly surprising that the end of Q3 saw oil prices gaining ground. At the time of our July 2010 quarterly oil price report, the OPEC basket was just below US$73/bbl. It reached almost US$79/bbl in early August, before collapsing to less than US$70/bbl later in the month. September then saw a steady increase from around US$72/bbl to US$77/bbl, with momentum being retained into early October and the OPEC price reaching US$80/bbl by the time this report was written. The Energy Information Administration s October 2010 monthly report suggested that Q310 global oil demand was 86mn b/d, compared with 86mn b/d in Q210 and 84mn b/d in Q309 (+1% yo-y). Non-OECD demand is reported at 41mn b/d, compared with 41mn b/d in the previous quarter and 39mn b/d in Q309 (+3% y-o-y). The OECD states saw a 0mn b/d quarter-on-quarter rise in consumption during Q310, with demand amounting to 45mn b/d. In Q309, OECD demand was 44mn b/d, based on EIA data. According to the Paris-based IEA, Q310 global consumption averaged 87mn b/d, compared with 86mn b/d in Q210 and 85mn b/d in Q309. The y-o-y change was put at +2%. OECD demand in Q310 is reported at 45mn b/d, compared with 45mn b/d in Q210 and 44mn b/d in Q309. Non-OECD consumption in Q310 was reportedly up 3% y-o-y at 41mn b/d. In Q210, non-OECD consumption was 41mn b/d. OPECs October 2010 monthly oil report states Q310 global oil demand at 85mn b/d, up from 84mn b/d during the previous quarter and up from 84mn b/d in Q309 (+1%). OECD demand is said to have risen by 0% y-o-y to 45mn b/d, with North American consumption higher by 0%. Non-OECD demand was up 2% y-o-y to 40mn b/d, according to OPEC data. The EIAs Q310 estimates suggest that non-OPEC oil supply was 51mn b/d, compared with the Q210 level of 51mn b/d and the 50mn b/d recorded in Q309 (+1% y-o-y). Russia, the US and China were significant contributors to the supply increase. OPEC output for Q310 is put at 35mn b/d , up from 34mn b/d in Q210 and the 34mn b/d delivered in the third quarter of 2009. Global Q310 production based on IEA data was an average 87mn b/d. This compares with 86mn b/d in Q210. The non-OPEC element for the most recent quarter is 52mn b/d, easing lower from 52mn b/d in Q2. Overall OPEC volumes, including gas liquids, are said to have risen from 34mn b/d to 34mn b/d between Q210 and Q310. Quarterly Trends Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 OPEC itself believes that non-OPEC oil supply averaged 52mn b/d in Q310. OPEC crude output was assessed at 29mn b/d during the quarter, with the cartel pumping an average 29mn b/d in September. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Global Oil Market Outlook Sitting Comfortably Autumn has brought with it some renewed optimism regarding macroeconomic prospects and the oil price outlook. As the bears head indoors to hibernate, there is scope for a sustained Q4 recovery. For 2011, however, uncertainty still weighs heavily on the market. We believe the supply/demand balance can support a modest rise in crude prices, but we do not subscribe to the US$100 view that prevails in some circles. Admittedly, the most bullish of macroeconomic projections could deliver demand above current expectations. With non-OPEC supply unlikely to rise quickly during the coming year, OPEC could no doubt engineer higher prices. With quotas unchanged at the October meeting, however, and little evidence of serious concern over compliance, it is realistic to assume that higher demand will be met by increased OPEC supply. A basket price somewhat in excess of US$80 per barrel seems to suit most members, providing a degree of comfort for producers and consumers alike. In our September 2010 monthly update we took the unusual step of flagging up a change to our oil price assumptions. It had become apparent by that point that achieving more than US$80 in 2010 was unlikely, thanks to the dull summer market. With a predicted Q4 rally, we revised our 2010 target to US$77/bbl and that view is reiterated in this quarterly assessment. Given that OPEC crude has already averaged more than US$75/bbl, we are confident that the eventual full-year outturn will be close to our forecast. Although we have reduced our 2011 OPEC basket price expectation to US$80/bbl, there is arguably some upside potential. Macroeconomic forecasts may be somewhat fragile for the year, but there are also supply risks that could offset demand-side disappointments. Outside the non-OPEC producers, where volumes are vulnerable to project over-runs, post-Macondo backlash, hurricanes and maintenance problems, there is still a question mark over Nigeria, Iran and Iraq. Achieving a market balance that allows for some inventory erosion and moderate price growth will be a complicated process. We remain confident in the medium-term trend towards a somewhat tighter market, resulting in further price progress in 2012/2013. A dramatic move to higher levels will simply wipe out demand as motorists in particular choose fuel economy over performance. Relative price stability, even in challenging economic circumstances, will largely support traditional driving patterns and slow the rate of migration towards costly hybrids, range-limited electric cars and high-economy diesels. A move back to US$85-90/bbl seems entirely possible by 2012 onwards, with supply expansion and demand growth settling at a modest but sustainable level. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Oil Price Forecasts In terms of the OPEC basket of crudes, the average price in Q310 was around US$73/bbl, down from the US$76/bbl recorded during the previous three months. This was a disappointing outcome, given that the underlying demand trends were relatively healthy. However, bearish sentiment overwhelmed market fundamentals to drive prices below the appropriate level. In Q309, the OPEC price averaged US$67/bbl, so the most recent quarter has seen a y-o-y gain of just 9%. Weekly averages had peaked initially at US$78/bbl in early August, providing false hope that the summer rally was finally under way. This petered out, with a weekly low of US$70/bbl seen by the end of August. September then saw a steady recovery, with the price breaking above US$75 as sentiment improved. October has got off to a good start, in spite of a featureless OPEC meeting, with the basket price breaking back above US$80/bbl. The monthly averages for the third quarter of 2010 were US$72, US$74and US$74/bbl. BMI is currently assuming that October will deliver an average close to US$80if the current strength is retained. We are assuming November and December averages of US$81and US$84/bbl respectively, providing a Q4 outturn of US$82/bbl. This will represent a quarter-on-quarter gain of 11% and a y-o-y increase of 10%. The full-year average will therefore work out at around US$77, compared with about US$60/bbl in 2009. In terms of other marker prices, North Sea Brent averaged US$76/bbl during Q3, with WTI achieving a surprisingly low US$76. This is a clear indication that WTI is much more prone to speculative activity and market sentiment than the other crudes, reducing its usefulness as a barometer of underlying fundamentals. Urals in Q3 averaged US$75/bbl and Dubai realised US$73. These averages have been calculated using OPEC data and monthly prices from the IEA. For 2010 as a whole, we assume an average OPEC basket price of US$77/bbl (+26% y-o-y). The 2010 US WTI price is now put at US$79/bbl. The October 2010 monthly report from the US-based EIA predicts a 2010 average WTI crude price of just under US$78/bbl, rising to US$83in 2011. BMI is assuming an OPEC basket price of US$80/bbl in 2011, with WTI averaging US$82, Brent at US$82/bbl, Urals delivering around US$81and the Dubai average being US$80/bbl. Our central assumption for 2012 is an OPEC price averaging US$85/bbl, delivering WTI at around US$87, Brent at US$87/bbl, Urals averaging around US$86and Dubai delivering US$85/bbl. From 2013 onwards, we are using an average OPEC price of US$90/bbl. The WTI, Brent, Urals and Dubai assumptions are US$92, US$92, US$91and US$90/bbl respectively. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Oil Supply, Demand And Price Outlook Short-Term Demand Outlook The BMI oil supply and demand assumptions for 2010 and beyond have once again been revised for all 71 countries forming part of our detailed coverage, reflecting the changing macroeconomic outlook and the impact of environmental initiatives. Investment in exploration, development and new production has continued to rise as a result of relatively stable crude prices, but deepwater activity has been set back by events in the Gulf of Mexico . Costs associated with oil field development and exploration/appraisal drilling continue to rise, with deepwater programmes now particularly vulnerable as a result of equipment shortages, lack of personnel and the post-Macondo regulatory environment. We have once again made some changes to forecast oil production levels, in line with recent OPEC output and known project delays, with no clear evidence of large-scale spending changes by international oil companies or national oil companies . Even in the US, the backlash from BPs Macondo disaster has led to only minor revisions to the production outlook. Other deepwater-focused regions appear to be re-examining procedures and legislation, but continuing with most exploration and development programmes. According to the updated BMI model, 2010 global oil consumption will now increase by 2% from the 2009 level. This represents an upgrade to the forecast contained in the July 2010 quarterly report, which had assumed an increase of 2%. The 2010 forecast represents slightly higher OECD demand (+1%) and a revised non-OECD increase of 3%. The overall increase in demand is estimated at 1mn b/d. North America is now expected to see expansion of 364,000b/d (+1%), with OECD European demand set to recover by 137,000b/d (+1%). Non-OECD gains are expected to be 2% in Asia, 2% in Latin America, 4% in Central/Eastern Europe, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Africa. In its October 2010 OMR, the IEA predicts a slightly more bullish rise in 2010 oil demand of 2%, or 2mn b/d. The organisations assumptions suggest an impressive 4% rise in non-OECD consumption (+1mn b/d). This points to 0% higher OECD oil demand, which lags the economic recovery. October 2010 EIA estimates suggest that world demand will rise y-o-y from 84mn b/d to 86mn b/d, with the 1mn b/d increase in consumption amounting to a gain of 2%. While there has been a significant upgrade, this view still sits below the somewhat more optimistic BMI and IEA estimates. Non-OECD demand is predicted to increase by 4% , while OECD demand is expected to rise by just 10,000b/d to 45mn b/d. Consumption in the US is expected to increase by 200,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 . With Canadian demand 3% higher and that of Europe 1% lower, it is in Japan that the US energy body sees the greatest risk of a decline forecasting a fall of 2%. OPECs October 2010 report suggests a likely increase in 2010 global oil consumption of 1mn b/d, or 1%. OECD demand is forecast to rise by 80,000b/d . Non-OECD demand is expected to average 40mn b/d, compared with 38mn b/d in 2009 (+2%).

Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. According to the revised BMI model, 2010 global oil production will rise by 2%, representing an OPEC increase of 4% and a non-OPEC gain of 1%. The overall increase in supply is estimated at 2mn b/d in 2010, an upgrade from the July 2010 quarterly report. We continue to assume that the current OPEC production ceiling will be retained for the whole of 2010 , but that actual output will remain close to the Q310 level. Should quota adherence improve further then OPEC volumes could emerge slightly lower. In October 2010, the EIA forecast a 900,000b/d y-o-y rise in non-OPEC oil output, representing a gain of 1%. World oil production is predicted to be 86mn b/d in 2010, up from 84mn b/d (+1mn b/d) in 2009. The US organisation expects a 0mn b/d upturn in OPEC oil and NGL output. Short-Term Supply Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 OPEC itself sees 2010 non-OPEC supply rising by 1mn b/d to 52mn b/d. In 2010, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional oils are expected to increase by 0mn b/d over the previous year to average 4mn b/d. The October 2010 OPEC monthly report argues that the call on OPEC crude is expected to average 28mn b/d, representing a downward adjustment of 100,000b/d from its previous assessment and a decline of 300,000b/d from the previous year. The IEAs 2010 assumption for non-OPEC oil supply is 52mn b/d, representing a rise of 1%. This view is based on output declines in Mexico, the UK and Norway, which partly offset the growth predicted for Brazil, Russia, China, India and Colombia. OPEC production of NGLs is expected to rise sharply from 4mn b/d to 5mn b/d. Increased biofuels supply (+15%) and a 3% downturn in processing gains implies a need for OPEC crude volumes of 29mn b/d in 2010. This is somewhat below OPECs estimated Q310 output of 29mn b/d.

Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Longer-Term Supply And Demand The BMI model predicts average annual oil demand growth of 1% between 2010 and 2015, followed by 1% between 2015 and 2020. After the forecast 2% global demand recovery in 2010, we are assuming 1% growth in 2011, followed by 1% in 2012, 1% in 2013, 1% in 2014 and 1% in 2015. OECD oil demand growth is expected to remain relatively weak throughout the forecast period to 2020, reflecting market maturity, the ongoing effects of recent demand destruction and the greater commitment to energy efficiency. Following the 4% decline in 2009 OECD oil consumption and the forecast 1% rise in 2010, we expect to see a decrease of 0% in 2011. On average, OECD demand is forecast to rise by 0% per annum in 2010-2015, then fall by 0% per annum in 2015-2020. For the non-OECD region, the demand trend in 2010-2015 is for 3% average annual market expansion, followed by 2% growth in 2015-2020. Demand growth is forecast to recover from 1% in 2009 to 3% in 2010 and 3% in 2011. BMI is forecasting global oil supply increasing by an average of 1% a year between 2010 and 2015, with an average yearly gain of 1% predicted in 2015-2020. We expect the trend to be at its weakest towards the end of the 10-year forecast period, with gains of just 0% and 0% predicted in 2019 and 2020. Non-OPEC oil production is expected to rise by an annual average of 0% in 2010-2015, then just 0% in 2015-2020. OPEC volumes are forecast to increase by an annual average of 3% between 2010 and 2015, easing to 2% per annum in 2015-2020. The IEA is predicting world oil demand growth of 1mn b/d in 2011, although it warns that if global GDP growth were to emerge a third lower, demand might increase by just 0mn b/d. Its current base case sees the world consuming 88mn b/d next year, up around 1%, which is in line with the latest BMI projection. The EIA is assuming world demand of 87mn b/d in 2011, up 1mn b/d, or 1%. This represents a more bullish view of likely macroeconomic and oil market events. OECD consumption is expected to continue falling, but the non-OECD countries are tipped to deliver 3% growth, with Chinese demand up by 5% well above our own view. OPECs assumption for 2011 is an increase in demand of around 1% to 86mn b/d, with this modest 1mn b/d rise in consumption the most conservative of third-party forecasts. It sees some growth among Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 OECD states, but a more cautious 2% increase from the non-OECD segment. Given that Chinas growth is put at 4%, this implies a very weak performance among the other developing countries. In terms of non-OPEC demand growth in 2011, the OPEC assumption is 360,000b/d, or 0%. The EIA is forecasting a decrease of 240,000b/d to 51mn b/d, which would allow OPEC to regain market share and inventories to fall. The IEAs prediction for 2011 is non-OPEC supply rising by 0mn b/d to 53mn b/d. In all cases, non-OPEC supply expansion fails by a wide margin to match likely growth in demand. This means that, even if the global economy falters and consumption fails to rise as quickly as expected, the slow growth in supply should still support robust crude prices. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Oil Price Assumptions The OPEC basket price, having averaged US$73/bbl in Q310, is forecast to be US$82in Q4. The full-year forecast is an average of US$77/bbl. Brent, WTI and Urals prices for 2010 are put at US$79, US$79and US$78/bbl respectively.

In 2011, there should be further growth in oil consumption. Non-OPEC supply is expected to increase by 0%, making room for OPEC to regain market share and for inventories to fall. We are assuming a further increase in the OPEC basket price to an average US$80/bbl, implying Brent at US$82, WTI at US$82/bbl and Urals at US$81. The basis here is for differentials to remain around the level of those seen in 2010, although greater volatility in the WTI and Brent markets could mean a different outcome. For 2012, we expect a further price rise to US$85 for OPEC crude thanks to still lower non-OPEC supply expansion and a slight strengthening of demand growth. Beyond 2012 we continue to use US$90/bbl for the OPEC basket.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Regional Energy Market Overview While Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the decade but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Russias gas deposits not only dominate regional supply but also represent the biggest single source for Western Europe. While consumer countries wish to diversify away from Russia, there are no other regional suppliers of note. LNG is not a major trade for the CEE region, although Russia began exporting gas in March 2009 from the Far Eastern Sakhalin projects into the Asia Pacific markets. Russian 2009/10 production surprised on the upside, with output fighting back after tax adjustments were introduced and modified. The countrys supply had fallen in 2008, ending a strong growth trend that began in 2000. We see little risk of a downturn in 2011, but the year could emerge as the near-term peak in output at 10mn b/d. A decline to 10mn b/d is thought likely in 2012/13, before increased investment delivers extra volumes of Russian crude and supply rises towards 10mn b/d in 2015, and to 11mn b/d by 2016/2017. The other regional issue is the Caspian states and their ability to meet production and export targets. The ultimate long-term potential is in little doubt, but a mixture of technical, commercial and political factors looks set hold back the rate of supply expansion. In 2009/10, the previously expected strong growth in output evaporated in the wake of persistent technical and commercial problems. Azerbaijan has some near-term upside. Kazakhstans near-term output growth potential is limited thanks to technical issues and the Kashagan field dispute, but longer-term prospects are good once Kashagan becomes a major contributor. CEE oil production is expected to average 13mn b/d in 2010. The region's output is expected to be 14mn b/d in 2011 and to reach 15mn b/d by 2015. In terms of demand, the estimated 2010 average of 6mn b/d is set to rise to 6mn b/d by 2015. This means that net exports from the region will climb steadily, from an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 to 8mn b/d by 2015.

Turkmenistan is expected to contribute 1% to regional oil production in 2010, with 2% expected in 2015. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total is forecast to rise to 7mn b/d in 2010 and reach 8mn b/d by 2015. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the key exporter.

Land boundaries mean pipeline transportation of gas is the favoured option, particularly from Russia through the CEE region into Western Europe. However, Russia became an LNG exporter in 2009 as Gazprom/Shells Sakhalin-II project entered production. Also, Poland is planning LNG imports as a means of diversifying supply away from Russia, while proposals are being discussed for a Croatian LNG terminal on the Adriatic coast, with imports possible by 2017. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Business Environment Ratings Central/Eastern Europe Region The CEE region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime. Oil production growth for the period to 2015 ranges from a negative 31% for Hungary to a positive 70% in Turkmenistan, while oil demand growth ranges from 9% to 40% across the region. Gas output is forecast to fall by 21% in Romania, but to rise 65% in Kazakhstan. The range for forecast gas consumption growth is from 13% to 65%. The political and economic environment varies, depending partly on market maturity and EU membership. Russia and the Caspian states are viewed as more volatile and less stable than the recent EU entrants. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Composite Scores Composite Business Environment scores are calculated using the average of individual upstream and downstream ratings. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan continue to dominate the top of the regional league table, taking first and second places with respective scores of 62 and 59 points out of a possible 100. Slovenia takes the final place in the rankings, with a composite upstream and downstream score of 41 points out of the 100 available. The points spread in the CEE region is considerably narrower than elsewhere, with the lowest-ranked country having 66% of the score allocated to the highest-ranked. Russia now shares fourth place with Turkey, with a medium-term chance of catching Poland above, but little hope of challenging the two leading Central Asian energy powerhouse states. Turkey is likely to remain a potential challenger for Polands position, while Romania and Ukraine are closely matched just above the middle of the league table, ahead of the Czech Republic with its limited upstream resource potential. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are competing with Bulgaria and Hungary to break out of the bottom half of the ranking, while Slovakia and Croatia are struggling to keep clear of Slovenia in last place.

Industry Rewards Industry Risks Country Rewards Rewards Country Risks Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream Business Environment ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Industry Rewards: On the basis of upstream data alone, Turkmenistan is actually the second most attractive state in the CEE region, behind only Kazakhstan. This reflects the fourth- and second-placed oil and gas reserves, the third-ranked oil production growth outlook, and fourth-placed gas production prospects. Country Rewards: Contributing to Turkmenistans third highest position in the Rewards section is its unenviable country rewards rating, which takes 13th place ahead only of Uzbekistan and Russia. The state has greater ownership of upstream assets than many in the region, and the industry is only somewhat competitive, with few non-state companies operational. Industry Risks: Turkmenistan is ranked second from last, ahead only of Russia, in the Risks section of our ratings. Its joint 13th position for industry risks with Slovenia is due to its licensing environment, and the fact that there is little immediate chance of privatisation of state-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is the second least attractive in the region, ranked 14th ahead only of Uzbekistan. The best, and only respectable, score is for long-term policy continuity. Corruption is the key risk for private companies. Furthermore, their ability to operate is weakened by the countrys low-scoring physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Downstream Scores Russia and Croatia now bracket the remaining 13 CEE states in the downstream rankings, with Turkey having been overtaken, as predicted in our last report, thanks to the size of Russias fuels market and refining capacity etc. Turkeys risk profile is substantially better and it may be able to retain regional leadership over the medium term. Poland now shares second place with Turkey and is also a potential regional leader. Ukraine is now two points behind Poland, and is unlikely to challenge it during the next few quarters. The Czech Republic and Romania are squabbling over fifth place, having edged ahead of Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan has now pulled clear of Uzbekistan, with the latter now tied with Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia near the foot of the table.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream Business Environment ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in 10th place, ahead of Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia. Medium-term scope exists for Turkmenistan to challenge Hungary above it. Industry Rewards: On the basis of downstream data alone, Turkmenistan ranks sixth above Romania among the regions 15 countries. This is attributable to the countrys ninth highest refining capacity, second highest gas demand growth outlook and joint third highest oil demand growth ranking. Country Rewards: Turkmenistan ranks eighth in terms of the Rewards section, although its country rewards rating holds last place in the region, behind even Uzbekistan and Slovenia. Growth in GDP per capita is the fifth highest for the entire region. Population ranks 11th and nominal GDP is the lowest in the region. Industry Risks: In the Risks section of our ratings, Turkmenistan is ranked 12th, just ahead of Ukraine. Its equal 11th place with Uzbekistan for industry risks reflects the challenging regulatory regime and the fact that there is little chance of near-term privatisation of government-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is ranked 13th, ahead only of Turkey and Ukraine. The scores for short-term policy continuity, short-term economic external risk and short-term economic growth risk are relatively high, but the country is let down by very low scores for legal framework, rule of law and physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Risk Summary Political Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov stated his desire to help rein in international problems such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and the proliferation of nationalist/radical religious groups in a speech to members of the National Security Ministry in September, specifically calling for improvements in preventing international criminal activities. Berdymukhamedov went on to more broadly state that Turkmenistan would continue to support international and interregional relationships, and this chimes well with our view that Turkmenistan would adopt a more open foreign policy over the coming years. According to the head of Turkmenistan's government agency, which manages state use of oil and gas resources, total investments within Turkmenistan's Production Sharing Agreement over the past three years have equalled approximately US$6bn, highlighting the success that Turkmenistan has had at attracting foreign investment into the country since it dispensed with economic isolation in 2006 upon the death of previous President Saparmurat Niyazov. We expect further investment into the economy over the coming years, particularly the energy sector given Turkmenistan's huge wealth of natural resources that will require developing. At an investment forum on October 19 2010, Turkmenistan signed an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in order to strengthen existing cooperation in the field of investments. Specifically, the EBRD and State Commercial Bank of Turkmenistan inked a Memorandum on Technical Assistance Turkmenistan also signed an agreement with the Islamic Development Bank under which the IDB will help to build a new dental centre in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat. Economic Business Environment Business Monitor International Ltd Page 38 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Industry Forecast Scenario Oil And Gas Reserves Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Statistical Review, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. We are assuming no dramatic change in reserves even as production rises, with around 570mn bbl remaining by 2014/15. Turkmenistan has proven gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm . All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. We are forecasting an increase in gas reserves to at least 10,000bcm during the forecast period. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. State-run China National Petroleum Corporation has made a major gas discovery in Turkmenistan, according to a September 2010 Reuters report. CNPC has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bcm of reserves. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 39 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, but rebounded to 206,000b/d in 2009. The government is targeting higherproduction, but the oil sector is strugglingto meet its growth goals owing to ashifting interest to gas production andlagging foreign investment. According toreports in 2007, Turkmenistan aims toproduce 2mn b/d by 2030, which seemsrather optimistic. The country exportsroughly half of its production. Local demand is an estimated 120,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI forecasts 2010 oil production averaging 220,000b/d, rising to 375,000b/d by 2015. Demand is forecast to increase from 120,000b/d to 158,000b/d by 2015, leaving export potential of up to 217,000b/d. Consultant GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum productive capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. While GCA has not commented on how quickly the field could be brought on stream, the suggested output levels would significantly add to the countrys production volumes. Companies from South Korea, the UAE and China have since been awarded US$9bn of contracts by the government to develop South Yolotan. These include CNPC, LG International and Petrofac International. The contracts will include drilling and building gas processing plants in the Yolotan region. Turkmengaz had planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm per annum by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in October 2009. The source said that the output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. BMI believes that actual 2010 volumes will fall well short of the targeted capacity, at around 65bcm.

He said the gas would be exported, but did not say what the destination would be. Iran was hoping to have added over 4bcmof Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency on April 23. Gazprom has contracted to transit only 10bcm of gas from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan in 2010, according to an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas. Under the terms of an agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat in December 2009, 30bcm were expected to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 65bcm in 2010 to 90bcm by 2014/15, with growth continuing beyond this point as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 21bcm to 31bcm during the period, so exports could reach 62bcm by 2014. Turkmenistan has two refineries, one at Chardzou and the other at Turkmenbashi, with a combined capacity of 237,000b/d. However, Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude.

The picture for oil export revenues is therefore relatively bright. Turkmenistan should have earned an estimated US$2bn in 2010, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$7bn by 2015. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2015 are US$20bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2015 total could be US$28bn, against an estimated US$15bn in 2010.

There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise with the higher export volumes. At a flat US$50/bbl oil price from now until 2015, petroleum export revenues would rise to US$15bn. However, at a flat US$100/bbl, the export 2015 export revenues would be US$31bn. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 54%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2020 is set to increase by 62%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 201,000b/d by 2020. Gas production Key Risks To BMIs Forecast Scenario Long-Term Oil And Gas Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 96bcm. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Oil And Gas Infrastructure Oil Refineries Turkmenistan has two refineries with a total capacity of 237,000b/d. One is at Chardzou, near the border with Uzbekistan, and has 120,493b/d capacity, while the other is at Turkmenbashi, with a crude processing capacity of 116,477b/d. Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised, however, and throughput represents only about half of nameplate capacity. Oil and oil products are exported from Turkmenistan by sea from the Kenar, Aladzha and Ekerem terminals. The throughput capacity of Kenar is 22mn bbl per year and it can accommodate tankers with a deadweight of up to 5,000 tonnes, while the Aladzha terminal has a throughput capacity of up to 17mn bbl of oil per year. The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year and the facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 deadweight tonnes. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Interconnector Pipeline May 2010, saw the launch of construction of the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum and construction is scheduled for completion in 2015. The pipeline will play Oil Storage Facilities The countrys main oil storage depot at Zerger was expanded in 2006 from a capacity of 124,666 bbl to its current capacity of 161,332 bbl. Oil Terminals/Ports Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 a critical role in gas exports, allowing gas to be transported to different export destinations according to market conditions and preferences. It is seen as vital part of plans for eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. Turkmenistan-Iran Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline, was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline. The second leg of the pipeline will run from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase is currently being built, with construction expected to be completed by year-end, brining the capacity to around 16bcm. He added that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Central Asian Gas Pipeline The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline is expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. A second parallel pipeline is expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Central Asia-Center Until recently, Soviet-era Central Asia-Center line to Russia was Turkmenistans sole export trunkline. Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on CAC in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under Business Monitor International Ltd Page 47 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India During his visit to Turkmenistan in November 2009, Eni's CEO Paolo Scaroni offered assistance to the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. The proposed TAPI pipeline would supply 32bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Officials from the governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a deal in Islamabad on April 24 2008 to buy gas from Turkmenistan. The mountainous terrain that the route would have to cross presents significant technical challenges, however, and the US-led war in Afghanistan means that the pipeline is a distant prospect. The four countries behind the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in September 2010 signed two preliminary deals confirming their support for the project. Although the security and political problems that have plagued the project have not yet been resolved, the signing of the deal is a clear statement of intent by the four partners. According to a Reuters report, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat on September 20. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan will receive 5Mcm/d from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 14Mcm/d afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline will include a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. In May 2010, the governments of Turkmenistan and India reiterated their commitment to increased gas exports from Turkmenistan to India. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Macroeconomic Outlook BMI View: According to state media, the Turkmen government is expecting to run a fiscal deficit in 2011 of US$707mn, with expenditures set to total US$22bn versus revenues of US$21bn. This would exceed the US$526mn budget shortfall estimated for 2010. However, the state has said that it will cover the shortfall using reserves. Heavy capital investment has helped push government spending up massively over the past few years, but the oil and gas sectors are expected to keep the fiscal accounts well supported for the foreseeable future.

IMF/BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Competitive Landscape Executive Summary The main government vehicle is state-owned Turkmenneft. IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. Petronas began producing from the Diyarbakir field in 2006. Petronas production increased from 4,700b/d of oil in the financial year ending March 31 2008 to 6,400b/d in FY08-09. In February 2008, Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2009, Eni produced an average of 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2008. The largest minority investor in oil explorer Dragon Oil has rejected a takeover bid from controlling shareholder ENOC that valued Dragon at US$3bn. In 2009, Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea. Germanys RWE Dea in July 2009 announced that it signed a PSA to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. RWE will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities at the block between 2010 and 2014. The State Information Agency of Turkmenistan announced the start of production at the Yylakly field in the Central Karakum desert in early July 2009. First oil from the field, which was developed by subsidiaries of Turkmenneft, was transported to an oil facility around 65km south of the field, which was inaugurated on the same day. From there, the oil was sent by rail to the system of pipelines connected to the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries. Production is expected to reach a peak of 1,095b/d. The development of the Mydar field, also in the Central Karakum desert, is expected to start soon, with daily output expected to reach up to 2,555b/d of oil. State-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary reported in August 2008 that the South Gutlyayak field is producing some 200,000cm/d of gas and condensate, equal to 73Mcm per annum.

Source: BMI Licensing And Regulation In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been production sharing agreements . The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energy, now owned by Italys Eni, produced an average of 12,000b/d in 2009. Petronas of Malaysia in 2006 began producing from the Diyarbakir field, with average production of 6,400b/d in FY08-09. Output from the offshore Cheleken block operated by Dragon Oil and Turkmenneft averaged 44,765b/d in 2008. Company 2009 Sales % share of total sales No. of employees Year Overview/State Role Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Government Policy President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn of cumulative investment in hydrocarbons sector by 2010, but the figure proved a serious overestimation. In 2010, the government believes it will receive US$4bn, up from US$2bn in 2009. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI at US$753mn. At least US$5bn per year over the next decade will need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMXs Jennifer Coolige argued there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be opening up under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya Basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. State-run Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. International Energy Relations Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan said in November 2009. This was not confirmed by Turkmen officials but in October 2010, government sources said Chervon and French major Total are negotiating their entrance into the Turkmen Caspian Shelf. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010, an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has been aggressively pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 54 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 In 2008 Russia paid US$140 per thousand cubic metres for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May. During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late 2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010 Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. An onward link to Tehran was completed by the Iranians in November 2010. The Dauletabad-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Iran has long been seen as a potential exporter of gas to Europe, or as a transit route for Central Asian gas. The completion of the second Turkmenistan-Iran gas pipeline makes this plan far more feasible. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 55 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 However, the main problems with the project have long been political rather than technological, with the EU currently opposed to Iranian gas imports. This stance appears to be justified by a US diplomatic communiqu released by website Wikileaks. According to the cable, Iran is interested in exporting gas to the EU in the belief that this will increase its political leverage and to help insulate it from sanctions. Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Tehran in February 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which covers a total of about 7,000km, transports gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline is expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. A second parallel pipeline is expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for EU External Relations Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with state-owned Turkmengaz in H110. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Business Monitor International Ltd Page 56 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. India and Turkmenistan have agreed to step up energy cooperation after high-level discussions during Turkmen president Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's first visit to India. The two sides expressed interest in several projects to transport Turkmen gas to India, including the long-mooted TAPI pipeline. However, BMI sees the political, security and technical challenges to the project as overwhelming making a gas-swap deal with Iran a more likely option. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries.

In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov.

In January 2008, Eni had secured 77% of Burren in an agreed GBP1bn. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In its latest annual report, Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2009, suggesting its existing producing assets have reached a plateau. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Latest Developments Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy in November 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. In April 2008, Turkmenistan refused to issue entry visas to Enis managers, illustrating the governments irritation that it was not consulted about Enis takeover of Burrens assets. However, operations are said to be continuing as normal as former Burren employees that are now working for Eni are allowed to continue to travel in and out of the country, according to an Eni spokesperson. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 59 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies pursuing a steady drilling effort in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Substantial domestic oil producer Strong relationship with government Early entrance into and established position in market Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Lack of developed infrastructure Opportunities: Rise in regional oil and gas consumption Long-term export opportunities Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address Dragon Oil Plc, ENOC House II,Third Floor Right Wing Sheikh Rashid Road Dubai, UAE Tel: +971 4 305 3660 Fax: +971 4 335 6954 www.dragonoil.com Financial Statistics Revenues: US$623mn US$706mn US$597mn US$325mn Net profit: US$259mn US$369mn US$304mn US$187mn Operating Statistics Oil production: 44,765b/d 40,992b/d 32,000b/d 20,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 60 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Market Position The Emirates National Oil Company , itself owned by the government of Dubai, holds a 52% share in London- and Dublin-listed Dragon Oil. The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of 8-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early 2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rising to a record 44,765b/d in 2009. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, down US$100mn from the 2009-2011 period. As of 2010 the company claims cumulative investment of US$1bn in the country. In late 2010 it announced plans to boost output to 75,000b/d, without specifying the projects involved. Dragon plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including five appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Latest Developments Dragon finished the first drilling and completion phase at two of its Caspian wells in November 2010. The Dzheitune B/148 and 28/149 development wells are part of a series to be drilled at the Dzheitune B platform offshore Turkmenistan. B/148 has been drilled to a depth of 3,858m and 28/149 reached a depth of 3,295m. In mid-May 2010, Dragon Oil issued details of contracts it had awarded to construct two rig platforms in its Cheleken contract area, in the Turkmen waters of the Caspian Sea. The company believes that the platforms, which will allow the drilling of up 16 new wells, will help the company achieve its production targets. The Dzhygalybeg A platform, to be built by Q112, will support a land rig and a jack-up rig and will allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Zhdanov field. The Dzheitune C platform, to be built by Q411, will support a jack-up rig and allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Lam Field. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 61 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 In April 2010, Dragon Oil announced that it had reached an agreement with a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company on a new short-term deal to replace a crude oil swap agreement that expired on 31 March 2010. The swap deal signed with NIOC subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company involves Dragon exporting its Turkmen crude to the Iranian Caspian port of Bandar Neka, where it is then marketed locally. In exchange, NIOC allocates Iranian crude oil to Dragon at the Kharg Island terminal, located in the Persian Gulf. Dragon Oil increased its 2009 full-year production by 9% to 44,765b/d of oil. The company put eight development wells into production in 2009. ENOCs takeover of Dragon Oil came to naught, with Dragon's largest minority shareholder rejecting the GBP4/share offer. Baillie Gifford & Co issued a statement on November 11 2009 claiming that the offer materially understates the fundamental and strategic value of Dragon Oil. Baillie Giffords clients holdings under its management amount to around 4% of the currently issued stock of Dragon, which is already 52% owned by ENOC. In August 2009, Dragon Oil released production test results from its Dzheitune 13/135 development well. The well was drilled to a depth of 3,302m and produced an initial flow rate of 1,320b/d of oil, which was slightly below Dragons expectations. The company said flows would improve, however, as the pressures in the gas-bearing zones are normalised. In June 2009, Dragon announced that it has successfully completed drilling the Dzheitune 28/134 development well, which was drilled to a total depth of 3,280m, using the Iran Khazar jackup rig. This well produced initial flow test rates of 2,685b/d and 869b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. In May 2009, Dragon Oil announced that it had completed testing its Dzheitune 13/133A development well, which is also located in the Caspian Sea. According to a company statement, the well produced flow test rates of 1,488b/d and 1,140b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. In July 2008, Dragon released a drilling update on its activities in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. The Dzheitune-22/128 development well was drilled to a depth of 3,848m and produced combined test flows of 2,600b/d of oil, according to a statement released to the Regulatory News Service. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Petronas Summary Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has told the Turkmen government that it could be producing up to 5bcm of gas from Block 1, with production expected to be increased to 10bcm at a later stage. Currently only oil is produced from the field. President Berdymukhamedov met Petronas former president, Hassan Marican, on May 15 2009 to discuss the companys Turkmenistan activities, according to Reuters. Petronas estimates that the field has 150bcm of reserves. In June 2009 Petronas said it would start installation work at Block 1 in early 2010. The facilities at the block will include a drilling platform, a wellhead platform and offshore pipelines. Offshore contractor Sigur Ros has signed a letter of intent to supply the crew and equipment required for the pipe laying work. First gas from the first phase of the block was scheduled for Q310 but appears to have been delayed. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. CNPC has reported what appears to be a major gas discovery in September 2010. CNPC reported that exploration well Oja-21 in Block B maintained a flow of 1mn Mcm/d of gas and 36cm/d of condensate during testing. The company has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bn bcm of reserves. PetroChina said in early September 2009 that it would pay US$1bn to its parent company CNPC for its share of the Amu Darya Right Bank gas field in Turkmenistan. The field, which is scheduled to come China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 63 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 onstream by the end of 2009, is earmarked to supply the second West-East gas pipeline that will transport gas to Shanghai. Gazprom Summary Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. In April 2003, the Russian and Turkmen presidents signed a bilateral cooperation agreement covering natural gas, which will remain in force from January 1 2004 until December 31 2028. Within the deal, state-controlled Turkmenneftegaz agreed a contract for the supply of Turkmen natural gas over the same period. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 in its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal on September 13 2009 with Turkmenistan to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which have been tense since April following an explosion on Itera Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 64 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite its dispute with Gazprom. Discussions on the project had been ongoing since February 18. By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its former partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for 16 years and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman Igor Makarov, this is the first time the company has been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Preliminary estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas a year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April when RWEs CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistans President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which has been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3D seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. The company in April 2010 said it would invest US$60-80mn at the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. The deal is yet to materialise. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil has returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010 in response to earlier media reports. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall RWE Summary Others Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 65 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Canadian-registered independent Buried Hill Energy claimed that it signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan, confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Petrofac Among the Western firms, Petrofac has gained a major first mover advantage in Turkmenistan, winning a deal to develop the giant South Yolotan field on behalf of state-run TurkmenGaz in 2009. After completing work on the first phase of the project in December 2009, Petrofac announced that it began working on the second phase in December 2010. The project's US$3bn second phase is expected to be completed in mid-2013. The second phase will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. South Yolotan is Petrofacs only project in the country at the moment. Service Companies Business Monitor International Ltd Page 66 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Oil And Gas Outlook: Long-Term Forecasts Regional Oil Demand A slight strengthening of the 2010-2015 oil demand trend is predicted for the 2015-2020 period, reflecting the economic weakness prevailing in the earlier period, as well as the under-developed nature of several key economies, ongoing wealth generation thanks to rising export volumes, plus the maturing of new EU member states. The regions oil consumption is expected to increase by 13% in 2015-2020, after 13% growth in the period 2010-2015. Over the extended 2010 to 2020 forecast period, Azerbaijan leads the way, with oil demand increasing by an estimated 96%, followed by Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (+62%) and Kazakhstans 39% growth. Hungary lags the field, as a result of greater market maturity and the lack of hydrocarbons income that stimulates economies elsewhere in the region.

Cheap and plentiful local crude supplies help make it a region of choice for refinery investment, although government control of the downstream industry will need to be eased. Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, Turkey and Bulgaria have particularly ambitious expansion plans, reflecting either crude output growth or local demand expansion.

Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 96bcm. Methodology And Risks To Forecasts In terms of oil and gas supply, as well as refining capacity, the projections are wherever possible based on known development projects, committed investment plans or stated government/company intentions. A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historical reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

Our approach has been threefold. First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all 16 industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline Oil & Gas BER is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of Upstream/Downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients, who will have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite for their operations. Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% Upstream BER and 50% Downstream BER: Upstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Upstream rating which is composed of limits/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Downstream rating which comprises limits/risks . Both the Upstream BER and Downstream BER are composed of Limits/Risks sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader Country Risk components: Limits of Potential Returns: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Ratings Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 74 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Risks to Realisation of those Returns: Evaluates both Industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 78 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts BMI's industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 79 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2011 Energy Industry There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy Supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: national energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; international quotas, guidelines and projections, such as OPEC, IEA, US Energy Information Administration . Energy Consumption A mixture of methods is used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historical relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts, based on company- or state-specific investment levels Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third-party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Cross Checks Sources Sources include those international bodies mentioned above, such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news agencies.

............................................................................................................................................................... 79 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Executive Summary The new Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report from BMI forecasts that the country will account for 2% of Central and Eastern European regional oil demand by 2014, while providing 2% of supply. CEE regional oil use of 5mn barrels per day in 2001 will rise to an estimated 6mn b/d in 2010. It should increase to around 6mn b/d by 2014. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001, and in 2010 will average an estimated 13mn b/d. It is set to rise to 14mn b/d by 2014. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total will rise to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 7mn b/d by 2014. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the key exporter. In terms of natural gas, the region in 2010 consumed an estimated 638bn cubic metres , with demand of 728bcm targeted for 2014, representing 14% growth. Production of an estimated 788bcm in 2010 should reach 936bcm in 2014, which implies net exports rising from an estimated 149bcm in 2010 to 207bcm by the end of the period. Turkmenistans share of consumption in 2010 is an estimated 3%, while its share of production is put at 8%. By 2014, its share of demand is forecast to be 3%, with the country accounting for 9% of supply. For 2010 as a whole, we continue to assume an average OPEC basket price of US$83/bbl, +36% year-on-year . Risk is now clearly on the downside, thanks to the slow progress made during June. However, a full-year outturn in excess of US$80 remains a strong possibility and we see no need to review our assumptions at this point. The 2010 US WTI price is now put at US$87/bbl. BMI is assuming an OPEC basket price of US$85/bbl in 2011, with WTI averaging US$89. Our central assumption for 2012 and beyond is an OPEC price averaging US$90/bbl, delivering WTI at just over US$95For 2010, the BMI assumption for premium unleaded gasoline is an average global price of US$95/bbl. The overall y-o-y rise in 2010 gasoline prices is put at 36%. Gasoil in 2010 is expected to average US$93/bbl. The full-year outturn represents a 35% increase from the 2009 level. For 2010, the annual jet price level is forecast to be US$95/bbl. This compares with US$70/bbl in 2009. The 2010 average naphtha price is put by BMI at US$83/bbl, up 41% from the previous years level. Turkmen real GDP is assumed by BMI to have risen by 8% in 2010. We are assuming average annual growth of 9% in 2010-2014. Domestic consumption trends can be expected to return to a strong growth tack in 2010, estimated at an average of 5% per annum. By 2014, the country could be using 150,000b/d of oil. Turkmenistan has traditionally been protective of its onshore basins, allowing international oil companies to participate only in offshore developments. Offshore activity should help raise Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 national crude and gas liquids output from an estimated 220,000b/d in 2010 to 350,000b/d by 2014. Gas production is expected to increase from an estimated 65bcm to 90bcm between 2010 and 2014. Between 2010 and 2019, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 57%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 346,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2019 is set to increase by 55%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 192,000b/d by 2019. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 125bcm by 2019, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 84bcm. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Turkmenistan now takes ninth place in BMIs composite Business Environment ratings table, which combines upstream and downstream scores. It now shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream Business Environment ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream Business Environment ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in 10th place, ahead of Uzbekistan. Medium-term scope exists for Turkmenistan to challenge Hungary above it. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Political SWOT Strengths Common strategic interests will smooth regional relations with Turkmenistan's energy-hungry neighbours such as China, and possibly even the EU. Weaknesses Despite growing discontent over increased repression and corruption, there is little prospect of an organised opposition gaining a foothold. Harsh methods will be used to suppress public protest, and multimillion-dollar contracts signed with Western companies will mute business support. Opportunities The stable transition of power after Saparmurat Niyazov's death is a positive sign of political stability. President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedovs early policies indicate that he may be willing to forge greater trade and business links with foreign countries. Threats Turkmenistan will remain one of the world's most restrictive societies, and with few of the benefits from increased hydrocarbon sales reaching the population, there remains some risk of civil uprising. Turkmenistan Economic SWOT Strengths Economic activity will be supported by the ongoing expansion of energy production and exports, ensuring strong growth in the medium term. The government's ambitious strategy for a fivefold increase in real GDP between 2000 and 2010 will encourage efforts to boost sustainability in all sectors of the economy. Weaknesses The official economic figures remain unreliable, reflecting the legacy of the Soviet era when only 'positive data' were released. With fiscal management opaque, international financial institutions will continue to find it hard to analyse and support Turkmenistan's economic development. The persistence of central planning, with government use of production targets and mandatory state procurement, will prevent efficient resource allocation, risking shortages of consumer goods, inflationary pressure and stunted growth. Opportunities A gas pipeline to China, currently under construction, will help diversify the country's export markets. Moreover, the country is also considering diversifying its gas export routes to Europe, bypassing Russia. The trade surplus provides an opportunity for the government to diversify the economy. Threats Trade levels will continue to fluctuate greatly while gas markets remain vulnerable to interruptions in pipeline access and external shocks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Turkmenistan Business Environment SWOT Strengths Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2009. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm, ranking it among the worlds top five countries. Weaknesses Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow have soured, following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Opportunities Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. The country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. In May 2007, the chairman of state company Turkmengaz, Yashygeldy Kakayev, said the countrys energy strategy was to almost double gas production to 120bcm by 2010 and more than treble production to 240bcm by 2030. Threats Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Turkmenistan Energy Market Overview Once-isolationist Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many international oil companies had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. Some, however, have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of around 8,100bcm , ranking it among the worlds top five countries. The country contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya Basin in the east, the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian Basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. The revision puts reserve estimates above the high estimate made by UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates when it conducted the first independent assessment of the field in October 2008. GCA put the field's low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm. Companies from South Korea, the UAE and China have been awarded US$9bn of contracts by the government to develop South Yolotan. These companies include China National Petroleum Corporation , LG International and Petrofac International. The contracts will include drilling and building gas processing plants in the Yolotan region. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. State-owned Turkmengaz hoped to have increased its production capacity to 100bcm per annum by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in October 2009. The Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 source said that the output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The news suggests that Turkmenistan is looking beyond the end of its current dispute with Russia to the possibility of export deals that will require additional production capacity. Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Review, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to 206,000b/d in 2009. The government targets higher production, but the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals because of a shifting interest to gas production and lagging foreign investment. The country exports around half of its production. Local demand is estimated at 120,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. In February 2008, the president introduced a new fuels retail system providing transportation customers with free gasoline up to a specified level and charging a market rate, established by the state, for amounts exceeding the quota. Turkmenistan has two major refineries, the Seidi and Turkmenbashi, with a combined total capacity of 237,000b/d . Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. In terms of electricity, Turkmenistans installed generating capacity is estimated at 3gigawatts , with recent generation put at around 17terawatt hours . With consumption averaging around 9TWh, there is a useful net export capability. Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energyis now owned by Italys Eni group. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Turkmenistan is set to open development of its offshore Caspian oil deposits to US majors for the first time. Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov in August 2010 selected US majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips as well as US-based TX Oil and Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Oil and Gas to develop blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian Sea, according to Reuters quoting state television. At least US$5bn per annum over the next decade needs to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg. CMX consultant Jennifer Coolige argued in the report that there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Global Oil Market Review Drifting With The Tide Although Q2 started with encouraging oil market strength, this had largely dissipated by the end of the quarter. Little changed in terms of oil market fundamentals but there was a major shift in sentiment among investors and forecasters. Eurozone economic woes, China jitters and a general sense of macroeconomic fragility meant that oil prices were dragged lower with equities and currencies. Crude once again became a stock market proxy, with little enthusiasm for the commodity. Seemingly endless bad news from the Gulf of Mexico hardly helped encourage oil market speculation, as BPs very public battle with US President Obama cast a shadow over future upstream developments and oil company prospects. None of this was actually negative in terms of near-term price prospects, but investors needed little excuse to avoid oil. Demand projections for 2010 continued to firm up during the second quarter, even though the jury is still out regarding the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery. The imposition of tougher sanctions by the UN against Iran failed to increase oil market tension. Inventories have changed little and OPEC policy appears to be one of ignoring likely over-supply in the hope that it will go away without action being required. According to the International Energy Agency s July 2010 monthly Oil Market Report , OECD end-May commercial oil inventories stood at 2,757mn barrels , up 35mn bbl from the April level. This increase was broadly in line with the five-year average stock build, representing a relatively benign development. More worrying, perhaps, is an estimated build of 3mn bbl in June, at a time when a draw of around 8mn bbl is usually expected. Crude stocks emerged lower, but this improvement was outweighed by a products gain largely in the US. In terms of production, the worrying OPEC output trend seen earlier in the year appears to have been reversed or, at least, stabilised. June saw global oil supply fall by more than 250,000 barrels per day according to the IEA. OPEC and non-OPEC producers saw volumes fall during the month. Crude oil supply from OPEC averaged 28mn b/d in June , down by 65,000b/d when compared with the previous month. Much of this reduction, however, reflects Iraqi cutbacks, with the 11 core members actually increasing supply by some 40,000b/d. Quota compliance of around 59% is now pretty stable and close to the historical OPEC norm. Non-OPEC supply in Q2 has been fairly stable when compared with the first quarter, but has shown a clear weakening trend during the three months. Output of around 52mn b/d in April slipped to 52mn b/d in May and emerged still lower at around 52mn b/d in June. Among the major contributors to the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 June downturn were Norway and the US. Average Q210 non-OPEC supply is put at around 52mn b/d, compared with 52mn b/d in Q1. Quarterly Trends The Energy Information Administration in its July 2010 monthly report suggested that Q210 global oil demand was 85mn b/d, compared with 85mn b/d in Q110 and 83mn b/d in Q209. Non-OECD demand is reported at 40mn b/d, compared with 39mn b/d in the previous quarter and 39mn b/d in Q209. The OECD states saw a 1mn b/d quarter-on-quarter fall in consumption during Q210, amounting to 44mn b/d. In Q209, OECD demand was 44mn b/d, based on EIA data. According to the Paris-based IEA, Q210 global consumption averaged 86mn b/d, compared with 86mn b/d in Q110 and 83mn b/d in Q209. The y-o-y change was a gain of 3%. OECD demand in Q210 is reported at 45mn b/d, compared with 45mn b/d in Q110 and 44mn b/d in Q209. Non-OECD consumption in Q210 was reportedly up 4% y-o-y at 41mn b/d. In Q110, non-OECD consumption was 40mn b/d. OPECs July 2010 monthly oil report states Q210 global oil demand at 84mn b/d, down from 84mn b/d during the previous quarter and up from 83mn b/d in Q209 (+1%). OECD demand is said to have risen by 0% y-o-y, with North American consumption higher by 1%. Non-OECD demand was up 2% y-o-y, according to the OPEC data. The EIA Q210 estimates suggest that non-OPEC oil supply was 51mn b/d, compared with the Q110 level of 51mn b/d and the 49mn b/d recorded in Q209. Russia, the US and Canada were significant contributors to the supply increase. OPEC output for Q210 is put at 34mn b/d, up from 34mn b/d in Q110 and the 33mn b/d delivered in the second quarter of 2009. Global Q210 production based on IEA data was an average 86mn b/d. This compares with 86mn b/d in Q110. The non-OPEC element for the most recent quarter is 52mn b/d, easing lower from 52mn b/d in Q1. Overall OPEC volumes, including gas liquids, are said to have fallen from 34mn b/d to 34mn b/d between Q110 and Q210. OPEC itself believes that non-OPEC oil supply averaged 52mn b/d in Q210. OPEC crude output was assessed at 29mn b/d during the quarter, with the cartel pumping an average 29mn b/d in June. There will be lasting repercussions resulting from the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. It is inconceivable that deepwater drilling programmes will not be revised and disrupted as a result of the Deepwater Turbulence Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 record-breaking oil spill that appears to be threatening BPs future. Ultra-deepwater discoveries and development represent a significant part of the non-OPEC oil industrys growth potential. Even in countries that are less sensitive than the US to environmental issues, we can expect to see higher costs, modified methods of operation and project delays as the industry responds to this fresh challenge. Preliminary estimates from the EIA in the wake of the deepwater drilling moratorium announced by US Energy Secretary Ken Salazar in late May suggest a shortfall in US supply of around 31,000b/d in Q410 and about 82,000b/d in 2011. The IEA believes that delays to new projects resulting from the Macondo oil spill have already shaved 30,000b/d off both 2010 and 2011 US crude production. It warns that extended project delays could reduce its 2015 projection for US Gulf production by100,000b/d 300,000b/d. On June 22, a US district court judge lifted the partial deepwater drilling moratorium, arguing that it was too broad a measure that discriminated against companies with untainted safety records. Damage to the regional economy and to the US energy industry was no doubt another factor taken into consideration. On July 8, an appeals court backed the decision, but the Obama administration is believed to be considering a more focused moratorium. At present, however, there is no deepwater drilling in the GoM. In the US Congress, a wave of proposed legislation is making progress through various committees, with key proposals including new safety measures, increased demands on companies active in deepwater drilling, greatly enhanced liability for operators and a possible ban on drilling within 75 miles of the US coastline. Once a framework is in place, other countries with deepwater prospects can be expected to adopt some or all of the US measures. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger has called for an EU deepwater drilling moratorium, although there appears to be limited support and equally limited risk. The North Sea has less deepwater potential than other regions, with pretty demanding regulation already in place. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Global Oil Market Outlook Waiting For The Wind To Change With fair winds and following seas, oil prices could gather momentum during the remaining months of 2010, moving briskly ahead after a period in the doldrums. Market fundamentals are generally favourable but a wave of negative sentiment needs to be overcome before progress can be made. Oil has recently become a victim of broader macroeconomic pessimism, tracking equity and currency trends rather than energy market conditions. If stock markets can gain ground in the third quarter, crude and products prices should follow them higher. Looking ahead to 2011, the supply and demand picture is again reasonably attractive and should be able to support further modest oil price gains. Our 2010 target of US$83per barrel for the OPEC basket price is still just about attainable, but only if a recovery gets underway soon and can be sustained throughout H2. The demand side of the equation looks reasonable and supply risk is arguably more on the downside from here. Inventories continue to be an area of concern but, overall, the oil market looks in reasonable shape for a mildly bullish phase. Any momentum gained during the second half of 2010 should be carried through into 2011. Oil demand growth next year is likely to fall somewhat short of the forecast 2010 level, reflecting OECD efforts to reduce oil dependency in the wake of high fuel prices and environmental initiatives. Helping offset this factor is a likely slowing of non-OPEC supply expansion. With potential delays and cost overruns in the frontier areas following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, volumes are expected to grow more slowly. This provides breathing space for OPEC, which will hope to regain a little market share during 2011. In terms of the OPEC basket of crudes, the average price in Q210 was US$76/bbl, up modestly from the US$75/bbl recorded during the previous three months. In Q209, the OPEC price averaged US$58/bbl, so the most recent quarter has seen a year-on-year gain of 30%. Prior to the weekly average low of US$68reached in late May 2010, the OPEC basket had been as high as US$83/bbl at the beginning of that month. Becalmed in much of June and July, the price traded in a narrow range of US$71-74/bbl. The monthly averages for the second quarter of 2010 have been US$82, US$74and US$72/bbl. BMI is currently assuming that July will deliver an average close to US$76 if the price rallies as expected from here. In terms of other marker prices, North Sea Brent averaged US$78/bbl during Q2, with WTI achieving US$77, Urals at US$76/bbl and Dubai realising an average US$78Oil Price Forecasts Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 These averages have been calculated using OPEC data and monthly prices from the International Energy Agency . As mentioned above, the BMI assumption for July 2010 OPEC crude is US$76/bbl and, for the third quarter we are expecting an average of US$86/bbl. This suggests a 13% strengthening of quarterly realisations when compared with Q210 and a y-o-y gain of US$19/bbl when compared with Q309 (+28%). For 2010 as a whole, we continue to assume an average OPEC basket price of US$83/bbl (+36% yo-y). This is the forecast introduced in our October 2009 quarterly report. Risk is now clearly on the downside, thanks to the slow progress made during June. However, a full-year outturn in excess of US$80/bbl remains a strong possibility and we see no need to review our assumptions at this point. Any failure of prices to rally significantly in Q3 will mean a downgrade in our October quarterly report. The 2010 US West Texas Intermediate price is now put at US$87/bbl. The July 2010 monthly report from the US-based Energy Information Administration predicts a 2010 average WTI crude price of just under US$79/bbl, rising to US$83in 2011. BMI is assuming an OPEC basket price of US$85/bbl in 2011, with WTI averaging US$89. Our central assumption for 2012 and beyond is an OPEC price averaging US$90/bbl, delivering WTI at just over US$95/bbl. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Oil Supply, Demand And Price Outlook Short-Term Demand Outlook The BMI oil supply and demand assumptions for 2010 and beyond have once again been revised for all 71 countries forming part of our detailed coverage, reflecting the changing macroeconomic outlook and the impact of environmental initiatives. Investment in exploration, development and new production has been rising as a result of higher crude prices, but deepwater activity has been set back by events in the GoM. Costs associated with oil field development and exploration/appraisal drilling have begun to rise again, with deepwater programmes now particularly vulnerable. We have once again made only modest changes to forecast oil production levels, in line with recent OPEC output and known project delays, with no clear evidence of large-scale spending changes by international oil companies or national oil companies . According to the updated BMI model, 2010 global oil consumption will now increase by 2% from the 2009 level. This represents an upgrade to the forecast contained in the April 2010 quarterly report. The 2010 forecast represents slightly higher OECD demand (+0%) and a revised non-OECD increase of 3%. The overall increase in demand is estimated at 1mn b/d. North America is now expected to see expansion of 244,000b/d (+1%), with OECD European demand set to recover by 142,000b/d (+1%). Non-OECD gains are expected to be 2% in Asia, 1% in Latin America, 3% in Central/Eastern Europe, 4% in the Middle East and 1% in Africa. The IEA, in its July 2010 Oil Market Report, predicts a slightly more bullish rise in 2010 oil demand of 2%, or 1mn b/d. The organisations assumptions suggest an impressive 4% rise in non-OECD consumption (+1mn b/d). This points to 0% higher OECD oil demand, lagging the likely economic recovery and any weather-related benefits accrued in Q1. July 2010 EIA estimates suggest that world demand will rise y-o-y from 84mn b/d to 85mn b/d, with the 1mn b/d increase in consumption amounting to a gain of 1%. This view sits just below the somewhat more optimistic BMI assumption and the IEAs still more generous estimate. Non-OECD demand is predicted to increase by 3% , while OECD demand is expected to rise by just 30,000b/d . Consumption in the US is expected to increase by 200,000 b/d . With Canadian demand 3% higher and that of Europe 0% lower, it is in Japan that the US energy body sees the greatest risk of a decline forecasting a fall of 3%. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 OPECs July 2010 report suggests a likely increase in 2010 global oil consumption of 0mn b/d, or 1%. OECD demand is forecast to fall by 150,000b/d . Non-OECD demand is expected to average 40mn b/d, compared with 38mn b/d in 2009 (+2%).

Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. According to the revised BMI model, 2010 global oil production will rise by 2%, representing an OPEC increase of 3% and a non-OPEC gain of 1%. The overall increase in supply is estimated at 2mn b/d in 2010, which represents an upgrade from the forecast delivered by the April 2010 quarterly report. We continue to assume that the existing OPEC production ceiling will be retained for the whole of 2010, but that actual output will remain close to the Q210 level. Should quota adherence deteriorate further, then OPEC volumes could emerge rather higher. The EIA was in July 2010 forecasting a 620,000b/d y-o-y rise in non-OPEC oil output, representing a gain of 1%. World oil production is predicted to be 85mn b/d in 2010, up from 84mn b/d (+1mn b/d) in 2009. The US organisation expects a 1mn b/d upturn in OPEC oil and natural gas liquids output. Short-Term Supply Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 OPEC itself sees 2010 non-OPEC supply rising by 740,000b/d to 51mn b/d. In 2010, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional oils are expected to increase by 0mn b/d over the previous year to average 4mn b/d. The July 2010 OPEC monthly report argues that the call on OPEC crude is expected to average 28mn b/d, representing a downward adjustment of 105,000b/d from its previous assessment and a decline of 300,000b/d from the previous year. This suggests little scope for members to raise output. The IEAs 2010 assumption for non-OPEC oil supply is 52mn b/d, representing a rise of 1%. This somewhat cautious view is based on output declines in Mexico, the UK and Norway, which offset partly the growth predicted for Brazil, Russia, China, India and Colombia. OPEC production of NGLs is expected to rise sharply from 4mn b/d to 5mn b/d. Increased biofuels supply (+16%) and a slight downturn in processing gains imply a need for OPEC crude volumes of 28mn b/d in 2010. This is very close to OPECs estimated Q210 output.

Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Longer-Term Supply And Demand The BMI model predicts average annual oil demand growth of 1% between 2010 and 2014, followed by 1% between 2014 and 2019. After the forecast 2% global demand recovery in 2010, we are assuming 1% growth in 2011, followed by 1% in 2012, 1% in 2013 and 1% in 2014. OECD oil demand growth is expected to remain relatively weak throughout the forecast period to 2019, reflecting market maturity, the ongoing effects of recent demand destruction and the greater commitment to energy efficiency. Following the 4% decline in 2009 OECD oil consumption and the forecast 0% rise in 2010, we expect to see a decrease of 0% in 2011. On average, OECD demand is forecast to rise by 0% per annum in 2010-2014, then fall by 0% per annum in 2014-2019. For the non-OECD region, the demand trend in 2010-2014 is for 3% average annual market expansion, followed by 2% in 2014-2019. Demand growth is forecast to recover from 1% in 2009 to 3% in 2010 and 3% in 2011. BMI is forecasting global oil supply increasing by an average 1% annually between 2010 and 2014, with an average yearly gain of 1% predicted in 2014-2019. We expect the trend to be at its weakest towards the end of the 10-year forecast period, with gains of just 1% and 0% predicted in 2018 and 2019. Non-OPEC oil production is expected to rise by an annual average of 0% in 2010-2014, then 0% in 2014-2019. OPEC volumes are forecast to increase by an annual average of 2% between 2010 and 2014, rising to 3% per annum in 2014-2019. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Oil Price Assumptions The OPEC basket price, having averaged an estimated US$76/bbl in Q210, is forecast to be US$86in Q3 and US$93/bbl in Q4. The full year forecast remains an average of US$83/bbl. Brent, WTI and Urals prices for 2010 are put at US$84, US$87and US$83/bbl respectively.

By 2011, there should be further growth in oil consumption and more room for OPEC to regain market share and reduce surplus capacity through higher production quotas. We are assuming a further increase in the OPEC basket price to an average US$85/bbl, implying Brent at US$87, WTI at US$89/bbl and Urals at US$85. For 2012 and beyond, we continue to use a central case forecast of US$90/bbl for the OPEC basket.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Regional Energy Market Overview While Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the decade but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Russias gas deposits not only dominate regional supply but also represent the biggest single source for Western Europe. While consumer countries wish to diversify away from Russia, there are no other regional suppliers of note. LNG is not a major trade for the CEE region, although Russia began exporting gas in March 2009 from the Far Eastern Sakhalin projects into the Asia Pacific markets. Russian 2009/10 production surprised on the upside, with output fighting back after tax adjustments were introduced and modified. The countrys supply had fallen in 2008, ending a strong growth trend that began in 2000. We see little risk of a downturn in 2011, but the year could emerge as the near-term peak in output at 10mn b/d. A decline to 10mn b/d is thought likely by 2013, before increased investment delivers extra volumes of Russian crude and supply rises towards 11mn b/d by 2016/2017. The other regional issue is the Caspian states and their ability to meet production and export targets. The ultimate long-term potential is in little doubt, but a mixture of technical, commercial and political factors looks set hold back the rate of supply expansion. In 2009/10, the previously expected strong growth in output evaporated in the wake of persistent technical and commercial problems. Azerbaijan has some near-term upside. Kazakhstans near-term output growth potential is limited thanks to technical issues and the Kashagan field dispute, but longer-term prospects are good once Kashagan becomes a major contributor. CEE oil production is expected to have averaged 13mn b/d in 2010. The region's output is expected to be 13mn b/d in 2011 and to reach 14mn b/d by 2014. In terms of demand, the estimated 2010 average of 6mn b/d is set to rise to 6mn b/d by 2014. This means that net exports from the region will climb steadily, from an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 to 7mn b/d by 2014.

Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001, and in 2010 averaged an estimated 13mn b/d. It is set to rise to 14mn b/d by 2014. Turkmenistan will have contributed an estimated 1% to 2010 regional oil production, with a forecast market share of 2% by 2014. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average 3mn b/d. This total had risen to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 7mn b/d by 2014. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the key exporter.

Capacity expansion will lag that in most other emerging regions, although Russia plans a processing boost and the likes of Poland and Kazakhstan should also build new or expand existing facilities. The regions total capacity is forecast to reach 10mn b/d by 2014 well ahead of oil demand, therefore implying substantial net exports of refined products. Turkmenistan in 2010 has an estimated 2% of regional refining capacity, with a market share of 2% forecast for 2014.

Land boundaries mean pipeline transportation of gas is the favoured option, particularly from Russia through the CEE region into Western Europe. However, Russia became an LNG exporter in 2009 as Gazprom/Shells Sakhalin-II project entered production. Also, Poland is planning LNG imports as a means of diversifying supply away from Russia, while proposals are being discussed for a Croatian LNG terminal on the Adriatic coast, with imports possible by 2017. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 29 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Business Environment Ratings Central/Eastern Europe Region The CEE region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime. Oil production growth for the period to 2014 ranges from a negative 27% for Croatia to a positive 56% in Turkmenistan, while oil demand growth ranges from 6% to 31% across the region. Gas output is forecast to fall by 18% in Romania, but rise 55% in Azerbaijan. The range for forecast gas consumption growth is from 10% to 81%. The political and economic environment varies, depending partly on market maturity and EU membership. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Composite Scores Composite Business Environment scores are calculated using the average of individual upstream and downstream ratings. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan continue to dominate the top of the regional league table, taking first and second places with respective scores of 62 and 59 points out of a possible 100. Slovenia takes the final place in the rankings, with a composite upstream and downstream score of 38 points out of the 100 available. The points spread in the CEE region is considerably narrower than elsewhere, with the lowest-ranked country having 61% of the score allocated to the highest-ranked. Russia now shares third place with Turkey, but with no immediate chance of catching the two main Central Asian energy powerhouse states. Poland is likely to remain a potential challenger for Turkeys position, while Romania and Ukraine are closely matched just above the middle of the league table, ahead of the Czech Republic with its limited upstream resource potential. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are competing with Hungary to break out of the bottom half of the ranking, while Slovakia and Croatia are struggling to keep clear of Slovenia in last place.

Azerbaijan is second, itself having a very useful 18-point lead over Poland and Russia. Turkmenistans hydrocarbons resources mean it is nearing the mid-point of the league table, challenging Croatia and Uzbekistan. Bulgaria and Romania are squabbling over sixth place, while Slovakia and Ukraine are tied for 11th just ahead of Hungary.

The Upstream BE Rating is the principal rating. It comprises two sub- ratings Rewards and Risks, which have a 70% and 30% weighting respectively. In turn, the Rewards Rating comprises Industry Rewards and Country Rewards, which have a 75% and 25% weighting respectively. They are based upon the oil and gas resource base/growth outlook and sector maturity and the broader industry competitive environment . The Risks rating comprises Industry Risks and Country Risks which have a 65% and 35% weighting respectively and are based on a subjective evaluation of licensing terms and liberalisation and the industrys broader Country Risks exposure , which is based on BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings. The ratings structure is aligned across the 14 Industries for which BMI provides Business Environment Ratings methodology, and is designed to enable clients to consider each rating individually or as a composite, with the choice depending on their exposure to the industry in each particular state.

Industry Rewards Industry Risks Country Rewards Rewards Country Risks Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan now shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream Business Environment ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Industry Rewards: On the basis of upstream data alone, Turkmenistan is actually the joint third most attractive state in the CEE region, alongside Russia. This reflects the fourth- and second-placed oil and gas reserves, the third-ranked oil production growth outlook, and fourth-placed gas production prospects. Country Rewards: Contributing to Turkmenistans third highest position in the Rewards section is its unenviable country rewards rating, which takes 13th place ahead only of Uzbekistan and Russia. The state has greater ownership of upstream assets than many in the region, and the industry is only somewhat competitive, with few non-state companies operational. Industry Risks: Turkmenistan is ranked equal second from last, alongside Ukraine and ahead only of Russia in the Risks section of our ratings. Its joint 13th position for industry risks with Slovenia is due to its licensing environment, and the fact that there is little immediate chance of privatisation of state-held assets. Country Risks: Its broader country risks environment is among the least attractive in the region, ranked equal ninth alongside Azerbaijan and Romania. The best, and only respectable, score is for long-term policy continuity. Corruption is the key risk for private companies. Furthermore, their ability to operate is weakened by the countrys low-scoring physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Downstream Scores Turkey and Bulgaria/Croatia now bracket the remaining 13 CEE states in the downstream rankings, with Turkey vulnerable to assault by second-placed Russia, thanks to the size of the latters fuels market and refining capacity etc. Turkeys risk profile is substantially better and it may be able to retain regional leadership over the medium term. Poland is just two points further back than Russia and also a potential regional leader. Ukraine is just one point behind Poland, but is unlikely to challenge it during the next few quarters. Azerbaijan and Romania are squabbling over fifth place, having edged ahead of the Czech Republic and Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan is now just a point clear of Uzbekistan, while there is little to choose between Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia near the foot of the table.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream Business Environment ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in 10th place, ahead of Uzbekistan. Medium-term scope exists for Turkmenistan to challenge Hungary above it. Industry Rewards: On the basis of downstream data alone, Turkmenistan ranks equal sixth with Romania among the regions 15 countries. This is attributable to the countrys ninth highest refining capacity, second highest gas demand growth outlook and joint third highest oil demand growth ranking. Country Rewards: Turkmenistan ranks eighth in terms of the Rewards section, although its country rewards rating holds last place in the region, behind even Uzbekistan and Slovenia. Growth in GDP per capita is the fifth highest for the entire region. Population ranks 11th and nominal GDP is the lowest in the region. Industry Risks: In the Risks section of our ratings, Turkmenistan is ranked 12th, just behind Uzbekistan. Its equal 11th place with Uzbekistan for industry risks reflects the challenging regulatory regime and the fact that there is little chance of near-term privatisation of government-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is ranked equal second, alongside Azerbaijan. The scores for short-term economic external risk, legal framework and physical infrastructure let the country down, but it benefits from one of the regions higher scores for short-term policy continuity. Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Risk Summary Political Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov announced in early July the formation of new private newspapers, signalling a potential departure from the state's control over media. This follows a statement back in May that the president would allow for the establishment of opposition parties, potentially indicating that some degree of political liberalisation could be in the offing in the near future. However, despite these recent statements, we expect the president to maintain his grip on power for the foreseeable future and for the regime to continue dominating the legislative and executive branches of government, with media freedom likely to remain under strict supervision as a result. Turkmenistan and Afghanistan have reaffirmed their desire to construct a new gas pipeline from Central Asia to India and Pakistan . Representatives from Ashgabat and Kabul, having signed a new agreement recently, have stated their interest in hammering out details surrounding the pipeline project by some point in October. While the potential for a new gas export pipeline is supportive of Turkmenistan's long-run energy-led growth strategy, we stress that the ongoing war in Afghanistan presents major impediments to the pipeline's construction. Turkmenistan has stated its intention to draw in prospective foreign investment companies to help construct a power link network between Turkmenistan and Pakistan, via Afghanistan. The project would include the construction of new transit power lines as well as renovation of a power station. While the government has not yet outlined an exact timeline for completion of the project, the plans are in line with Turkmenistan's strategy to diversify its energy export routes. To meet the energy demands of this project, Turkmenistan will reportedly convert gas reserves into electricity. Economic Business Environment Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Industry Forecast Scenario Oil And Gas Reserves Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Statistical Review, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. We are assuming no dramatic change in reserves even as production rises, with at least 570mn bbl remaining by 2014. Turkmenistan has proven gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm . All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. We are forecasting an increase in gas reserves to at least 8,500bcm during the forecast period. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Germany's RWE Dea has announced that it will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities in Turkmenistan's Block 23 between 2010 and 2014. Block 23 is an offshore gas block in the Turkmen sector of the Caspian Sea. During the initial four-year exploration period, the company will carry out an environmental study, followed by a 3D seismic survey. After completing the processing and interpretation of the seismic data acquired, the company will drill one obligatory exploration well. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, but rebounded to 206,000b/d in 2009. The government is targeting higherproduction, but the oil sector is strugglingto meet its growth goals owing to ashifting interest to gas production andlagging foreign investment. According toreports in 2007, Turkmenistan aims toproduce 2mn b/d by 2030, which seemsrather optimistic. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand is an estimated 120,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI is assuming 2010 oil production of 220,000b/d, rising to 350,000b/d by 2014 and peaking in around 2015 at 375,000b/d. Demand is forecast to increase from 120,000b/d to 150,000b/d by 2014, leaving export potential of up to 200,000b/d. Turkmenistan Oil Production, Consumption And Exports f = forecast. Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecasts BMI Gas Supply And Demand Consultant GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum productive capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. While GCA has not commented on how quickly the field could be brought onstream, the suggested output levels would significantly add to the countrys production volumes.

These include CNPC, LG International and Petrofac International. The contracts will include drilling and building gas processing plants in the Yolotan region. Turkmengaz had planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm per annum by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in October 2009. The source said that the output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. BMI believes that actual 2010 volumes will fall well short of the targeted capacity. Iran is hoping to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by end-2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency on April 23. Gazprom has contracted to transit only 10bcm of gas from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan in 2010, according to an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas. Under the terms of an agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat in December 2009, 30bcm were expected to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 65bcm in 2010 to 90bcm by 2014, with growth continuing beyond this point as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 21bcm to 28bcm during the period, so exports could reach 62bcm by 2014. Turkmenistan has two refineries, one at Chardzou and the other at Turkmenbashi, with a combined capacity of 237,000b/d. However, Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. Current BMI oil price assumptions are for an OPEC basket of US$83/bbl in 2010, followed by US$85/bbl in 2011, and an average of US$90/bbl in 2012-2014. The picture for oil export revenues is therefore relatively bright. Turkmenistan should earn an estimated US$2bn in 2010, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$6bn by 2014. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2014 are US$21bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2014 total could be US$28bn, against an estimated US$17bn in 2010.

Source: Historical data, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010. Forecasts, BMI The revenue picture painted above owes much to rising output and relatively high oil prices. There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise with the higher export volumes. At a flat US$50/bbl oil price from now until 2014, petroleum export revenues would rise to US$15bn. However, at a flat US$100/bbl, the export 2014 export revenues would be US$31bn. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Between 2010 and 2019, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 57%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 346,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2019 is set to increase by 55%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 192,000b/d by 2019. Gas production Key Risks To BMIs Forecast Scenario Long-Term Oil And Gas Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 125bcm by 2019, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 84bcm. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Oil And Gas Infrastructure Oil Refineries Turkmenistan has two refineries with a total capacity of 237,000b/d. One is at Chardzou, near the border with Uzbekistan, and has 120,493b/d capacity, while the other is at Turkmenbashi, with a crude processing capacity of 116,477b/d. Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised, however, and throughput represents only about half of nameplate capacity. Oil and oil products are exported from Turkmenistan by sea from the Kenar, Aladzha and Ekerem terminals. The throughput capacity of Kenar is 22mn bbl per year. The facility can accommodate tankers with a deadweight of up to 5,000 tonnes. The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year. The facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 deadweight tonnes. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. The Aladzha terminal has a throughput capacity of up to 17mn bbl of oil per year. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Interconnector Pipeline May 2010, saw the launch of construction of the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For Oil Storage Facilities The countrys main oil storage depot at Zerger was expanded in 2006 from a capacity of 124,666 bbl to its current capacity of 161,332 bbl. Oil Terminals/Ports Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum and construction is scheduled for completion in 2015. The pipeline will play a critical role in gas exports, allowing gas to be transported to different export destinations according to market conditions and preferences. It is seen as vital part of plans for eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline, was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009 by Turkmenistan's president Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and his Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline. The second leg of the pipeline will run from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase is currently being built, with construction expected to be completed by year-end, brining the capacity to around 16bcm. He added that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Turkmenistan-China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline is expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. A second parallel pipeline is expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the Turkmenistan-Iran Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Central Asia-Center Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the Central Asia-Center pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India During his visit to Turkmenistan in November 2009, Eni's CEO Paolo Scaroni offered assistance to the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. The proposed TAPI pipeline would supply 32bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Officials from the governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a deal in Islamabad on April 24 2008 to buy gas from Turkmenistan. The mountainous terrain that the route would have to cross presents significant technical challenges, however, and the US-led war in Afghanistan means that the pipeline is a distant prospect. The four countries behind the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in September 2010 signed two preliminary deals confirming their support for the project. Although the security and political problems that have plagued the project have not yet been resolved, the signing of the deal is a clear statement of intent by the four partners. According to a Reuters report, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat on September 20. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan will receive 5Mcm/d from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 14Mcm/d afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline will include a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 In May 2010, the governments of Turkmenistan and India reiterated their commitment to increased gas exports from Turkmenistan to India. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Macroeconomic Outlook Westward Energy Export Routes Doubtful BMI View: Significant risks surrounding the Nabucco pipeline could see Turkmenistan's hopes to diversify energy export routes westwards fail to materialise. Should the project fail to gain traction over the medium term, Turkmenistan will likely refocus its strategy on burgeoning energy markets in the east, most notably China and India, particularly given that the energy sector will be crucial to the country's long-run growth potential. Turkmenistan's strategy of diversifying its export routes remains in full swing, with the construction of a new East-West pipeline worth US$2bn having begun. Once complete, the pipeline will bring the country's largest known source of untapped gas reserves on the border with Afghanistan a step closer to the European market. However, while this domestic pipeline has provided a significant boost to the EU-proposed Nabucco pipeline project, for which construction is set to begin in 2011, we stress that major risks to the feasibility of the project remain and could yet scupper Turkmenistan's hopes of further diversifying its energy export routes. Regarding the potential for future energy trade between the EU and Turkmenistan, the Nabucco pipeline has been driven by both demand and supply-side factors. Indeed, as part of the Southern Energy Corridor Project, Nabucco would allow European markets to tap new gas sources from the Caspian region, while concomitantly reducing their dependence on Russian gas routes. Meanwhile, the project would support Turkmenistan's long-run strategy is to increasingly diversify its energy export routes. Having been dependent on Russian demand up until the beginning of the global economic crisis, Turkmenistan has since built new pipelines to China and Iran, but Western Europe remains an untapped market. Furthermore, securing new export routes and higher production volumes would ultimately help to support Turkmenistan's long-term growth potential. Rival Pipelines Looking More Likely That said, the major concern at this stage is that Nabucco will not be able to secure sufficient gas volumes to make it viable. As well as its main chosen source, Azerbaijans Shah Deniz II project, the pipeline will likely require sizeable gas supplies from Turkmenistan, and with other regional pipelines already competing for Azerbaijan's supply, additional gas sources may need to be sought. At the same time, the feasibility of transporting gas from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan via the Caspian remains a contentious issue, particularly given opposition from Russia and the unresolved status of the Caspian Sea, which creates disagreements over marine borders. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 47 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Finally, not all European countries support the Nabucco pipeline to the same extent. Indeed, the Russian-led Nord Stream and South Stream projects remain the more workable pipeline projects at this time, particularly given Germany's support for the former and support from a host of South-Eastern European countries for the latter, not to mention Russia's strong political resolve to see through with these projects. While many European countries support the construction of both Nabucco as well as Russia's proposed pipelines, it will take a great deal of political will on the part of the EU to see Nabucco successfully reach construction stage, which does not appear to be forthcoming at this juncture. Turkmenistan Will Not Hang Around Forever We stress that with Turkmenistan quickly ramping up production and focused on rapidly securing new sources of growth, the country may lose interest should further delays present themselves. Indeed, the EUs Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger recently stated that it could take until 2018 before the pipeline becomes operational, given ongoing discussions over infrastructure and transit feasibility. Indeed, as we have previously stated, having already built new pipelines to China and Iran, these markets present more secure export destinations for Turkmenistan for now. As such, there is a strong possibility that Turkmenistan may refocus its attention on Eastern markets, including construction of pipelines to Pakistan and India, should Nabucco fail to gain traction over the coming months.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Competitive Landscape Executive Summary The main government vehicle is state-owned Turkmenneft. IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. Petronas began producing from the Diyarbakir field in 2006. Petronas production increased from 4,700b/d of oil in the financial year ending March 31 2008 to 6,400b/d in FY08-09. In February 2008, Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2009, Eni produced an average of 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2008. The largest minority investor in oil explorer Dragon Oil has rejected a takeover bid from controlling shareholder ENOC that valued Dragon at US$3bn. Baillie Gifford & Co said in a statement emailed in November 2009 that the offer materially understates the fundamental and strategic value of Turkmenistan-focused Dragon. In 2008, Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea. Dragons average production rate for 2009 was 44,765b/d, up 9% from 2008 and 40% from 2007. Germanys RWE Dea in July 2009 announced that it signed a PSA to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. RWE will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities at the block between 2010 and 2014. The State Information Agency of Turkmenistan announced the start of production at the Yylakly field in the Central Karakum desert in early July 2009. First oil from the field, which was developed by subsidiaries of Turkmenneft, was transported to an oil facility around 65km south of the field, which was inaugurated on the same day. From there, the oil was sent by rail to the system of pipelines connected to the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries. Production is expected to reach a peak of 1,095b/d. The development of the Mydar field, also in the Central Karakum desert, is expected to start soon, with daily output expected to reach up to 2,555b/d of oil. State-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary reported in August 2008 that the South Gutlyayak field is producing some 200,000cm/d of gas and condensate, equal to 73Mcm per annum.

Source: BMI Overview/State Role Licensing And Regulation In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been production sharing agreements . The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energy, now owned by Italys Eni, produced an average of 12,000b/d in 2009. Petronas of Malaysia in 2006 began producing from the Diyarbakir field, with average production of 6,400b/d in FY08-09. Output from the offshore Cheleken block operated by Dragon Oil and Turkmenneft averaged 44,765b/d in 2008. Year Company 2009 Sales % share of total sales No. of employees Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Government Policy President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn in hydrocarbons sector investment by 2010, but this unlikely. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI at US$753mn. At least US$5bn per year over the next decade will need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMX consultant Jennifer Coolige argued in the report that there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under President Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be opening up under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya Basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. International Energy Relations Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010, an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has been aggressively pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 In 2008 Russia paid US$140 per thousand cubic metres for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May. During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late 2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010 Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. The pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by President Berdymukhamedov to Tehran on February 14 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 took part in the inauguration of the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline is expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. A second parallel pipeline is expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for EU External Relations Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner. While it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with state-owned Turkmengaz in H110. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 54 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 India and Turkmenistan have agreed to step up energy cooperation after high-level discussions during Turkmen president Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's first visit to India. The two sides expressed interest in several projects to transport Turkmen gas to India, including the long-mooted TAPI pipeline. However, BMI sees the political, security and technical challenges to the project as overwhelming making a gas-swap deal with Iran a more likely option. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries.

Table: Key Upstream Players Company Oil production Market share Gas production Company Business Monitor International Ltd Page 55 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Company Monitor Eni Company Analysis Italian major Eni acquired a foothold in Turkmenistan through its takeover of UK-based Burren Energy in 2007. In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov.

In January 2008, Reuters reported that Eni had secured 77% of Burren in an agreed GBP1bn bid and Eni finalised the transaction on February 29. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In 2007, Burren expected to produce 1mn tonnes of crude, equal to about 22,643b/d, up from around 20,000b/d in 2006. In the first half of August 2007, Burren produced 23,400b/d, compared with an average 21,800b/d in H107. In its latest annual report, Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2008. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Latest Developments Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy in November 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. In April 2008, Turkmenistan refused to issue entry visas to Enis managers, illustrating the governments irritation that it was not consulted about Enis takeover of Burrens assets. However, operations are said Business Monitor International Ltd Page 57 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 to be continuing as normal as former Burren employees that are now working for Eni are allowed to continue to travel in and out of the country, according to an Eni spokesperson. In August 2007, Burren announced record results from a new appraisal well in an undeveloped part of the Burun field. The Burun well B063 discovered 60m of net pay in the south-west of the field. The well flowed at a test rate of 2,200b/d, the highest flow rate of any Burun well. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 58 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies currently active in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Substantial domestic oil producer Strong relationship with government Early entrance into and established position in market Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Lack of developed infrastructure Opportunities: Rise in regional oil and gas consumption Long-term export opportunities Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address Dragon Oil Plc, ENOC House II,Third Floor Right Wing Sheikh Rashid Road Dubai, UAE Tel: +971 4 305 3660 Fax: +971 4 335 6954 www.dragonoil.com Financial Statistics Revenues: US$623mn US$706mn US$597mn US$325mn Net profit: US$259mn US$369mn US$304mn US$187mn Operating Statistics Oil production: 44,765b/d 40,992b/d 32,000b/d 20,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 59 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Market Position The Emirates National Oil Company , itself owned by the government of Dubai, holds a 52% share in London- and Dublin-listed Dragon Oil. The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of 8-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early 2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rose to 32,000b/d in 2007, 40,038b/d in 2008 and a record of 44,765b/d in 2009. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, down US$100mn from the 2009-2011 period. The company plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including five appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% on average over the period. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Latest Developments In mid-May 2010, Dragon Oil issued details of contracts it had awarded to construct two rig platforms in its Cheleken contract area, in the Turkmen waters of the Caspian Sea. The company believes that the platforms, which will allow the drilling of up 16 new wells, will help the company achieve its production targets. The Dzhygalybeg A platform, to be built by Q112, will support a land rig and a jack-up rig and will allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Zhdanov field. The Dzheitune C platform, to be built by Q411, will support a jack-up rig and allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Lam Field. In April 2010, Dragon Oil announced that it had reached an agreement with a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company on a new short-term deal to replace a crude oil swap agreement that expired on 31 March 2010. The swap deal signed with NIOC subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company involves Dragon exporting its Turkmen crude to the Iranian Caspian port of Bandar Neka, where it is then marketed locally. In exchange, NIOC allocates Iranian crude oil to Dragon at the Kharg Island terminal, located in the Persian Gulf. Dragon Oil increased its 2009 full-year production by 9% to 44,765b/d of oil. The company put eight development wells into production in 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 60 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 ENOCs takeover of Dragon Oil has come up against an obstacle, with Dragon's largest minority shareholder rejecting the GBP4/share offer. Baillie Gifford & Co issued a statement on November 11 2009 claiming that the offer materially understates the fundamental and strategic value of Dragon Oil. Baillie Giffords clients holdings under its management amount to around 4% of the currently issued stock of Dragon, which is already 52% owned by ENOC. In August 2009, Dragon Oil released production test results from its Dzheitune 13/135 development well. The well was drilled to a depth of 3,302m and produced an initial flow rate of 1,320b/d of oil, which was slightly below Dragons expectations. The company said flows would improve, however, as the pressures in the gas-bearing zones are normalised. Dragon Oil has now moved Rig 40 to Slot 5 on the Dzheitune 13 platform where it is drilling the Dzheitune 13/138 development well. Dragon Oil confirmed in June 2009 that it has received a preliminary takeover offer from an unnamed party, according to Reuters. The news agency reported that sources familiar with the situation believe that ENOC is the bidder. No details about the bid approach have been released. In June 2009, Dragon announced that it has successfully completed drilling the Dzheitune 28/134 development well, which was drilled to a total depth of 3,280m, using the Iran Khazar jackup rig. This well produced initial flow test rates of 2,685b/d and 869b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. In May 2009, Dragon Oil announced that it had completed testing its Dzheitune 13/133A development well, which is also located in Turkmenistans sector of the Caspian Sea. According to a company statement, the well produced flow test rates of 1,488b/d and 1,140b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. In early 2009, Dragon announced that it exceeded its 2008 production target producing an average of 40,992b/d. In July 2008, Dragon released a drilling update on its activities in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. The Dzheitune-22/128 development well was drilled to a depth of 3,848m and produced combined test flows of 2,600b/d of oil, according to a statement released to the Regulatory News Service. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 61 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Petronas Summary Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has told the Turkmen government that it could be producing up to 5bcm of gas from Block 1, with production expected to be increased to 10bcm at a later stage. Currently only oil is produced from the field. President Berdymukhamedov met Petronas former president, Hassan Marican, on May 15 2009 to discuss the companys Turkmenistan activities, according to Reuters. Petronas estimates that the field has 150bcm of reserves. In June 2009 Petronas said it would start installation work at Block 1 in early 2010. The facilities at the block will include a drilling platform, a wellhead platform and offshore pipelines. Offshore contractor Sigur Ros has signed a letter of intent to supply the crew and equipment required for the pipe laying work. First gas from the first phase of the block was scheduled for Q310 but appears to have been delayed. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. CNPC has reported what appears to be a major gas discovery in September 2010. CNPC reported that exploration well Oja-21 in Block B maintained a flow of 1mn Mcm/d of gas and 36cm/d of condensate during testing. The company has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bn bcm of reserves. PetroChina said in early September 2009 that it would pay US$1bn to its parent company CNPC for its share of the Amu Darya Right Bank gas field in Turkmenistan. The field, which is scheduled to come China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 onstream by the end of 2009, is earmarked to supply the second West-East gas pipeline that will transport gas to Shanghai. Gazprom Summary Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. In April 2003, the Russian and Turkmen presidents signed a bilateral cooperation agreement covering natural gas, which will remain in force from January 1 2004 until December 31 2028. Within the deal, state-controlled Turkmenneftegaz agreed a contract for the supply of Turkmen natural gas over the same period. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 in its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal on September 13 2009 with Turkmenistan to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which have been tense since April following an explosion on Itera Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 63 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite its dispute with Gazprom. Discussions on the project had been ongoing since February 18. By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its former partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for 16 years and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman Igor Makarov, this is the first time the company has been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Preliminary estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas a year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April when RWEs CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistans President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which has been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3D seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. The company in April 2010 said it would invest US$60-80mn at the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil has returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010 in response to earlier media reports. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall RWE Summary Others Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 64 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Canadian-registered independent Buried Hill Energy claimed that it signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan, confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 65 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Oil And Gas Outlook: Long-Term Forecasts Regional Oil Demand A strengthening of the 2010-2014 oil demand trend is predicted for the 2014-2019 period, reflecting the economic weakness prevailing in the earlier period, as well as the under-developed nature of several key economies, ongoing wealth generation thanks to rising export volumes, plus the maturing of new EU member states. The regions oil consumption is expected to increase by 13% in 2014-2019, after 10% growth in the period 2010-2014. Over the extended 2010 to 2019 forecast period, Azerbaijan leads the way, with oil demand increasing by an estimated 83%, followed by Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (+55%) and Kazakhstans 32% growth. Hungary lags the field, as a result of greater market maturity and the lack of hydrocarbons income that stimulates economies elsewhere in the region.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 66 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Regional Oil Supply A 5% rise in CEE oil production during the 2014-2019 period matches the 5% expansion seen in 2010-2014, and reflects a likely plateau in Russian, Kazakh and Azeri output, with no other major country expected to have substantial longer-term upside potential. Kazakhstan is by far the biggest contributor to growth, with output forecast to rise by 39% between 2010 and 2019. Turkmenistan exceeds it in percentage terms (+57%), but is a much smaller absolute contributor. Russia has the weakest production trend among the major producers, with a likely 6% gain between 2010 and 2019.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 67 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Regional Refining Capacity CEE is set for a 22% increase in crude distillation capacity between 2010 and 2019, contributing to the expansion of the worlds over-stretched refining industry. Cheap and plentiful local crude supplies help make it a region of choice for refinery investment, although government control of the downstream industry will need to be eased.

Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 125bcm by 2019, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 84bcm. Methodology And Risks To Forecasts In terms of oil and gas supply, as well as refining capacity, the projections are wherever possible based on known development projects, committed investment plans or stated government/company intentions. A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historical reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

Our approach has been threefold. First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all 16 industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline Oil & Gas BER is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of Upstream/Downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients, who will have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite for their operations. Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% Upstream BER and 50% Downstream BER: Upstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Upstream rating which is composed of limits/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Downstream rating which comprises limits/risks . Both the Upstream BER and Downstream BER are composed of Limits/Risks sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader Country Risk components: Limits of Potential Returns: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Ratings Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 73 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Risks to Realisation of those Returns: Evaluates both Industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Rule of Law Legal Framework Physical Infrastructure Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 77 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts BMI's industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 78 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q4 2010 Energy Industry There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy Supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: national energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; international quotas, guidelines and projections, such as OPEC, IEA, US Energy Information Administration . Energy Consumption A mixture of methods is used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historical relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts, based on company- or state-specific investment levels Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third-party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Cross Checks Sources Sources include those international bodies mentioned above, such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news agencies.

1d507dbe-8f6a-4ddb-bf37-44e51cc5bbd3,"European View 10:201206 DOI 10/s12290-011-0181-3 ARTICLE Published online: 17 November 2011 Centre for European Studies 2011 Abstract When Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced his intention to return to the Kremlin for a third presidential term, he marked a significant milestone in the countrys political development. More than just another assumed victory for Putins party of power, his putative return to the presidency is without precedent in post-Communist Russia and signals a clear venture into uncharted territory. Even if Putins triumph at the ballot box is all but certain, it is far from clear whether his next administration will be able to address the mounting pressures that weigh heavily on the Russian state. From the countrys spiralling demographic crisis to its over-reliance on mineral exports and long-delayed reforms to the judiciary and political institutions, the risk of long-term stagnation and state decline is greater today than when Putin first took office more than 10 years ago. Indeed, the choices made during Putins next term could have far-reaching consequences, not just for Russias relationship with the US and the EU, but for his countrys aspirations to reassert itself as a global power. Keywords Russia European Union Eurasian Union NATO Regional power Demographic challenges The risk of decline Among all of the obstacles that policymakers will face during Putins next presidential term, the reality of Russias demographic collapse is perhaps the P. Doran Center for European Policy Analysis, 1225 19th Street NW, Suite 450, Washington, DC 20036, USARussias restive future Peter B. Since 1992, Russias overall population has been declining in a slow, unnerving spiral. Rooted in the premature death of its citizens rather than low birth rates, the current trend of Russian depopulation has now lasted longer than at any other period in the countrys modern history. Worse still, this process shows no signs of abating. According to the most recent projections by the United Nations Development Program , by 2030 Russia will be home to roughly 130 million people; by 2040 that number will have fallen to little more than 120 million . By comparison, in 2040, neighbouring Turkey will boast roughly the same population as Russia. As the consequences of this unsettling decline grow more acute over the next decade, Russian defence and economic planners will have to contend with a host of new problems. In the security realm, Russias armed forces will have an increasingly smaller pool of available manpower with which to ensure the territorial integrity of one-eighth of the earths inhabited land surface. This will be no small feat, since Russias eastern and southern frontiers are likely to be flanked by the ambitious rise of strategic competitors, such as China, and an arc of potential instability stretching from Afghanistan to the South Caucasus . In the economic sphere, the outlook is equally troublingthere are no historical examples of a society that has undergone this level of population collapse while simultaneously maintaining strong economic growth. Yet, it is precisely the promise of affluence and national strength that United Russia has pledged to provide to its citizens. Clearly, one source of traditional strength for the Russian economy has been the natural resources sector, particularly the hard currency generated through energy and mineral exports. However, the draw-down in Russian GDP growth during the recent global economic crisis demonstrated that the countrys dependence on these exports has amplified its vulnerability to unexpected price shocks and the capricious appetite of global markets. Worse still, Russias vast energy wealth is not without its limits. In fact, the failure of state-owned companies like Gazprom to invest in new extraction technologies and up-stream capacity could ultimately compromise Russias ability to fulfil its long-term gas delivery contracts with downstream customers in Europe . Inside Russian policymaking circles, the baseline risk of export dependence and declining extraction capacity is frequently acknowledged. In fact, during his acceptance speech at the United Russia party conference in September 2011, President Dmitry Medvedev placed economic modernisation at the top of his priority list. However, economic diversification and sustainable GDP growththe ultimate benefits of modernisationhave been on the agenda for over a decade, with limited signs of success. As the recent dismissal of long-standing Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Kudrin indicated, it is one thing to promise modernisation and entirely another to deliver it. One outcome of Kudrins discordant departure from power was the opening of a rare window onto the decision-making councils of Putins Russia. By denouncing the governments preference for top-down strategies that bloat the state budget and hinder sustainable economic growth, Kudrin accused outgoing President Medvedev of being enamoured with unnecessary budgetary outlays. Medvedev responded by indignantly asserting that such expenditures are essential, since Russia is not a European View 203 banana republic. This may be so, but the unintended consequences of the Kremlins current approach to governance are more likely to aggravate, rather than alleviate, the overall conditions of long-term decline in Russia. Restive Russia Given these unwanted pressures, the potential for a restive Russian decline, as opposed to a modernising recovery, is significant. In addressing the dilemma this poses, Western governments will need to answer a number of critical policy questions, including: What is the likely future of the USRussia reset? What can be expected from Russias evolving relationships with its neighbours? and How might these relationships impact the security perceptions of US allies in Central Europe? The future of the reset is perhaps the most immediate question to arise out of Putins announcement that he will assume a third term as Russias president. During the initial phase of his own presidency, Barack Obama invested considerable political capital in cultivating an effective working relationship with Medvedev. This included the secret letter offering to reset relations with Moscow, the Start II Treaty, cross-border transit rights for supply shipments to Afghanistan and even working lunches between the two heads of state at popular burger restaurants in Washington. In President Obamas view, Putin was a man with one foot in the old ways of doing business, while Medvedev was ostensibly a leader with both feet in the present . The old way of doing business is one that views the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century, as Putin once infamously stated. But what is old is new again, and will likely have a direct bearing on future efforts to squeeze additional foreign policy and security deliverables out of the reset. When it comes to Russias foreign policy priorities, it is no coincidence that Putins announced return to the Kremlin coincided with his bold new initiative to reassert Moscows prominence in Europe and Eurasia. One week after the United Russia party conference, the president-in-waiting set out his vision for transforming Russias emerging Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan into an ambitious Eurasian Union alongside Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Modelled on the EU, this reordering of the Eurasian geopolitical space would include shared governing institutions, joint economic policies and passport-free travel. Economically linked but politically polycentric, Putins strategy would place Russia at a nexus between Europe and a dynamic Asia. In line with Russias enduring effort to assert its status as primus inter pares in the post-Soviet space, Putins plan would ultimately make Russia the strongest and only fully sovereign actor in the Union project This Eurasian blueprint can be seen as an effort to 1 See also . 123 counter the downward pressures of the demographic crisis. However, in fully addressing these challenges, Russian interests would be better served by cultivating an alignment of nimble, politically vibrant mid- and small-sized alliesnot a ring fence of dependent clients. Viewed holistically, Putins plan to forge a Eurasian Union will advance efforts in Moscow to solidify a hardened sphere of Russian interests in the near abroad. If the current trend continues unabated, this strategy could ultimately aggravate latent security concerns among US allies in Moscows ambient zone of influence. Since the onset of Washingtons reset, and the similar atmosphere of rapprochement in Warsaw, these anxieties have generally lain dormant across Central Europe. Yet they have not disappeared. In fact, Russias desire to expand its control of strategic economic assets in Belarus, and persistent questions over the eastward bias of Ukraines multi-vector foreign policy, only increase the potential for heightened threat perceptions in the region. If left unchecked, elevated security concerns along the EUs eastern border could reintroduce calls for overtand costlydemonstrations of NATOs commitment to the collective defence of its members. Resetting expectations Going forward, the announcement of Vladimir Putins third presidential term provides an ideal opportunity for the US and Europe to evaluate the current state of transatlantic engagement with Moscow. This is not to say that the recent improvement in USRussia relations should be discarded. However, expectations for additional, substantive deliverables from the reset should be realistic. Thus far, the most significant deliverable to be produced by the reset has been the Start II Treaty. Yet this agreement represented relatively low-hanging fruit for both sides. The ceiling on long-range strategic weapons is generous, while the chances of an intercontinental nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia are infinitesimal. Meanwhile, other, more relevant security questions could prove harder to resolve. This includes Moscows likely efforts to impose limits on the development of US missile defence technology and the future of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. In this regard, Russias population decline will play a significant role. As the Kremlin contends with a shrinking pool of conventional forces, it will have a powerful incentive to brace itself against the bulwark of its nuclear deterrent. If policymakers in Washington hope to use the reset as a mechanism for additional breakthroughs in nuclear non-proliferation, they are likely to be disappointed. Eurasian Union At the same time, the Kremlin risks its own disappointment if it hopes to fundamentally re-order the Eurasian geopolitical space through an eastern counterpart to the EU. As seen from Europes efforts to form a more perfect union, ambitious multi-state projects are most successful when they enjoy a European View 205 shared, self-sustaining rationale and a willingness among members to make sacrifices for the benefit of all. Thus far, the underlying logic of Putins Eurasian Union is neither self-sustaining nor would its full implementation benefit all countries equally. Visa travel might be an appealing offer for prospective members. But short of coercion, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have no compelling reason to uniformly submerge key aspects of their sovereignty into yet another Russian-dominated union. Even so, the allure of Russian sovereign democracy and other soft-power mechanisms could still have a net negative impact on democratic principles and best practices in governance across the whole of the post-Soviet space. As such, US and EU pro-democracy programmes are one of the best Western response strategies to Russias ambitious Eurasian agendaIn countries where robust free-market competition and transparent, democratic governance are dominant, Russias ability to exert its special status is greatly diminished. The opposite is true, however, in places where these principles are not firmly embedded in the political culture. By exporting transatlantic norms to the East and helping to develop institutions of democratic governance far beyond the EUs formal borders, the West can counter the corrosive influence of non-transparency and top-down rule. Fault line allies Despite the headwinds facing the Eurasian Union, the potential for elevated Russian pressure along the NATORussian fault line coincides with the prospect of heightened austerity in US and European defence budgets. In this environment, Western defence planners should be prepared for a surge in revisionist rhetoric and behaviour from Moscow. Only two short years have passed since the destabilising RussiaGeorgia war, and the risk of future low-intensity conflicts in the post-Soviet space should not be ignored. As transatlantic security structures grapple with the practical implications of expected cuts, Washington will need to engage with NATOs easternmost members in order to forestall the perception of American retrenchment and retreat . When articulating his vision for a reordered European and Eurasian geopolitical space, Putin gives little currency to the transatlantic links that have bolstered US and EU policy for decades. If Putin truly intends to use his next presidential term to establish Russia as the spokesperson for a new Eurasian bloc, policymakers in the West should actively seek to frame their engagement with Moscow within the context of transatlantic values and collective security. In the event that Russian forces are again involved in a high-profile cross-border operation, the United States and NATO would do well to anticipate a re-examination of their long-standing security arrangements with Central European allies. In the near term, Washington should seek to cultivate its transatlantic security links with the region through existing formats such as the USPolish strategic dialogue, increased visits by senior US government officials 2 This is especially relevant in the case of the EUs Eastern Partnership Initiative. 123 and widened the channels of day-to-day bilateral communication. Should exposed Central European states once again question the sincerity of Americas security guarantees , the answer from Washington should be immediate and precise: the United States stands by its commitments. Ultimately, Russia can, and should, play a constructive and beneficial role in the economic and security affairs of its neighbours. Yet such a positive influence is less likely if Russian policymakers are unable to resolve the burdens of the demographic collapse, their overdependence on mineral exports and the need for systemic political reform. If the current approach, one which leans heavily on one-party rule and special project directives, proves to be unsuccessful, then Russias aspirations for prominence on the global stage are likely to be trapped in the thicket of a restive decline. This outcome would be just as bad for Russia as it would be for the US and Europe. And it is for this reason that the choices made during Putins third term will reverberate throughout the next decade."

71 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Executive Summary After two disastrous years in terms of gas exports, the latest Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report from BMI forecasts that the country will bounce back in 2011 with exports recovering slightly to approach the levels seen prior to the fateful CAC-4 pipeline explosion in April 2009. The disproportionately significant consequences of this event continue to reverberate around the Turkmen gas industry, with the country exporting less gas over the course of 2009 and 2010 than it did in the whole of 2008. New pipeline projects to China have so far failed to deliver the volumes Turkmenistan had used to export to Russia. We expect gas exports to 57bcm by 2015, on the back of 90bcm of production and demand of 32bcm. Oil production has never been Turkmenistans strong suit but we nevertheless see scope for strong growth from a low base. Turkmen oil production rose to 200,000b/d in 2010 and we expect it to rise further to 305,000b/d by 2015. Net exports will continue to grow due to the lower base for growth in oil consumption, which will rise from 119,000b/d in 2010 to 186,000b/d in 2015. This should mean Turkmenistan is exporting 153,000b/d by 2015, up from 81,000b.d in 2010. In the long term Turkmenistans gas industry holds immense unlocked potential and could rise by 56% to as much as 140bcm by 2020, making it one of the worlds top gas producers. Although grossly inefficient use of gas should ensure the country also becomes a major consumer by 2020, using 46bcm. This should allow Turkmenistan to export as much as 94bcm of gas, provided that sufficient demand exists and suitable export infrastructure is put in place to utilise the countrys potential. Turkmenistans oil production growth should continue well into the second half of the decade by which time the country should be producing 353,000b/d. By 2020, demand of 193,000b/d should mean the country will be able to export 160,000b/d, mainly to its Central Asian neighbours. Although Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the early-2000s but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Global GDP growth in 2011 is forecast at 3%, down from 4% in 2010. Growth in the eurozone should be marginally higher than 2010, while US and Chinese economic expansion will slow and Japans growth will be negative, reflecting the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Our oil price assumption for 2011 is US$101/bbl for the OPEC basket, falling to US$97/bbl in 2012. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Turkmenistan shares first place with Poland in BMIs composite Business Environment ratings table, which combines upstream and downstream scores. It occupies seventh place in BMIs updated upstream ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Turkmenistan is second in BMIs downstream ratings, with a few particularly high. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, as does refining capacity expansion. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Political SWOT Strengths Common strategic interests will smooth regional relations with Turkmenistan's energy-hungry neighbours such as China, and possibly even the EU. Weaknesses Despite growing discontent over increased repression and corruption, there is little prospect of an organised opposition gaining a foothold. Harsh methods will be used to suppress public protest, and multimillion-dollar contracts signed with Western companies will mute business support. Opportunities The stable transition of power after Saparmurat Niyazov's death is a positive sign of political stability. President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedovs policies indicate that he may be willing to forge greater trade and business links with foreign countries. Threats Turkmenistan will remain one of the world's most restrictive societies, and with few of the benefits from increased hydrocarbon sales reaching the population, there remains some risk of civil uprising. Turkmenistan Economic SWOT Strengths Economic activity will be supported by the ongoing expansion of energy production and exports, ensuring strong growth in the medium term. Weaknesses The official economic figures remain unreliable, reflecting the legacy of the Soviet era when only 'positive data' were released. With fiscal management opaque, international financial institutions will continue to find it hard to analyse and support Turkmenistan's economic development. The persistence of central planning, with government use of production targets and mandatory state procurement, will prevent efficient resource allocation, risking shortages of consumer goods, inflationary pressure and stunted growth. Opportunities The gas pipeline to China, the first section of which came onstream in December 2009, helps diversify the country's export markets. Moreover, the country is also considering diversifying its gas export routes to Europe, bypassing Russia. The trade surplus provides an opportunity for the government to diversify the economy. Threats Trade levels will continue to fluctuate greatly while gas markets remain vulnerable to interruptions in pipeline access and external shocks. Turkmenistan Business Environment SWOT Strengths Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 216,000b/d in 2010. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm, ranking it among the worlds top five countries. Weaknesses All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow have soured, following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan. Opportunities Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC- friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. The country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Threats Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Turkmenistan Energy Market Overview Once-isolationist Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners, but some have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. However, in March 2011, the countrys Energy Ministry, cited by Reuters, announced that it would not invite foreign oil companies to explore its onshore gas fields, although they would be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. Foreign companies exploration will therefore be limited to Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya Basin in the east, and the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian Basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. The revision puts reserve estimates above the high estimate made by UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates when it conducted the first independent assessment of the field in October 2008. GCA put the field's low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to its export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. We expect production volumes to have picked up only slightly to around 42bcm in 2010. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. However, Turkmenistan has been pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009/2010 it inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The inauguration of the China pipeline in December 2009 marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's northwestern Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger has said that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Speaking to a think-tank conference in Brussels in January 2011, Oettinger said that the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev was prepared to sell 18-21bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor. Azerbaijan could start gas exports to the EU in 2016-2019, according to the Knight Ridder news agency. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell another 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. The Southern Corridor project aims to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas imports by establishing a direct route to import gas from the Caspian region. The main component of the project is the Nabucco pipeline, which is aimed at transporting gas from Central Asia or the Middle East via Turkey into Europe. From Turkey, the corridor extends to include the planned Trans-Adriatic Pipeline project and the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline, as well as the proposed White Stream pipeline. Nabucco has stalled because of an inability to secure sufficient quantities of feedstock gas. Russia has signed an agreement with Afghanistan to help build the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. The proposed US$4bn TAPI pipeline would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to India, which joined the project in 2008. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan would receive 1bcm per year from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 5bcm per year afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energyis now owned by Italys Eni group. Turkmenistan is set to open development of its offshore Caspian oil deposits to US majors for the first time. Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov in August 2010 selected US majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips as well as US-based TX Oil and Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Oil and Gas to develop blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian Sea, according to Reuters quoting state television. Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . A third 50,000b/d refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Regional Energy Market Overview Although Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the early-2000s but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Russias gas deposits not only dominate regional supply but are also the biggest single source for Western Europe. While consumer countries wish to diversify away from Russia, there are no other regional suppliers of note. LNG is not a major trade for the CEE region, although Russia began exporting gas in March 2009 from the Far Eastern Sakhalin projects into the Asia Pacific markets, while Poland, Croatia, Romania and Lithuania are all looking into building LNG import terminals. Russian 2010 oil production performed strongly, rising for the second consecutive year following a dip in 2008 that ended a strong growth trend that began in 2000. Production now looks close to its eventual peak, although there is still potential for several more years of slow growth before output starts to decline. An increase to 10mn b/d is pencilled in for 2011, with further growth to 10mn b/d expected in 2012. The other regional theme is the Caspian states and their ability to meet production and export targets. The ultimate long-term potential is in little doubt, but a mixture of technical, commercial and political factors looks set hold back the rate of supply expansion. In 2009, the previously expected strong growth in output evaporated in the wake of persistent technical and commercial problems. Azerbaijan has some near-term upside. Kazakhstans near-term output growth potential is limited thanks to technical problems and the Kashagan field dispute, but longer-term prospects are good once Kashagan becomes a major contributor. CEE oil production averaged an estimated 13mn b/d in 2010. The region's output is expected to be 13mn b/d in 2011 and to reach 15mn b/d by 2015. In terms of demand, the estimated 2010 average of 6mn b/d is set to rise to 6mn b/d by 2015. This means that net exports from the region will climb steadily, from an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 to 8mn b/d by 2015.

Russia was by far the largest producer in 2010 with 76% of regional output, although this share will fall to 72% by 2015.An increasing share of production will come from Kazakhstan, rising from 12% to 15% by 2015, and Azerbaijan, which will grow from 8% to 9% of the total. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total rose to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 8mn b/d by 2015. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the most important exporter. 13,053 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Oil: Downstream Table: Central/Eastern Europe Oil Refining Capacity Country 2008 2009 2010 2011e 2012f 2013f 2014f 2015f Azerbaijan 440 440 440 440 440 440 440 440 Bulgaria 197 197 197 197 197 197 197 197 Croatia 146 146 146 146 146 146 146 146 Czech Republic 183 183 183 183 183 183 183 183 Hungary 213 213 213 213 213 213 213 213 Kazakhstan 345 345 390 390 390 390 390 390 Poland 422 422 422 422 422 422 422 422 Romania 383 383 383 383 383 383 383 364 Russia 5,428 5,428 5,347 5,417 5,442 5,467 5,567 5,667 Slovakia 121 121 121 121 131 141 151 161 Slovenia - - - - - - - - Turkey 613 613 613 613 613 713 813 813 Turkmenistan 288 288 287 287 287 287 347 347 Ukraine 851 851 851 851 750 750 750 650 Uzbekistan 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 Regional Total 9,855 9,855 9,817 9,887 9,821 9,956 10,226 10,217 e/f = estimate/forecast. Historical data: Energy Information Administration/BMI. Refining capacity for the region was 10mn b/d in 2001, falling sharply to an estimated 9mn b/d in 2010. Capacity expansion will lag that in most other emerging regions, largely due to falling Ukrainian capacity although Russia and Turkey plan a processing boost. The regions total capacity is forecast to reach 10mn b/d by 2015 well ahead of oil demand, therefore implying substantial net exports of refined products. Russia will remain the largest refiner by far, with its share of total capacity increasing slightly from 54% to 55%.

Land boundaries mean pipeline transportation of gas is the favoured option, particularly from Russia through the CEE region into Western Europe. However, Russia became an LNG exporter in 2009 as Gazprom/Shells Sakhalin-II project entered production. Also, Poland is planning medium- to long-term LNG imports as a means of diversifying supply away from Russia, while proposals are being discussed for a Croatian LNG terminal on the Adriatic coast, with imports possible by 2017. Longer term, all three Baltic states are discussing the construction of one or more LNG terminals, although this remains highly speculative. Romania is also considering its own LNG import facility eventually. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Business Environment Ratings Central/Eastern Europe Region The Central/Eastern Europe region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime. Oil production growth for the period to 2015 ranges from a negative 24% for Romania to a positive 52% in Turkmenistan, while oil demand growth ranges from 3% to 40% across the region. Gas output is forecast to fall by 21% in Romania, but to rise 114% in Turkmenistan. The range for forecast gas consumption growth is from 13% to 65%. The political and economic environment varies, depending partly on market maturity and EU membership. Russia and the Caspian states are viewed as more volatile and less stable than the recent EU entrants. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Composite Scores Composite Business Environment scores are calculated using the average of individual upstream and downstream ratings. Poland has now taken top spot from Kazakhstan, as a result of high shale gas potential and a growing willingness to open up its refining sector to foreign investment, combined with a generally benign regulatory environment. Increasing state interference in the energy sector and changes to the tax system have helped to push Kazakhstan down to third, below Turkey which has been buoyed by strong downstream prospects and growing interest in Black Sea exploration. Slovenia sits at the bottom of the rankings, with a composite upstream and downstream score of just 38 points out of the 100 available. The points spread in the CEE region is considerably narrower than elsewhere, with the lowest-ranked country having 62% of the score allocated to the highest-ranked. Russia now holds fourth place below Turkey and Kazakhstan, with a medium-term chance of catching those immediately above, but little hope of challenging Poland for now. Llittle separates the mid-placed countries Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Turkey is in a close fight with Poland for first position, while Romania and Ukraine are closely matched just above the middle of the league table, ahead of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria with their limited upstream resource potential.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Risk Summary Political President Berdymukhamedov has once again stated his openness to the formation of opposition parties, whilst speaking to parliament on January20 2011, echoing previous speeches in 2010. While the president has ostensibly embarked on a programme of economic and political liberalisation after taking over power four years ago, the country's political system remains authoritarian in nature, with Berdymukhamedov maintaining a close grip on the legislative and judicial branches of government. Ultimately, despite continued overtures to further political liberalisation, we do not expect the political environment to change considerably in the near future. According to a government official, Japan has agreed to help finance the construction of a US$1bn chemical plant in the ex-Soviet nation, which will help to produce much-needed fertilizers for the country's cotton crops. The majority of the funding from Japan will reportedly come from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the plant is expected to become operational by 2014. Despite its extensive development of domestic gas reserves over the past two years, Turkmenistan will remain a major cotton producer in the region for the foreseeable future, in our view. According to the Turkmen foreign ministry, Turkmenistan is reportedly set to begin construction on a new power line in the next two months to Afghanistan that will increase energy exports to the war-torn country by a factor of five. The project is not expected to be completed until late 2013 and will cost just less than US$400mn, but will also potentially also allow the export of electricity to be increased towards Pakistan and Tajikistan. Economic Business Environment Business Monitor International Ltd Page 25 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Industry Forecast Scenario Oil And Gas Reserves Turkmenistan claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. The EIA, on which BMIs forecasts are based, takes a more moderate view, assigning no more than 600mn bbl to the country in 2010. We are assuming no dramatic change in proven reserves even as production rises, with around 570mn bbl remaining by 2014/15. All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. We are forecasting an increase in gas reserves to at least 9,800bcm during the forecast period. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. State-run China National Petroleum Corporation has made a major gas discovery in Turkmenistan, according to a September 2010 Reuters report. CNPC has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bcm of reserves. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 26 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 85,000b/d in 1994 to 210,000b/d during 2004. Output then slipped to 176,000b/d in 2006, but rebounded to an estimated 200,000b/d in 2010. The government is targeting higherproduction, but the oil sector is strugglingto meet its growth goals owing to ashifting interest to gas production andlagging foreign investment. According toreports in 2007, Turkmenistan aimed toproduce 2mn b/d by 2030. Althoughthis target has been reduced to 1mn b/d by 2030, according to an unnamed source speaking to Reuters in March 2011, we still see the new output target as rather optimistic. BMI forecasts 2011 oil production averaging 206,000b/d, rising to 305,000b/d by 2015. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand is an estimated 125,000b/d in 2011 and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI forecasts demand to increase to 152,000b/d by 2015, leaving export potential of up to 153,000b/d.

Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecasts BMI Gas Supply And Demand Consultant GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum productive capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. While GCA has not commented on how quickly the field could be brought on stream, the suggested output levels would significantly add to the countrys production volumes. UK-based services firm Petrofac has begun work on the second phase of the South Yolotan scheme. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the US$3bn phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. It will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Remarks by a Turkmen energy official suggest that Petronas's Block-1 could have started exporting gas by early-2011, with an anonymous source claiming Russia could be the export destination.The head of Turkmenistan's State Agency on Management of Hydrocarbon Resources, Yagshigeldy Kakayev, said that production would reach 5bcm per year during the first phase of development, rising to 10bcm at an unspecified date. He said the gas would be exported, but did not say what the destination would be. Pricing disputes with Russia meant thatTurkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to its export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. We expect production volumes to have picked up only slightly to around 42bcm in 2010. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 42bcm in 2010 to 90bcm by 2014/15, with growth continuing beyond this point as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 22bcm to 32bcm during the period, so exports could reach 57bcm by 2015.

Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . Originally designed to process Russian crudes, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced the two plants to use local crudes as feedstock. A third refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. This 50,000b/d plant also processes local light sweet crudes sourced from Dragon Oil's Cheleken Contract Area in the Black Sea. In order to increase refining capacity, Turkmenistan is reportedly looking into expanding both of the state owned plants and adding three new refineries. According to an unnamed government official cited by Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Reuters in March 2011, Turkmenistan wants to increase capacity at both refineries to 9mn tpa each, equivalent to 180,000b/d each. He did not say when the expansion projects would take place. He claimed that the country also plans to build a third state-owned refinery in the Balkan Province near Dragon Oil's facility by 2025. A further two refineries are planned by 2030 in the eastern regions of Mary and Akhai. With a combined capacity of around 240,000b/d, these three greenfield refineries would likely be smaller than the two existing state-owned plants. The official did not specify whether the three new refineries would also be state owned. Nevertheless, he claimed that the government plans to launch international tenders for the plants, in a move that could create opportunities for oil and gas construction companies such as Technip, KBR, and WorleyParsons, all of which have worked on projects in Turkmenistan. In March 2011 an unnamed source, cited by Reuters, said that Turkmenistan planned to increase refining volumes to 400,000b/d by 2020, to 440,000b/d by 2025 and to 600,000b/d by 2030. In BMI's view these highly ambitious refining targets are unlikely to be achieved. Without any indications of any of these projects actually going ahead, we have not included the expansions in our current forecasts. Revenues/Import Costs The picture for oil export revenues is relatively bright. Turkmenistan should earn an estimated US$3bn from crude in 2011, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$5bn by 2015. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2015 are US$25bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2015 total could be US$30bn, against an estimated US$23bn in 2011.

There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise with the higher export volumes.

The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year and the facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 deadweight tonnes. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Interconnector Pipeline May 2010, saw the launch of construction of the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum and construction is scheduled for completion in 2015. The pipeline will play a critical role in gas exports, allowing gas to be transported to different export destinations according to market conditions and preferences. It is seen as vital part of plans for eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. While gas exports to Europe are a possibility, pre-requisites include the resolution of Caspian Sea maritime border disputes and the construction of a subsea pipeline, neither of which BMI sees as likely in the short term. Given CNPC's investment in South Yolotan, eastward gas exports to China are set to rise in the coming years. Turkmenistan-Iran Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline, was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009. Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010 the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline. The second leg of the pipeline runs from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase was completed at the end of 2010, bringing the capacity to around 16bcm. He said that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Central Asian Gas Pipeline The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Central Asia-Center Until recently, Soviet-era Central Asia-Center line to Russia was Turkmenistans sole export trunkline. Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on CAC in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India During his visit to Turkmenistan in November 2009, Eni's CEO Paolo Scaroni offered assistance to the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. The proposed TAPI pipeline would supply 32bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Officials from the governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a deal in Islamabad on April 24 2008 to buy gas from Turkmenistan. The mountainous terrain that the route would have to cross presents significant technical challenges, however, and the US-led war in Afghanistan means that the pipeline is a distant prospect. The four countries behind the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in September 2010 signed two preliminary deals confirming their support for the project. Although the security and political problems that have plagued the project have not yet been resolved, the signing of the deal is a clear statement of intent by the four partners. According to a Reuters report, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat on September 20. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan will receive 5Mcm/d from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 14Mcm/d afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline will include a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Turkmenistan, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed another deal for the pipeline in December 2010. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Russia signed an agreement in January 2011 with Afghanistan to help build the proposed TAPI gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. Although Russian involvement could boost the project's chances of going ahead, it undermines TAPI's aim of diversifying Central Asia's gas export routes away from Russia. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early-December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Macroeconomic Outlook Stellar Growth To ContinueBMI View: 2011 is set to mark another year of stellar growth following 9% economic expansion in 2010. We hold to our forecast for 9% growth this year, driven by a burgeoning energy sector and ongoing diversification of export destinations. While foreign direct investment will remain focused on the oil and gas sector for the foreseeable future, the government will continue to channel energy export revenues to develop other sectors of the economy. Turkmenistan notched up an impressive growth rate of 9% in 2010 according to the State Committee of Turkmenistan, slightly above our expectation of 8%, and up from 6% in 2009. We expect this stellar growth to continue over the course of our forecast period, rising to 9% this year and peaking at 11% in 2016, marking Turkmenistan out as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the long run. Growth will continue to be driven by expansion of the energy sector, in particular, gas.Turkmenistan has the world's fourth largest gas reserves and gas exports are set to expand dramatically over the coming years as new capacity comes online. Continued diversification of export destinations will also help to bolster the energy sector's potential. While Russia remains Turkmenistan's main export partner, the government inaugurated new pipeline routes to China and Iran last year, and is set to increase export volumes to these economies rapidly over the coming years. Plans are also in motion to develop pipelines to India and Europe . While significant risks of delays to these projects exist, the country's diversification strategy will help to further reduce its dependence on Russia. Recycling Of Energy Revenues Foreign direct investment to develop the oil and gas sectors was reportedly as high as US$10bn in 2010 and we expect interest to continue picking up. Not only does Turkmenistan have vast untapped resources that will require foreign expertise and capital to develop, but President Berdymukhamedov has sought a more open and balanced foreign policy in the past two years. This has helped draw in foreign firms from around the world, most notably Asia and the Middle East, but also the US and Western Europe. This is a dynamic we expect to continue this year. That said, we do not expect similar levels of FDI to flow into the non-hydrocarbon sectors of the economy. It will likely remain incumbent on the government to recycle energy export revenues in order to expand these sectors. This has certainly paid dividends thus far, with the agriculture, pharmaceutical, textile and construction sectors all showing healthy growth rates in 2010. Development of these sectors will nonetheless lag behind the oil and gas industry given the added efficiencies and expertise that come with foreign capital, which will, in turn, leave the country heavily dependent on commodity prices.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 38 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Competitive Landscape Executive Summary The main government vehicle is state-owned Turkmenneft. IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. Petronas began producing from the Diyarbakir field in 2006. Petronas production increased from 4,700b/d of oil in the financial year ending March 31 2008 to 6,400b/d in FY08-09. Petronas has started up an onshore gas terminal and gas processing plant on Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast, in order to allow production to begin from its offshore Block-1 assets. The block has long been seen as a potential source of gas for export to Europe via the much-mooted Southern Corridor, but the absence of infrastructure makes this unlikely in the short term. Although gas from the block will initially be sent to Russia, over the long term exports to Europe are still possible. In February 2008 Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2010, Eni produced an average of 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2009. In 2010 Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production, contributing around 47,200b/d. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea. Germanys RWE Dea in July 2009 announced that it signed a PSA to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. RWE will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities at the block between 2010 and 2014. The State Information Agency of Turkmenistan announced the start of production at the Yylakly field in the Central Karakum desert in early July 2009. First oil from the field, which was developed by subsidiaries of Turkmenneft, was transported to an oil facility around 65km south of the field, then to the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries. State-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary reported in August 2008 that the South Gutlyayak field is producing some 200,000cm/d of gas and condensate, equal to 73Mcm per annum.

Source: BMI Company Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Overview/State Role Licensing And Regulation In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been PSAs. The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. Turkmenistan's energy ministry has said it will not invite foreign oil and gas explorers to invest in its onshore gas fields, Reuters reported in March 2011. External players will therefore only be allowed to carry out exploration and production in the country's sector of the Caspian Sea. They will, however, be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn of cumulative investment in hydrocarbons sector by 2010, but the figure proved a serious overestimation. In 2010, the government believes it will receive US$4bn, up from US$2bn in 2009. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI at US$753mn. Government Policy Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 At least US$5bn per year over the next decade will need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMXs Jennifer Coolige argued there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be opening up under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya Basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. State-run Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan said in November 2009. This was not confirmed by Turkmen officials but in October 2010, government sources said Chervon and French major Total are negotiating their entrance into the Turkmen Caspian Shelf. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month International Energy Relations Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010 an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has been aggressively pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. In 2008 Russia paid US$140 per thousand cubic metres for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late-2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. Although the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In January 2011 it was announced that Gazprom will buy around 38bcm of gas from Central Asian nations during 2011. This represents an increase of 2% y-o-y from about 38bcm in 2010. It is not clear how much of this will come from Turkmenistan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010 Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. An onward link to Tehran was completed by the Iranians in November 2010. The Dauletabad-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Iran has long been seen as a potential exporter of gas to Europe, or as a transit route for Central Asian gas. The completion of the second Turkmenistan-Iran gas pipeline makes this plan far more feasible. However, the main problems with the project have long been political rather than technological, with the EU currently opposed to Iranian gas imports. This stance appears to be justified by a US diplomatic communiqu released by website Wikileaks. According to the cable, Iran is interested in exporting gas to the EU in the belief that this will increase its political leverage and to help insulate it from sanctions. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Tehran in February 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which covers a total of about 7,000km, transports gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008 Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 India and Turkmenistan have agreed to step up energy cooperation after high-level discussions during Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's first visit to India. The two sides expressed interest in several projects to transport Turkmen gas to India, including the long-mooted TAPI pipeline. However, BMI sees the political, security and technical challenges to the project as overwhelming making a gas-swap deal with Iran a more likely option. The proposed US$4bn TAPI pipeline would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to India, which joined the project in 2008. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan would receive 1bcm per year from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 5bcm per year afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. TAPI was originally proposed in the mid-1990s by a US-led consortium but the project was placed on the back burner after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. While the war in Afghanistan has continued this has remained the case, and India and Pakistan's fractious relations have also stymied any further progress. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious TAPI pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Turkmenistan, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed another deal for the pipeline in December 2010. Russia signed an agreement in January 2011 with Afghanistan to help build the proposed TAPI gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. Although Russian involvement could boost the project's chances of going ahead, it undermines TAPI's aim of diversifying Central Asia's gas export routes away from Russia.

Company Oil production Market share Gas production Company Business Monitor International Ltd Page 47 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Company Monitor Eni Company Analysis Italian major Eni acquired a foothold in Turkmenistan through its takeover of UK-based Burren Energy in 2007. In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov.

In January 2008, Eni had secured 77% of Burren in an agreed GBP1bn. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In its latest annual report Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2010, suggesting its existing producing assets have reached a plateau. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Latest Developments Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy in November 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. In April 2008, Turkmenistan refused to issue entry visas to Enis managers, illustrating the governments irritation that it was not consulted about Enis takeover of Burrens assets. However, operations are said to be continuing as normal as former Burren employees that are now working for Eni are allowed to continue to travel in and out of the country, according to an Eni spokesperson. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies pursuing a steady drilling effort in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Substantial domestic oil producer Strong relationship with government Early entrance into and established position in market Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Lack of developed infrastructure Opportunities: Rise in regional oil and gas consumption Long-term export opportunities Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address Dragon Oil Plc, ENOC House II Third Floor Right Wing Sheikh Rashid Road Dubai, UAE Tel: +971 4 305 3660 Fax: +971 4 335 6954 www.dragonoil.com Financial Statistics Revenues: US$780mn US$623mn US$706mn US$597mn US$325mn Net profit: US$386mn US$259mn US$369mn US$304mn US$187mn Operating Statistics Oil production: 47,211b/d 44,765b/d 40,992b/d 32,000b/d 20,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Market Position The Emirates National Oil Company , itself owned by the government of Dubai, holds a 52% share in London- and Dublin-listed Dragon Oil. The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of 8-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early-2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rising to a record 44,765b/d in 2009. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, down US$100mn from the 2009-2011 period. As of 2010 the company claims cumulative investment of US$1bn in the country. In late 2010 it announced plans to boost output to 75,000b/d, without specifying the projects involved. Dragon plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including five appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Latest Developments Dragon Oil has commenced drilling with the Dzheitune 13 platform in the Caspian Sea, reports Rigzone. It follows a refit of the previously stacked Rig 40. The Dzheitune 13/160 development well has already been spudded by the rig and will be the first of four wells drilled from the platform. According to a Bloomberg report in April 2011, Dragon Oil expects production growth of as much as 20% this year as it adds wells. Three new wells have been put into production this year, the Dubai-based company said in a Regulatory News Service statement. The average daily production rate was about 57,800 bbl in the three months ended March 31, up from 47,600b/d a year earlier. The company upgraded its reserves to 639mn bbl of oil and condensate at the year-end and 1trillion cubic feet of gas . Dragon maintained its medium-term production target of 10-15% growth on average per annum between 2011 and 2013. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Dragon Oil's oil production hit 52,575b/d in December 2010. This was up 10% y-o-y, compared with 47,463b/d of oil production in December 2009. Average daily oil production in 2010 was up 5% y-o-y to 47,211b/d, compared with 44,765b/d in 2009. Production rose owing to the launch of new facilities and the removal of infrastructural bottlenecks. The companys reserves at its Turkmenistan field rose by 3% y-o-y to 639mn bbl of oil and condensate. Gas reserves at the field are 45bcm. Dragon completed initial testing of the Dzheitune 28/151 development well in early January 2011. A 14-inch in-field pipeline running from the Dzheitune B platform to the Dzheitune 28 platform has also been commissioned. The well, drilled to a total depth of 3,512m with the NIS rig, flowed at an initial combined rate of 2,656b/d of oil. Dragon finished the first drilling and completion phase at two of its Caspian wells in November 2010. The Dzheitune B/148 and 28/149 development wells are part of a series to be drilled at the Dzheitune B platform offshore Turkmenistan. B/148 has been drilled to a depth of 3,858m and 28/149 reached a depth of 3,295m. In mid-May 2010, Dragon Oil issued details of contracts it had awarded to construct two rig platforms in its Cheleken contract area, in the Turkmen waters of the Caspian Sea. The company believes that the platforms, which will allow the drilling of up to 16 new wells, will help the company achieve its production targets. The Dzhygalybeg A platform, to be built by Q112, will support a land rig and a jack-up rig and will allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Zhdanov field. The Dzheitune C platform, to be built by Q411, will support a jack-up rig and allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Lam Field. In April 2010, Dragon Oil announced that it had reached an agreement with a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company on a new short-term deal to replace a crude oil swap agreement that expired on 31 March 2010. The swap deal signed with NIOC subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company involves Dragon exporting its Turkmen crude to the Iranian Caspian port of Bandar Neka, where it is then marketed locally. In exchange, NIOC allocates Iranian crude oil to Dragon at the Kharg Island terminal, located in the Persian Gulf. Dragon Oil increased its 2009 full-year production by 9% to 44,765b/d of oil. The company put eight development wells into production in 2009. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Petronas Summary Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has told the Turkmen government that it could be producing up to 5bcm of gas from Block 1, with production expected to be increased to 10bcm at a later stage. Currently only oil is produced from the field. President Berdymukhamedov met Petronas former president, Hassan Marican, on May 15 2009 to discuss the companys Turkmenistan activities, according to Reuters. Petronas estimates that the field has 150bcm of reserves. In June 2009 Petronas said it would start installation work at Block 1 in early-2010. The facilities at the block will include a drilling platform, a wellhead platform and offshore pipelines. Offshore contractor Sigur Ros has signed a letter of intent to supply the crew and equipment required for the pipe laying work. First gas from the first phase of the block was scheduled for Q310 but appears to have been delayed. Petronas has started up an onshore gas terminal and gas processing plant on Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast, in order to allow production to begin from its offshore Block-1 assets. The block has long been seen as a potential source of gas for export to Europe via the much-mooted Southern Corridor, but the absence of infrastructure makes this unlikely in the short term. Although gas from the block will initially be sent to Russia, over the long term exports to Europe are still possible. The gas processing plant and onshore terminal, located at Kiyanly near the Caspian Sea port of Trkmenbay, were launched on July 12 2011 according to a report by Malaysian national news agency Bernama. The processing plant comprises two process trains with a combined capacity of up to 10bcm per annum. The plant is linked to a 53km gas pipeline which flows into the Central Asia-Centre 3 export pipeline. The facilities involved an investment of US$5bn, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told Bernama. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. CNPC has reported what appears to be a major gas discovery in September 2010. CNPC reported that exploration well Oja-21 in Block B maintained a flow of 1mn Mcm/d of gas and 36cm/d of condensate during testing. The company has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bn bcm of reserves. PetroChina said in early September 2009 that it would pay US$1bn to its parent company CNPC for its share of the Amu Darya Right Bank gas field in Turkmenistan. The field, which is scheduled to come onstream by the end of 2009, is earmarked to supply the second West-East gas pipeline that will transport gas to Shanghai. Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. In April 2003, the Russian and Turkmen presidents signed a bilateral cooperation agreement covering natural gas, which will remain in force from January 1 2004 until December 31 2028. Within the deal, state-controlled Turkmenneftegaz agreed a contract for the supply of Turkmen natural gas over the same period. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 in its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Gazprom Summary Itera Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 54 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal on September 13 2009 with Turkmenistan to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which have been tense since April following an explosion on Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite its dispute with Gazprom. Discussions on the project had been ongoing since February 18. By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its former partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for 16 years and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman Igor Makarov, this is the first time the company has been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Preliminary estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas a year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April when RWEs CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistans President Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which has been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3D seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. The company in April 2010 said it would invest US$60-80mn in the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said to have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. RWE Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 55 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. The deal is yet to materialise. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil has returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010 in response to earlier media reports. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Canadian-registered independent Buried Hill Energy claimed that it signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan, confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Serbia's oil monopoly Naftna Industrija Srbije has won an upstream deal in Turkmenistan valued at US$33mn, the company said in a January 12 2011 statement quoted by Reuters. NIS will drill two 4,800m wells in the Akpatlauk oil field, two 3,800m wells in the Ekerem oil field and one 4,500m well in the Keimir oil field, all of which are being developed by state-run Turkmenneft. The project is expected to start in June 2011 and be completed by February 2012. Petrofac Among the Western firms, Petrofac has gained a major first mover advantage in Turkmenistan, winning a deal to develop the giant South Yolotan field on behalf of state-run Turkmengaz in 2009. In mid-2010, construction began on a new US$2bn pipeline, with 30bcm of capacity, connecting South Yolotan-Osman to Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast. Petrofac completed work on South Yolotan's first Others Summary Service Companies Business Monitor International Ltd Page 56 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 phase in December 2009, working as a contractor to state-run Turkmengaz. That contract was worth US$100mn. In the same month, Petrofac won a contract to undertake a FEED study and initial planning for the second phase infrastructure. South Yolotan represents Petrofac's sole ongoing Turkmen operation. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the project's US$3bn second phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. The second phase will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 57 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Oil And Gas Outlook: Long-Term Forecasts Regional Oil Demand A continuation of the 2010-2015 oil demand trend is predicted for the 2015-2020 period, reflecting the under-developed nature of several key economies, ongoing wealth generation thanks to rising export volumes, plus the maturing of new EU member states. The regions oil consumption is expected to increase by 15% in 2015-2020, after 14% growth in the period 2010-2015. Over the extended 2010 to 2020 forecast period, Azerbaijan leads the way, with oil demand increasing by an estimated 97%, followed by Uzbekistan (+90%) and Turkmenistan (+62%) and Kazakhstans 57% growth. Poland and Croatia lag the field, as a result of greater market maturity and the lack of hydrocarbons income that stimulates economies elsewhere in the region.

Kazakhstan is by far the biggest contributor to growth, with output forecast to rise by 53% between 2010 and 2020. Turkmenistan exceeds it in percentage terms (+76%), but is a much smaller absolute contributor. Russia has the weakest production trend among the major producers, with a likely 6% gain between 2010 and 2020.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 59 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Regional Refining Capacity CEE is set for a 7% increase in crude distillation capacity between 2010 and 2020, contributing to the further growth of the already bloated global refining industry. Cheap and plentiful local crude supplies help make it a region of choice for refinery investment, although government control of the downstream industry will need to be eased. Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey have particularly ambitious expansion plans, reflecting either crude output growth or local demand expansion. Although we do not expect all, or even most, of these projects to be realised, the region should increase in importance as a net exporter of refined products.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Turkmenistan Country Overview Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 56%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d at the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption is set to increase by 62% between 2010 and 2020, with growth of 5% per annum and the country using 204,000b/d by 2020. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 42bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 20bcm to 95bcm. In terms of oil and gas supply, as well as refining capacity, the projections are wherever possible based on known development projects, committed investment plans or stated government/company intentions. A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historical reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

Our approach has been threefold. First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all 16 industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline Oil & Gas BER is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of Upstream/Downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients, who will have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite for their operations. Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% Upstream BER and 50% Downstream BER: Upstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Upstream rating which is composed of limits/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Downstream rating which comprises limits/risks . Both the Upstream BER and Downstream BER are composed of Limits/Risks sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader Country Risk components: Limits of Potential Returns: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Ratings Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 65 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Risks to Realisation of those Returns: Evaluates both Industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 69 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts BMI's industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 70 Turkmenistan Report Q4 2011 Energy Industry There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy Supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: national energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; international quotas, guidelines and projections, such as OPEC, IEA, US Energy Information Administration . Energy Consumption A mixture of methods is used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historical relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts, based on company- or state-specific investment levels Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third-party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Cross Checks Sources Sources include those international bodies mentioned above, such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news agencies.

db94aa64-1383-47a3-9da5-4f8409cc46e1,"Dominant voices in the energy security debate describe the competition for energy resources as a zero-sum, realist game that will lead to future resource wars among prominent system-shaping states. However, the complex set of interlinked political, economic, and security issues that make up energy security involves ""big"" and ""small"" states. Complex interdependence provides a different lens to view power in situational and relational terms and thus a more comprehensive way to measure a state's potential influence. This article examines the foreign-policy behavior of energy-rich ""small"" states in Central Asia, specifically Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, in the context of their ""big"" neighbors, particularly Russia and China. The goal is to begin to explain the energy dynamic within Central Asia and the bargaining process that is reshaping Central Asia's interlinked political, economic, and security relationships. KEYWORDS: energy security, complex interdependence, Central Asia, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan. THE WORLD COMMUNITY HAS ENTERED THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WITH ever-growing energy demands, increasing energy costs and volatility of supply, and the perception of shrinking access to secure energy resources. These realities, and the fact that energy resources are found only in a few countries, take trade in energy out of the realm of ordinary ""low"" policy in which it is assumed that basic laws of supply and demand are determining. Due to their scarcity and link to future development, energy resources take on some of the strategic characteristics of ""high"" policy. The ongoing competition for energy resources leads many to see a future of resource wars, particularly in the context of large producing states such as Russia and large consumers such as the United States and China that fuel global demand. But this zero-sum lens misses the growing interdependent political, economic, and security relationships among producing, consuming, and energy transit countries. In fact, the high-versus-low policy distinction presents a false dichotomy. The reality is a complex set of fluid, asymmetrical relationships in which all states have a certain level of dependency and influence. By the numbers, the importance of the Caspian Sea region in the global energy equation is quite small. For example, its oil accounts for only 2-3 percent of the world's known resources, and its gas for only 4-5 percent. However, its relative proximity to Russian, European, and Chinese markets and the tightness of the world energy market make these resources a source of potentially critical leverage. The possession of vital, expensive, and sought-after energy resources in large amounts provides certain small states with foreignpolicy choices and strategic advantages that they would not normally possess. But the CentralAsian energy equation is not a simple one. Given the vast distances involved, the process of extracting and transporting these resources requires a big commitment by the parties involved. Russia has the advantage of long-term cultural and political ties to the region and a ready, although aging, pipeline and grid infrastructure that routes CentralAsian energy exports through Russia. In contrast, China's ready cash reserves that are available for investment in new pipelines and infrastructure vital to the region have changed the nature of the game. These circumstances give new options and opportunities to Central Asia's energy-rich states. In this context, Central Asian states forge ahead to re-create their identity as important regional actors rather than just remaining a place acted upon by outside great powers such as Russia and China. This article asks how energy-rich Central Asian states work to avoid being sandwiched between the regional giants or to become victims of a new resource ""great game."" To address this question, we examine the impact of the foreign-policy behavior of energy-rich small states in Central Asia, specifically Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, in the context of their ""big"" neighbors, particularly Russia and China. Given their relative poverty, geographic isolation, and close historical and functional ties to Russia, these states seek to step out of the shadow of their former master. China's rapid rise offers the opportunity for new markets and ties that may balance Russian influence and potentially change the geopolitical dynamic in Central Asia. The goal is to begin to explain the energy dynamic within Central Asia, and the bargaining process that is shaping current Asian political, economic, and security relationships.We address a number of interrelated questions focusing on the broader geopolitical context and the tools available to energy-rich states: How has the complex energy-interdependent system developing in Central Asia changed regional relationships? What strategy and tools do small states such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan use to increase their control over their energy resources and future? How has their growing activism influenced the energy game in Central Asia? How do Russia and China guarantee access to Central Asia's energy resources in a situation of complex interdependence? Understanding Energy Security in a World of Complex Interdependence Currently the world is facing a new security challenge due to growing energy demands, decreasing cheap fossil fuel resources, and emerging energy nationalism. According to the 2010 World Energy Outlook, world primary energy demand will increase by 36 percent between 2008 and 2035, or 1percent per year on average . In this context, many security scholars see a future in which states compete for scarce resources, reinforcing the zero-sum nature of global politics in general. This perspective often shapes the discussion of energy as a strategic commodity. Scholars such as Michael Klare and Paul Roberts, for example, argue that the condition of rising powers and diminishing energy resources can produce a dangerous competition among countries, since energy resources have acquired a prominence in world politics that rivals military power in importance. Klare suggests that a ""New International Energy Order"" is developing that divides countries into competing energy-surplus and energy-deficient nations . The nationalization of key energy sectors in several energyproducing states-reflected, for example, in Russia's pipeline politics or China's ""go forth"" policies-illustrates this mercantilist tendency . These writers often predict a process in which conflict over energy is imminent unless preventive actions are taken. This sentiment gets press in periodicals such as the Oil and Gas Journal regarding the CentralAsian context. Bahgat in June 2009 noted the intense and growing competition among China, Europe, and Russia over oil and gas from Central Asia. The Russian advantage is noted in terms of decades-long cultural and political ties. China is the emerging competitor given its deep pockets, while European companies offer more advanced technology than is available from either of these competitors . The energy equation is complicated by the geographically uneven distribution of energy deposits across the globe and within regional contexts. From the perspective of security of supply for importing states, the difficult transportation routes that make energy shipments go through a few ""chokepoints"" is a major concern . But energy-exporting countries share similar concerns, such as the security of demand and transportation to get their commodity to the market. Long-term demand security is important to ensure a predictable flow of revenues. These countries also heavily depend on limited transportation choices and routes, which means that they share the concerns of energy-importing countries on the security of supply . For those who embrace the age of globalization and the perceived opportunities that come with economic interdependence, security analyses provide an incomplete picture of the energy game. From both a security studies and an international political economy perspective, little literature deals with energy security beyond how some scholars apply the major international relations paradigms to explain the function of energy markets . Security studies provide the basis for the zero-sum lens. The IPE literature is guided by the premise that economic systems rest on a particular political order with certain values, norms, and expectations, and that these interdependent relations change the behavior of the actors involved . Maneuvering amid Complex Interdependence The concept of complex interdependence, coined by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, describes a world in between these two perspectives. Nations are calculating actors but also are so interconnected through a web of interdependence that common interests and shared vulnerabilities shape opportunities for cooperation and prospects for competition. In the age of complex interdependence, modern states are interlinked with each other to such an extent that the notion of ""hierarchy"" diffuses and the use of force is discouraged and counterproductive.While states that are interdependent are sensitive to external change, their vulnerability to the system is measured by their ability to respond to changes effectively . Power is measured by their ability to manipulate asymmetrical relationships. In this vein, shared vulnerabilities and shared interests give leaders opportunities and constraints in the choices they make. Even though fossil fuels are a vital source of influence, other factors such as markets and technology, investments, and trade, which are central to promoting energy extraction, are important because they entangle countries in a web of complex interdependence. Despite the inclination toward energy nationalism, energy-surplus countries have their own vulnerabilities, such as the difficulty of exploration, extraction, and transportation of fossil fuels as well as internal and regional instabilities. They also can be constrained by a lack of technology and limited ability to control demand and production. Ultimately, the energy-exporting countries heavily depend on energy revenues and foreign investments as well as long-term security of demand. These constraints and vulnerabilities can compel states and their leaders to search for shared interests and common ground for collaboration. Russia, for example, needs Chinese investments and Japanese technology to take advantage of its vast energy resources . A number of countries engage in strategic energy dialogues with this interdependent reality in mind. China engages in a number of bilateral strategic dialogues and uses organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as vehicles to promote energy cooperation with Central Asian states. Similarly, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has strategic dialogues with other producers as well as with consumers, noting the interests that are shared. The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, echoes this sentiment by noting the shared interests of consuming, producing, and transiting countries, all of which are becoming increasingly dependent on one another. ""Security of supply is important for us, but other countries seek security of demand. This is the age of energy interdependence"" . This brief discussion of geopolitics and complex interdependence illustrates that states are constrained actors in regional and global contexts. But energy resources provide new options. For example, in explaining the change that took place in the international oil regime after 1973, Joseph Nye notes that the OPEC embargo and oil crisis led to an enormous shift of power and wealth from the industrialized world to the developing world . The decline of US power altered the stability of the existing energy ""regime."" Further domestic political responses shaped how deeply the United States and others were affected by external shocks. Acknowledging both the domestic and foreign sides of the energy security coin, Daniel Yergin incorporates factors such as building cooperative relations with producer and consumer states, a proactive foreign policy that prevents disruptions of the chain of supply, and domestic strategies to promote energy security. The Possibilities for Small States Within the realist tradition in the international relations literature, the size of a state often is used to explain its potential for independent foreign policy behavior. The distinction made among great powers, middle powers, and small powers is an attempt to ascribe different levels of potential influence within the global system. In this context, the great powers hold undisputable potential power advantages over small states . Historically, those who have focused on small-state foreign policy take the structural perspective that small states are limited in the foreign policy choices they have vis-à-vis big powers and in shaping policy outcomes to fit their goals. The principal finding of the field is that small states-as measured by the size of the military, population, or area-are more vulnerable than others to the vagaries of international and regional systems. They are assumed to go along with the system rather than attempt to change it. Some analysts, such asAnnette Baker Fox, claim that small states have persuasive power, meaning they aspire to neutrality and limited alignments. Similarly, Peter Katzenstein notes that smallness will result in active participation and promotion of the international system rather than gamechanging behavior . Jeanne Hey, on the other hand, explains how perceptions of smallness are what matter. Essentially, if you and others perceive yourself as a small state, then you see yourself with limited choices and ability to affect policy outcomes . But the concept also leaves room for flexibility. However, in a world of complex interdependence, which is the focus of this analysis, smaller states also have their own strengths and resources and can seize new opportunities. Laura Neack sees the presence of critical natural resources as one such source of leverage to pursue more independent foreign policies . From this perspective, the potential influence of states, and their proxies in the game , depend on various features of the host country as well as the companies themselves. These features include the size of the investment, its share of the project, the percentage of a host country's oil or gas exports taken by a particular country or company, the relative strength of a host country's economy, the extent of its diversification, and its reliance on energy exports for influence. The vulnerability to the dictates of outside countries and national energy companies hinges on factors such as the political stability and capabilities of the host state and the international alignment of forces around them . CentralAsia offers a look at smaller states that have traditionally been beholden to their wealthier neighbors but now are coping with relatively new energy wealth. They offer a context to evaluate how energy wealth has changed the nature of their traditional dependent relationships with Russia. Putting Central Asia into Context: Changing Historical Alignments and the Energy Game Competition for Oil In the Central Asian context, zero-sum perspectives have dominated the analyses of the region as a whole. This perspective was especially popular in the early years of the independence of CentralAsian states when scholars perceived Central Asia as a ""grand chessboard,"" reminiscent of the eighteenth-century Russian-British rivalry and the struggle of the great powers for influence and dominance. Central Asian governments were viewed merely as pawns unable to influence the course of the game. Scholars such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frederick Starr had little trust in the ability of these countries to stay stable without being guided and dominated by one or another great power .With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly independent energy-rich republics again were seen as a playground for great-power rivalry: a new great game was predicted to describe the rivalry between theWest and a weakened Russia for control of Eurasia's energy resources . The geography of Central Asia has contributed to the analyses categorizing them as weak states acted upon by outsiders. Central Asia is a landlocked geographic region located in the strategic heart of the Eurasian landmass. This region's importance is primarily connected to its location between great powers and its natural resources, which its neighbors covet. Since the independence of these states, outside interest in their resources has grown. It is precisely this competition for the region's resources that provides various CentralAsian states with new leverage. Petroleum is the natural resource that we think about first as the game changer in the CentralAsian context because it has received the greatest amount of Western investment. Based on oil reserves, production figures, and geography, Kazakhstan is the coveted prize in the oil game. Kazakhstan has about half of Russia's total of 60 billion barrels in reserves and holds more than the 21billion barrels that the United States is estimated to have . This oil is also geopolitically well placed because Kazakhstan is the only country that China can import it from directly overland without it passing through Russia first. In 2009 Kazakhstan produced 1million barrels per day , and with the continued expansion of its large Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan fields this output is expected to double by 2019 . Large-scaleWestern investment in the oil sector began in the early 1990s with formation of the Caspian Basin Consortium, which has exported millions of barrels to the European market. The most lucrative oil field, Tengiz, with estimated recoverable reserves of 7billion barrels, began to be exploited by US-based Chevron-Texaco and Kazakhstan in a consortium in 1993. The Kazakhs welcomed Western international oil companies because the Kazakhs needed expertise and equipment, which the Russians lacked, to develop the field. The government saw such joint ventures as helpful to Kazakhstan's modernization efforts and proof that Kazakhstan welcomed outside investment. Despite this, getting the oil out has been an ongoing challenge. Under a 1998 deal, the Russian government agreed to build a pipeline from Tengiz in two phases. The first, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels a day, has been built, butMoscow has refused to complete the second phase, which would more than double the pipeline's capacity to over 1million barrels a day . In 2002 another prominent consortium led by Italy's Eni reported that the new Kashagan offshore field in the Caspian rivaled Tengiz with 7-9 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. This oil reaches multiple international markets with destinations in Russia, China, Europe, and Turkey. In late 2010, 23percent of its oil flowed to Italy, 15 percent to China, 11percent to France, and 7percent to Austria Kazakhstan has followed a strategy that diversifies transportation routes in a multivectored energy export policy. As such, the Kazakh government seeks multiple pipelines and markets to ensure that no regional power can exercise strategic control over its energy exports and its broader economic future Natural Gas Exporting Natural gas is the newcomer in the CentralAsian energy export game. Just a few short years ago Central Asian gas was a commodity considered too difficult to produce except by Russia. CentralAsia's three natural gas providers with the greatest potential-Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan-all have faced the challenge to diversify their markets to make planned natural gas exports viable beyond Russia . Both Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have significant reserves but have needed a new infusion of funds to increase production. Uzbekistan is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the Commonwealth of Independent States after Russia, and has sped up production at existing fields and sought to develop new fields primarily with the help of Russia's giant state gas company, Gazprom. With Gazprom, Uzbekistan plans to spend $1billion to revamp natural gas pipelines in the region to boost exports through Russia. In contrast, Turkmenistan has sought to open new opportunities beyond Russia . modernization efforts and proof that Kazakhstan welcomed outside investment.

In contrast, Turkmenistan has sought to open new opportunities beyond Russia . 390 Explaining the Central Asian Energy Game Getting the resource to markets beyond Russia has required significant political and economic effort because of the existing grid structure that has gas routed north through Russia. For example, China's President Hu Jintao's efforts to link a gas field in Turkmenistan to its western Xinjiang region succeeded in getting broad regional support. This required the cooperation of the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan in a joint commissioning of a pipeline that transected each of their countries. The opening of this pipeline marked the end of Russia's near-monopoly over Central Asian natural gas exports. It is the first high-volume export route for Turkmen gas that does not go through Russia. The new pipeline handles 30-40 billion cubic meters per year, while the Turkmenistan pipeline to Russia handles between 50 and 70 bcm per year. Full capacity is slated to be reached by 2012, but Turkmenistan and China have already completed preliminary agreements to add another 10 bcm in the future . Acloser look at the Kazakh oil equation and Turkmenistan's natural gas game from a complex interdependence perspective will show Kazakhstan's and Turkmenistan's efforts to gain control over their own energy resources. Regional alignments are undergoing significant shifts. Analysts who ignore the role of small states miss a significant piece of the energy puzzle. Changing the Rules in the Kazakh Petroleum Equation Kazakhstan's massive reserves and potential as a major exporter provide it with greater potential influenceIts oil and gas production have tripled in the last decade, and its Kashagan field is the largest field outside theMiddle East and the fifth largest in terms of world reserves. Multiple investor opportunities, particularly in the context of high energy prices and high demand, have helped Kazakhstan tap its wealth. The astute manipulation of new opportunities has helped it gain leverage vis-à-vis its neighbors. No longer doWestern and Russian energy investors dominate Kazakh energy investments as they did during the 1990s. One reason for this is the growing presence of China in the mix. China and New Diversification Opportunities For over a decade China has played a growing role in Central Asia, and frequent energy discussions have provided greater opportunities for both sides. China's first deal came in 1997, when its China National Petroleum Corporation bought a 60 percent share of the Aktobemunaigaz oil company for $4billion. Later that year CNPC won the controlling interest in Uzen, the second-largest oil field in Kazakhstan. The next year the two countries agreed in principle to build a nearly 3,000-kilometer oil pipeline linking Kazakh oil fields with China's Xinjiang Province in a deal to be financed by CNPC over twenty years . Despite initial enthusiasmfor these deals, however, projects were delayed for several years. The discovery of Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan oil field, China's disappointments with Russia's unwillingness to open access to its oil and gas reserves, and domestic energy shortages spurred the Chinese leadership again to look to CentralAsia for energy. This context provided a new opportunity for Kazakhstan. As a result, in March 2003 CNPC and the Kazakh state oil company, KazMunaiGaz , moved forward to jointly construct the westernmost section of the cross-border oil pipeline, running 448 kilometers from Atyrau to Kenkiyak in Kazakhstan. The easternmost part of the pipeline, running 988 kilometers from Atasu in Kazakhstan to Alashankou at the Chinese border, was completed at the end of 2005 and became operational in May 2006 with a total investment of just under $800 million . The final section, the Kenkiyak-to-Kumkol piece, started operations in October 2009 with completion of the 761- kilometer Kenkiyak-to-Kumkol pipeline section. These joint ventures are hardly an even split in terms of resources expended. While the Kazakh-China pipeline project was billed as a fifty-fifty joint venture between KMG and CNPC, the Chinese company paid 85 percent of the cost. Only 12million barrels flowed through it in 2006, but capacity was reached in 2010 with 73million barrels of crude exported as of the end of the year. With the completion of the second phase of the project in 2013 the capacity can increase to 146million barrels per year . The pipeline can accept crude oil deliveries from the north , the west, or the south from Kazakhstan's Turgai basin. To function effectively, the pipeline needs Russian oil to supplement Kazakh contributions because of insufficient fill and viscosity issues . The purpose of the pipeline may be to provide a long-term, strategically secure source of oil rather than to meet immediate demand requirements. Still, Kazakh oil now provides 15 percent of China's imports. China's purchase of PetroKazakhstan and its new assets in the Turgai basin will improve the pipeline's efficiency because the oil fields feed the pipeline at its midpoint. For example, Petrokaz's combined assets in the Turgai basin produce around 150,000 bpd of crude, which could go directly into the pipeline . Through the Petrokaz acquisition, CNPC also gained a 50 percent stake in the Kazgermunai field . To secure these deals, CNPC has agreed to invest nearly $4 billionmore over the next twenty years to develop other areas . China has become a more attractive partner because its government- backed national oil companies also have been more willing to invest up front in big infrastructure projects. For example, China's CNPC agreed to foot the whole bill for the oil pipeline from CentralAsia when no one else would. China's NOCs aggressively follow an acquisition strategy in which they purchase stakes in exploration and production activities and whole firms, and where needed partner in joint ventures, finance infrastructure projects, market petroleum products, and operate facilities . China also has begun to invest more broadly in Kazakhstan and other CentralAsian states and now rivals Russia in terms of its foreign trade with Kazakhstan. In 2009 China's share of Kazakh trade was 21percent, compared to Russia's 17percent, a gap that continues to widen over time . Chinese trade is vital for Kazakhstan and other CentralAsian states because it fills a void in consumer goods and provisions to the region. China's goods are cheaper than theWest's and of higher quality than Russia's . These agreements and ties are significant and demonstrate the Chinese determination to develop closer ties with Kazakhstan's energy industry. The increase in exports to China also reflects a Kazakh calculation that closer ties to China's energy markets provide the country with greater security and diversified revenue streams. Kazakhstan's Efforts to Seek Better Deals Seeking diversification has allowed Kazakhstan to gain greater control over its energy security policy. The government inAstana now has greater confidence that it can set more favorable investment terms, and it is not afraid to use its leverage with the oil majors and NOCs. For example, the CNPC takeover of Petrokaz, noted above, with its investment of $4billion in 2005, led the Kazakh government to pressure CNPC to sell a 33 percent share of the company to Kazakhstan's KMG for a huge loss. The sale price undervalued Petrokaz as it gave advantageous terms to the Kazakh company . The Kazakh government forced CNPC to pay above market value for Petrokaz in the first place and forced it to undersell some of its assets to the government . Foreign firms can expect to be junior partners in future energy deals in Kazakhstan. This behavior reflects government dissatisfaction with previous production sharing agreements signed during desperate times in the 1990s when oil prices were low and foreign companies had the advantage. New practices reflect a new balance of power as old agreements are revisited. The Chinese multibilliondollar investments to develop Kazakhstan's energy resources, as well as investments in various pipeline projects, are not immune to a more active Kazakh government seeking better terms. The Kazakh government has taken specific steps to solidify its position vis-à-vis its energy partners. Following the Russian model of energy nationalism, which insists on state control of strategic assets, Astana introduced new laws in October 2007 that allow the Kazakh government to break natural resources contracts and force renegotiation. This puts pressure on projects involving both IOCs and NOCs in new and well-established partnerships. For example, the consortium of companies producing at its Kashagan-Caspian fields had an ongoing dispute with the government over production delays and cost overruns. The older PSAs for theAgip consortium delayed royalty payments until after its costs were recovered . These terms have been renegotiated. Further, KMG doubled its stake in the Kashagan venture to 16percent while the other shareholders were asked to take a cut . In this investment model, described by some as ""market- friendly resource nationalism,"" the state company renegotiates to become the dominant partner. This arrangement allows partners to co-invest in the country's oil sector . This change in Kazakh business practices indicates that a smaller state that has a resource its neighbors covet can take advantage of changed circumstances. Kazakhstan has leverage because it is one of the few places with untapped oil and gas reserves still open to investment. And it has neighbors and companies desperate to invest. The government gambles that new power asymmetries provide new opportunities and that companies will remain interested despite the new regulations. In 2010 Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev announced new practices that continue the pattern of asserting greater government control of the energy sector. He noted that foreign ventures enjoying special protective status may lose their immunity from changes in tax legislation. ""Times are changing and life is changing in the entire world, and state interests are pushing us in this direction. We have to work more thoroughly and constructively."" Kazakhstan continues to carefully reclaim its influence over its vast hydrocarbon wealth and to seek a greater role for the state oil and gas company . The Kazakh energy equation shows that the context for these relationships between states has changed. The government has successfully taken advantage of the Chinese market and high energy prices to create new options for its valuable energy resources and for foreign policy. From a leadership perspective we can anticipate continuity as Nazarbayev has been declared president for another ten years through 2020. Turkmenistan's Shifting Natural Gas Equation Commercially, CentralAsian natural gas has faced greater challenges than the Caspian oil sector due to its historic low prices, underdeveloped markets, and the remote location of its gas fields. Russia's state gas company, Gazprom, retains a near monopoly on Central Asian gas exports despite China's inroads; today 92 percent goes through Russia via the Central Asia-Center pipeline system, which feeds the Gazprom system. Through November 2007 Russia accounted for all of Turkmenistan's exports and most of its gas production . Turkmenistan is the prize in Central Asia's natural gas game, given its potential growth in production and lack of use for domestic purposes. Russia's dominance of the pipeline grid reflects an asymmetrical dependence equation with Russia on top and gas distribution largely dependent on the system built during the Soviet period, which routes all Turkmen exports through Russia The Central Asia-Center pipeline that connects Turkmen and Uzbek gas to the Druzhba pipeline going to Europe became a system of energy import and export operations between different countries after the breakup of the Soviet Union. This change made Russia an intermediary country with a pipeline monopoly over Turkmen gas exports. Historically Russia has bought Turkmen gas at low rates and sold at higher prices to Europe along with its own gas. Until 2003 Turkmenistan used to sell its gas at the rate of around $25/tcm , but the prices rose sharply, especially after Turkmenistan signed a twenty-five-year supply deal with Gazprom in 2003 at the rate of $44/tcm. Since then, the sides periodically renegotiate the prices; in the first quarter of 2009 the price reached $301/tcm. This was a high point, and the price has settled closer to $250/tcm since Turkmenistan does have some leverage vis-à-vis Russia. Turkmenistan is the single major source of natural gas that can help keep the supply sufficient for European markets.While the mutually converging interests for exports and imports seem to bind these two countries together, there are tensions However, frequent price disputes and the vulnerability Turkmenistan faces regarding the potential manipulation of its pipeline monopoly by Russia make the diversification of gas pipelines a desirable energy strategy for Turkmen leaders. Recent losses suffered due to a stoppage of exports to Russia in 2009 meant that its gas production fell to 38 bcm from 70bcm the previous year. This stoppage translated into a one-quarter drop in Turkmenistan's gross domestic product . Events such as theApril 9, 2009, pipeline explosion near the Turkmen-Uzbek border demonstrate the tensions. In that case, Turkmenistan accused Gazprom of deliberately arranging the explosion. Russia attempted to leverage Turkmenistan either to reduce the price or the volume of gas or a combination of both prior to resuming the gas flow . This is an example of complex interdependence in that Russia's role as the primary importer of Turkmen gas has actually given Turkmenistan some leverage. Turkmenistan's Diversification Options Turkmenistan's diversification options rest with new European Union market access and deals with China. For example, Turkmenistan has explored the feasibility of the Nabucco project, which would bring Caspian gas to Europe outside the Russian-controlled pipeline structure. In November 2008 Turkmenistan attended the Baku summit in Azerbaijan, which was dedicated to diversification of the Caspian basin energy resources beyond Russia. Later on, the Turkmen president met with the presidents of Turkey and Azerbaijan in Turkmenbashi to discuss the prospects for the trans-Caspian part of the Nabucco pipeline . More importantly, recent inroads with China show the clear goal to diversify more aggressively. Frequent top-level diplomatic visits between Turkmenistan and China, especially sinceApril 2006 when they signed a thirty-year gas export deal, have cemented a closer relationship The most significant example of this objective is the launch of the Turkmenistan-China gas pipeline in December 2009. The pipeline, which runs through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, had the full backing of Turkmenistan and China when proposed in 2007. The pipeline currently carries gas from Turkmenistan. It was expected to transport 4 bcm by the end of 2010, rising to 15 bcm in 2011 . The thirty-year supply deal with Turkmenistan signed in April 2006 exports gas from Turkmenistan via the new seventhousand- kilometer-long, $7billion pipeline . The deal has weathered a leadership change in Turkmenistan. In 2008 President Berdymukhammedov reassured his Chinese counterparts that the pipeline to China would go into operation as scheduled . In June 2009 Turkmenistan pledged to export 40 bcm per year, 10 bcm more than the original agreement. In exchange China provided $4 billion in soft loans to Turkmenistan to develop and improve its gas fields . The new gas pipeline came into operation in December 2009 . This pipeline helps to support the rapid increase in China's natural gas consumption, a harbinger for the need for large future imports. Official estimates put China's natural gas consumption at 10 percent of its annual total primary energy consumption by 2020; currently consumption is at 3percent of the total . Compared with other fossil fuels such as coal and oil, China's consumption of natural gas will growmore rapidly, in line with the government's plan to use more clean energy . As with its oil deals, China incentivizes its gas deals with broader trade and infrastructure investments. Along with the soft loan noted above, China announced a nearly $2billion investment in the pipeline fromTurkmenistan to China, involving CNPC and PetroChina . Moreover, China agreed to a loan of $3 billion to Turkmenistan to assist in developing the South Iolotan gas field to feed the Central Asian Gas Pipeline . Such deals sit within a broader economic and political fabric, which helps to overcome any resistance fromthe Turkmen side. Further, China has the cash for investment, unlike other countries, including Russia, that have been strapped for cash during the current credit crunch. This and other deals demonstrate China's forward- looking foreign policy and point to a future date when China will need to import natural gas. In 2009 China also surpassed Russia to be Turkmenistan's second-leading trade partner after Turkey. China accounts for 12percent while Russia accounts for 11percent of Turkmenistan's trade . China's advantage is that its goods cannot be matched by Russian goods in quality and are cheaper than goods from the United States or Japan. China also has a consistent record of providing other much-needed sweeteners that other countries do not, such as loans to buy Chinese commercial goods . China regularly funds infrastructure projects as well, including the billions of dollars in pipelines already noted and nearly $2 billion more destined to construct Central Asian connector highways. As a result, the economic ties that were in their infancy in the mid-1990s have expanded tremendously. In 1995, for instance, bilateral trade between China and the five Central Asian states totaled only $847 million, accounting for a modest 0percent of China's total foreign trade. By 2008 China's overall trade with the region grew significantly to reach just under $31 billion . Since then China has topped Russia in its trade with Central Asia. The complex interdependent nature of the relationships among Central Asian states and their big neighbors shows that strategic energy perspectives provide a much too unidimensional and static view of the natural gas energy equation. Conclusion The Central Asian oil and gas game necessitates a closer look at the complex interdependent relationships that have developed here and in other places. More than ever, traditional security analyses miss the dynamic nature of energy relationships and the factors that have empowered small energy states to influence their neighbors. The set of interdependencies illustrated just in the few energy deals noted here illustrates a more fluid decisionmaking context that challenges simple assumptions about how states should behave. The mercantilist tendencies of these states are not in doubt, but the circumstances that lead to a future of resource wars does not hold up. The energy game is much more than a competition between great powers over the resources of their weaker neighbors. While Russia and China are clearly locked in a competition for influence in Central Asia, what is debatable is their ability to influence outcomes in the traditional sense. Without taking the ""host"" states, such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, into account, too much of the policy puzzle is missed. In a system of complex energy interdependence, these small states are poised to play one country off the other. Their energy resources give them some ability to influence the asymmetries of the relationships, and increasingly they use this leverage to promote their foreign-policy interests. Countries such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have tangible resources at their fingertips that provide specific tools of influence. The combination of a strategic commodity such as needed energy resources, and a self-perception that they are not ""small,"" makes them more confident in their ability to manipulate their circumstances to their benefit. Energy is not just a regular trade commodity in this sense. Looking at small states as actors, rather than as merely those acted upon, demonstrates how states are mutually dependent and must constantly work to maintain working agreements. The choices that states make and ongoing broader bilateral relationships are better predictors of the energy game than deterministic zero-sum energy game assumptions. These games are volatile and involve a host of other related issues, including access to appropriate technology and financing for expensive pipeline projects. Thus, the security debate that dominates energy policy discussions fails to capture the nuances or the important everyday parts of the energy game. State behavior results from a series of foreign-policy choices. Looking inside the black box of state behavior is important to understand the energy equation and to analyze any small state's behavior. From a foreign-policy analysis perspective, this is essential if we want to understand how policy choices are made.While this approach is a challenge, more in-depth case studies can go a long way to improve our understanding of energy politics within the Central Asian context and beyond."
df844b8b-0068-4fb8-b905-2ad1001b185a,"INTRODUCTION Anna Politkovskaya was a rarity among journalists in Russia. Rather than comply with the will of President Vladimir Putin's regime and avoid politically disfavored topics, she wrote about the victims of ""Putin's Russia""-conscripted Russian soldiers, Chechen civilians, and others harmed by Russia's corrupt political and business eliteOn October 7, 2006, she left her apartment in Moscow to run errandsWhen she returned, a thin man dressed in a black baseball cap approached her in the entryway of her apartmentUsing the model of gun and method common among Russian hit men, the man shot her in the chest and headA surveillance camera from the building's lobby captured video of the assassinPolitkovskaya's reports had targeted a long list of powerful people, including Chechnyan President Ramzan Kadyrov, and the Kremlin itselfSpeculation immediately ensued about whether an official from one of these groups had ordered her killing Upon hearing of Politkovskaya's death, then-President Vladamir Putin addressed the issue three days laterHe downplayed the importance of her death by calling her ""insignificant"" and characterizing her as having no real influence within Russia and merely as a symbol for Western journalists and human rights organizationsPutin was correct that Politkovskaya, a dual U.S. and Russian citizen, was more famous in the West than in Russia; she has become the best-known example for international observers wishing to highlight the frequency of murdered journalists in RussiaDespite Putin's assertions of her insignificance, Politkovskaya's memory continues to hold importance for human rights activists and democracy supporters within Russia On July 15, 2009, journalist Natalya Estemirova was kidnapped as she left her house in Grozny, the Chechyan capitalFour gunmen grabbed her and threw her into a car as she screamed at the top of her lungsEight hours later, officials reported that her body had been found sixty miles away in neighboring Ingushetia, dumped in a wooded area, about 100 meters from the roadsideLike Politkovskaya, she had gunshot wounds to the chest and the head-hallmarks of an execution killing Estemirova had been documenting human rights abuses in ChechnyaMuch of her reporting centered on the crime of enforced disappearances, in which citizens are kidnapped and often tortured or killed by state agents or members of armed groups who deny that the person is being heldShe had investigated hundreds of such crimesHer articles contained accusations of torture and other abuses by government forces, which drew the attention of Kadyrov, the Chechen presidentKadyrov had expressed his displeasure with Estemirova's work both publicly and in a face-to-face meeting with her in March 2008Estemirova, a native Chechen, had worked in Grozny for eight years and, despite knowing the risk, continued her work nonetheless Her killing affected further investigations into human rights violations in ChechnyaMemorial, the human rights group Estemirova worked for, and Novaya Gazeta, Politkovskaya's former newspaper, both removed their representatives from Chechnya soon after Estemirova's death, stating that their employees were at too great a risk of harm Russia violates its domestic and international commitments when it fails to take steps to prevent the killings of journalists like Estemirova and Politkovskaya and when it fails to adequately investigate murders that take place. Due to problems within the Russian investigative system, a domestic remedy will not make journalists safer. Improving protection for Russian journalists must come from an international source. The institution with the most potential for effective action is the European Court of Human Rights . Russia is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights , which contains a textual commitment to protect basic, specified human rightsThe Convention sets up the ECHR as a super-national judicial body to prosecute violations by member statesThe next-of-kin of murdered journalists could bring claims against Russia before the ECHR on three grounds: a violation of the journalist's right to life, a failure to comply with a state's duty to protect its citizens, or the failure to effectively investigate the journalist's murder. This Note will begin with statistics about the killing of journalists in Russia. It will then examine the Russian investigations into the murders of Politkovskaya and Estemirova and discuss overall problems with the Russian investigative system. Next, it will consider the international reaction to the journalists' murders. Then it will examine Russia's textual commitments in its domestic constitution and in international documents. Next, it will focus on the ECHR by highlighting the ECHR's structure, its relationship with the Russian government, and prior cases brought before the ECHR that could be relevant to claims brought regarding the killing of Russian journalists. Finally, this Note discusses whether domestic and international pressure could lead Russia to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent future killings of journalists. This Note argues that the best way to effect such change would be to bring cases against Russia before the ECHR for violations of the journalist's right to life, for Russia's failure to protect its citizens, and for inadequate domestic investigations into the murders of journalists. It will analyze the claims that could be presented to the ECHR, assess their potential effectiveness, and discuss the effects such cases, if brought, may have within Russia. It will conclude by noting that true justice is unlikely to occur for Politkovskaya or Estemirova, but that hope remains that the murders of journalists in Russia will become less prevalent, and even cease. An Overview of Journalists and Murder in Russia Unfortunately, the stories of Politkovskaya and Estemirova are not unique, but are only two of the better known examples of journalists murdered in Russia. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Estemirova was the eighteenth journalist murdered in Russia in retaliation for her work between 2000 and 2009In a 2009 report, the same group concluded that Russia is the ""world's third deadliest country for the press and the ninth worst in solving journalist murders.Of the seventeen murders before Estemirova, only one resulted in the killers' conviction and in none of the cases has the person who ordered the killing been brought to justiceFour of the eighteen murdered journalists have worked for Politkovskaya's newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, leading the paper's management to ask the Russian government to allow its reporters to carry guns for protectionThe trend of murders is not solely a result of Putin's time as president and prime minister; rather, as the International Federation of Journalists asserts, between 1993 and 2009, eighty-six ""journalists and media workers have died in Russia because of their work.Furthermore, the Moscow-based Glasnost Foundation documented 1450 instances of intimidation during 2008, including instances in which journalists were beaten or threatened, or where editorial offices were searched or photos confiscatedJournalists in Russia, fearing for their lives, tend to shy away from political or controversial topics Russian President Dmitri Medvedev stated in his 2008 inaugural address that Russian law would be used to secure the safety of citizens. 33 His predecessor, Vladimir Putin, has backtracked from his original statements about Politkovskaya's murder, calling the persecution of journalists ""a very acute problem"" for RussiaDespite the rhetoric from the Kremlin, investigations into murders of less prominent journalists are routinely dismissed for reasons unrelated to their work as journalistsInvestigators often categorize a journalist's murder as an ordinary street crimeAt times they may cite a lack of evidence, or engage in a half-hearted investigation that leads nowhere and, over time, fades into oblivion B. The Investigations into the Deaths of Politkovskaya and Estemirova and the Russian Investigative System 1. The Drawn-Out Investigation into Politkovskaya's Death Three days after Politkovskaya's death, Putin finally commented on her killing; while he called her insignificant, Putin also vowed to do everything he could to bring the perpetrators of her murder to justiceDespite this vow, the investigation became hampered by political infighting within the leaders of Russia's security forcesThe case began under the leadership of Yuri Chaika, the prosecutor general, and was then transferred to an ""investigative committee"" formed with the intent of taking Chaika off the caseA prosecutor named Aleksander Bastrykin led the committee under the watch of Nikolai Patrushev, the director of the Russian security agency, the Federal Security Service Ten months after Politkovskaya's death, officials made their first announcement about the investigation's progressDespite his diminished role in the investigation, Chaika made the announcement, saying that ten people had been arrested for their involvement in the murderIn addition, Chaika accused enemies of the Russian government living abroad of being the masterminds behind the murderHe stated that only people outside the Russian Federation would have had any interest in killing Politkovskaya. 45 He believed these individuals' motivation was to destabilize the country, discredit Russia's leaders, and return Russia ""to the old system, where money and oligarchs ruled.The statement was an indirect reference to exiled billionaire Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch who amassed great wealth during the 1990s, but began to criticize Putin and subsequently fled to London to avoid prosecution for his financial dealings during Russia's formation of a market-based economic system Out of the ten people arrested in connection with Politkovskaya's murder, six were eventually released, three were brought to trial in connection with Politkovskaya's death, and the tenth was accused of other criminal activity but tried in the same trial as the other threeSergey Khadzhikurbanov, one of the suspects tried in connection with Politkovskaya's murder, was a former police investigator who was charged with hiring the killers and providing the weapon used to kill PolitkovskayaThe other two were Chechen brothers, Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov; one accused of driving the car to Politkovskaya's apartment and the other of keeping lookout during the killingA third brother, Rustam, who is believed to be the killer, fled from Russia to Western Europe after it was leaked to the press that there was a warrant out for his arrestReports indicated that Rustam had bribed an immigration official to obtain a fraudulent passport The three men put on trial for Politkovskaya's murder were tried before a jury and acquitted in February 2009In June 2009, the Russian Supreme Court overturned the acquittals and ordered a retrialThe Court stated the retrial was necessary due to procedural violations by the judge and the defense during the first trialOthers outside the courtroom, including President Dmitri Medevdev and lawyers for Politkovskaya's family, cited errors by the prosecution and failures within the jury system as the cause of the retrialThen, in September 2009, the Supreme Court reversed its own ruling, cancelled the retrial, and ordered prosecutors to begin a new investigationIn October 2009, Bastrykin ordered the reopening of investigations into eighteen other unsolved murders of journalistsFinally, in May 2011, investigators arrested Rustam Makhmudov at his parents' home in ChechnyaOfficials stated that he had returned to Chechnya after Russian authorities discovered him in Belgium and began pursuing himHis lawyer countered that Rustam Makhmudov had been trying to turn himself in for some time, but officials previously refused because they did not have enough evidence to prosecute him Those close to Politkovskaya supported the initial murder trial, but viewed the prosecution of Rustam Makhmudov as an attempt to claim justice without punishing anyone of political or social importanceSignifying the lack of trust in officials to effectively prosecute the crime, Novaya Gazeta has been conducting its own investigation into Politkovskaya's murderThey also believe Rustam Makhmudov to be the killer, and were pleased with his arrest;64 however, Politkovskaya's lawyer, Anna Stavitskaya, commented that investigators should not be thanked because the arrest ""should have been done four years "" and reiterated that Russian officials needed to find the mastermind behind Politkovskaya's murder In August 2011, Russian investigators arrested Dmitry Pavluchenkov, a former police lieutenant colonelHe was charged with being paid to organize and oversee the murder, including hiring the murderers and supplying the murder weaponPavluchenkov has reportedly outlined to the prosecutors the preparation and execution of the crimeVladimir Markin, the investigative committee spokesman, said investigators ""have knowledge of the person who likely ordered the crime,"" leading to guarded optimism among Politkovskaya's supporters that further arrests may be made 2. The Mysterious Investigation into Estemirova's Death In contrast with Putin's dismissive comments to Politkovskaya's work as a journalist, following Estemirova's murder President Medvedev noted that her work was ""very useful"" because she ""spoke the truth.He wrote to Memorial, promising that Estemirova's death would be investigated ""in a most careful manner."" 71 In July 2009, President Medvedev appointed Alexander Bastrykin, the man who had led the investigation into Politkovskaya's murder, as the lead prosecutor in the federal investigation of Estemirova's death Many of the facts that have emerged from Estemirova's murder suggest the involvement of Russian or Chechen security forcesOn the drive from Grozny to Ingushetia, the kidnappers had to have passed through several military checkpointsDespite this evidence and Chechnya President Kadyrov's distaste for Estemirova, President Medvedev seemed to rule out any government involvement, calling allegations of official involvement in Estemirova's murder ""primitive and unacceptable. In October 2009, only three months after Estemirova's death, Bastrykin stated that the case was ""on the edge of being solved,"" but never gave any details into his statementIn January 2010, President Kadyrov gave an interview with the Russia Today in which he discussed Estemirova's workHe asserted that the murder was provoked by the same people who killed Politkovskaya, and stated that he was ""absolutely sure that this is Berezovsky's work. In February 2010, an anonymous source contacted the news agency Interfax with a tip that Russian authorities knew the identity of Estemirova's murdererNo further information was given, and in July 2010, President Medvedev said the investigation was continuing and the killer had been established and identifiedInvestigators later revealed that the alleged killer was Alkhazur Bashayev, a member of a rebel group fighting against the Russian army in ChechnyaAuthorities stated that they found the pistol used in the killing when they seized a cache of rebel arms, a car fitting the description of the one used in Estemirova's murder, and a man stating that he sold the car to BashayevBashayev's alleged motivation was revenge against Estemirova for writing reports for Memorial highlighting human rights violations performed by Bashayev's rebel groupOnly one problem remained: Bashayev died in 2009, killed by Russian security forces during a firefight In April 2011, the head of Memorial, Oleg Orlov, stated: ""there is no progress in case.He said the lawyer for Estemirova's family had repeatedly requested that investigators look into links between government officials upset by Estemirova's work as a journalist and her murder, but that investigators refused to pursue those links and refused to provide her family with updated information about the investigationAn investigation conducted by Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, and the International Federation for Human Rights found inconsistencies in the investigation's theory of events; they assert that Bashayev was not the perpetratorThe investigative committee of Russia extended the period of time for the investigation until November 15, 2011 Orlov has consistently asserted that Chechen President Kadyrov is ultimately responsible for ordering Estemirova's murderIn response, Kadyrov sued Orlov for libelIn a civil case, Orlov and Memorial were ordered to pay Kadyrov approximately 70,000 rubles The criminal case, in which Orlov was acquitted in June 2011, had some unusual featuresDespite being the victim of the alleged libel, Kadyrov testified via videoAlso, a main issue in a libel case is determining whether Orlov's accusations were true;94 Orlov presented statements made by Kadyrov and others asserting that Kadyrov controls all of Chechnya and is not afraid to take unlawful actionFinally, Kadyrov's lawyer asked multiple witnesses if they agree with Orlov's view that Kadyrov ordered Estemirova's killing, to which one replied that he believes Kadyrov is one of the suspects 3. Internal Problems Within the Russian Investigative System To fully understand the Russian prosecutorial system, one must consider the history of the rule of law in Russia. Beginning with the unification of Russia by Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century, prosecutors have acted at the behest of the tsarThe Soviet government used the law as a political tool to serve the interests of the Communist PartyIn both Tsarist and Soviet times, security forces persecuted political opponents and the government treated the security forces with impunity The structure of the security organizations in the current Russian Federation is not very different from its Soviet counterpartsOne of the most troubling institutions is the Prokuratura, founded by Peter the Great in 1722The Prokuratura is in charge of conducting investigations and prosecuting crimes, similar to an ""inspector general"" in other systemsTraditionally, the Prokuratura has had vast discretion in its functions, and Russian leaders have relied upon it to conduct investigations of political enemiesIn April 2005, the Venice Commission found that, despite the Prokuratura's investigative powers, it ""remains vulnerable to presidential and other political power.In cases regarding government interests, the Prokuratura continues to represent the ruling elite, acting according to politics, rather than lawIn addition, the Prokuratura's dual role as criminal prosecutors and supervisors of criminal investigations means that any improper actions made during a criminal investigation will be reviewed by the same leaders who oversee the improper actions Members of the Prokuratura led the investigations surrounding Politkovskaya and Estemirova's deaths, which have been fraught with problemsIn Politkovskaya's case, evidence has vanished, including video footage showing the assassin entering Politkovskaya's block and a photo of the man investigators believe pulled the triggerThe footage was eventually found, but then only served to add doubt to the case; for instance, the man seen entering and leaving Politkovskaya's apartment building wore one cap upon entering the building and a different cap upon leaving itIn Estemirova's case, secrecy abounds; no one outside of the government knows whether and when the investigation uncovers any information and investigators give conflicting reports regarding the investigationThe Committee on Investigative Journalists has found similar problems with Russian investigations into the murders of other journalists, including failing to follow leads, failing to question professional contacts of the journalists, concealing important evidence without explanation, and bringing ill-prepared cases to trial C. The Reaction Abroad to the Killing of Journalists The international reaction to the killing of journalists in Russia has largely been limited to comments from government officials and reports by nongovernmental organizations . Prior to a visit to Russia in 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama gave an interview to Novaya Gazeta, and was directly asked whether his desire to ""reset"" the United States' relationship with Russia would require avoiding discussions about Politkovskaya and other journalists' murdersObama said it did not, but provided no explanation, instead commenting vaguely about nuclear weapons, freedom, and human rights Obama made a stronger statement when he called on President Medvedev to follow through on his promise ""to strengthen the rule of law in Russia, which of course includes making sure all those accused of crimes have the right to a fair trial and that the courts are not used for political purposes.In a speech at Moscow State University on October 14, 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the attacks on journalists and human rights defenders in Russia ""a great concern,and, in an earlier meeting with Medvedev, said that she had ""raised the issue of the killing of jour- nalists.In 2011, U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, along with eighteen cosponsors, introduced a bill imposing a visa ban on Russian officials implicated in the deaths of Politkovskaya and Estemirova Some European countries have made similar comments. After the death of Estemirova, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she discussed the topic with Medvedev during bilateral talksMerkel condemned the killing, and Medvedev assured her that everything possible would be done to investigate the crimeGermany has the closest relationship of any Western European country with Russia, and it regularly voices concerns over human rights issues In November 2009, the United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed concern at the ""alarming incidence of threats, violent assaults and murders of journalists and human rights defenders in , which has created a climate of fear and a chilling effect on the media.The Committee stated that it ""regrets the lack of effective measures taken by to protect the right to life and security of these persons.In response to these concerns, the Committee urged Russia to ""nsure the prompt, effective, thorough, independent, and impartial investigation of threats, violent assaults and murders of journalists and . prosecute and institute proceedings against the perpetrators of such acts.The Committee requested that Russia provide it with detailed information regarding the criminal prosecutions of cases involving harm to journalists between 2003 and 2009 NGOs have played a pivotal role in increasing awareness about the killing of journalists in Russia. The Committee to Protect Journalists has issued detailed reports on violence against journalists and has written letters to Russian and international leadersAmnesty International writes an annual report on human rights in RussiaMainstream media sources, such as The New York Times, raise public awareness by continuing to report on the Politkovskaya investigation and the killing of other journalistsOther NGOs pressure government leaders inside and outside of Russia to improve the quality of the investigations into the killing of Russian journalists D. Russia's International and Domestic Textual Commitments Create an Obligation to Protect Journalists Article 46 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation states, ""veryone shall be guaranteed judicial protection of his rights and freedoms.Article 17 holds that individual rights and freedoms are guaranteed ""according to the universally recognized principles and norms of international law and according to the present Constitution.In addition, Russians ""have the right to appeal, according to international treaties of the Russian Federation, to international bodies for the protection of human rights and freedoms, if all the existing internal state means of legal protection have been exhausted.Regarding criminal investigations, Russia's Code of Criminal Procedure provides that ""n every case . revealing the signs of a crime, the prosecutor, the investigator, the body of inquiry and inquirer shall be obligated to take measures . to establish the event of the crime and to expose the person or the persons, guilty of committing the crime. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and signed the Convention in 1998Considering the Convention alongside Russia's commitment to international law in Article 17 of the Russian Constitution, Russia has a binding commitment to follow the ConventionWithin the text of the Convention, Article 1 provides a broad requirement that signatories ""secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms"" granted by the ConventionArticle 2 involves the right to life, stating ""veryone's right to life shall be protected by law.In signing the Convention, Russia made the same textual commitment to the rule of law and the protection of individual rights as the Western European nations in the Council of Europe E. A Forum for Individual Rights: The Structure and Function of the European Court of Human Rights The Convention creates the guidelines for the European Court of Human Rights , which serves as the judicial branch of the ConventionThe ECHR is the largest international court in the world, and signatories to the Convention are bound to accept its judgments, though it does not have the power to change their domestic lawIndividual citizens or member states can file claims before the ECHR against member statesOne judge from each member state is appointed to the ECHR, regardless of the country's sizeA group of seven judges constituting a chamber hears each case, and each chamber includes the judge from the defending member state to provide guidance on issues of domestic law The ECHR does not use a uniform standard of review, though it commonly provides some deference to the defending member stateThe ECHR's remedies are generally limited to declaratory reliefIn limited circumstances, the ECHR has ordered monetary awards for ""just satisfaction,"" though the ECHR lacks clear standards for when to give such awards, and the amounts are generally smallMember states are obligated to carry out the ECHR's judgments, and if the state is recalcitrant, the duty falls upon the Council of Europe to obtain compliance The ECHR revised its structure in 1998, improving its effectiveness in resolving disputesRegardless, a backlog has developed, and Russian cases are a main contributorAs of December 2010, Russian cases accounted for almost 29% of cases pending before the ECHR-40,000 cases in totalRussia has the largest population of any member state, with a population of approximately 140 million, but dysfunction within Russia's legal system has also led to the large number of claims In 2004, the ECHR introduced Protocol 14, allowing single judges to adjudicate some claims that fail threshold questions, modifying judges' terms, and streamlining ""repetitive"" claimsThe reforms aimed to improve the ECHR's efficiency and allow the adjudication of more claimsRussia believed that the changes would adversely affect its interests in cases where it is the defendant, especially with respect to ""repetitive"" claimsAfter five years of being the only country not to ratify Protocol 14, Russia signed it in January 2010 Many commentators have discussed the positive effects of Russian membership in the Council of Europe from a legal perspective. 155 To become a member of the Council of Europe, Russia had to institute reforms to its legal systemPresident Medvedev has stated that the Russian justice system ""must be effective enough to bring appeals to international courts to a minimum.In 2008, President Medvedev proposed reforms to improve the appointment and supervision of judges with the goal of reducing the number of appeals before the ECHROne of the indisputable functions of the ECHR is to encourage, and sometimes force, nations such as Russia, who do not have a strong tradition or practice in the rule of law and human rights, to improve their standards to more closely resemble those of Western European nations F. Cases Heard by the European Court of Human Rights Under Article 2 Right to Life, Article 1 Security of Rights and Freedoms, and Article 3 Prohibition Against Torture 1. Article 2 Right to Life Enforced Disappearances Cases Since the 1990's, Chechnya, a quasi-independent region within the Russian Federation, has descended into chaos due to a violent struggle between the Russian army and Chechen rebelsCorruption and human rights abuses in Chechnya were a main topic for both Politkovskaya and EstemirovaOne of the most troubling developments in Chechnya is the prevalence of enforced disappearances where victims are kidnapped or killed by state agents or members of armed groupsThe rule of law is not effective in Chechnya, and President Kadyrov rules the region like a military dictatorshipThe Russian legal system has ignored enforced disappearances, and so the task of adjudicating them has largely fallen to the ECHRAs of November 2008, the ECHR had issued ""twenty-eight judgments finding Russia responsible for enforced disappearances of its citizens. Enforced disappearances cases have been brought under Article 2 of the Convention, which guarantees all individuals a right to lifeIn the cases before the ECHR, the primary issue is whether the applicant can show that the Russian government, and not a private party, was responsible for the deathIn Bazorkina v. Russia, the applicant's son was taken into custody and subsequently disappeared; an investigation uncovered no information regarding his whereaboutsThe ECHR was certain that the victim was in Russian custody because a CNN broadcast team embedded with the Russian military had filmed the victim in detention and showed a Russian general ordering his executionThe ECHR presumed the victim to be dead and held Russia responsible because Russia could offer no explanation for what had happened to the victim In other cases, the parties dispute whether government security forces or other individuals abducted the victimIn Umarov v. Russia, the ECHR found that Russia was responsible for the missing individual's abduction, relying on evidence that the kidnappers wore uniforms similar to Russian military personnel, had military vehicles, and were able to pass freely through military roadblocks. 172 In addition to the government's investigative files, the ECHR refers to eyewitness testimony for evidence regarding the abductors' appearance and actions In some cases, the ECHR has emphasized the failure of the Russian government to provide information obtained during the Russian government's investigation to the ECHRIn Imakayeva v. Russia, the ECHR made at least four requests that the Russian government produce the criminal investigation file that the ECHR believed contained facts crucial to the caseRussia never produced the documentsWhen the government does not submit the relevant documentation, it is difficult for the applicant to pre- sent enough evidence to support the allegationsIn Imakayeva and other cases, the ECHR has drawn factual inferences against the government where it is unable to obtain enough facts to conduct a meaningful review The continuing flow of enforced disappearance cases before the ECHR shows that Russia's legislative and administrative reforms have had little effect on the military culture in Chechnya causing the enforced disappearancesWhile Russia consistently pays out any monetary amount ordered by the ECHR, it has refused to make policy and legal changes that will prevent similar events from taking placeOf the thirty-three ECHR judgments against Russia regarding Chechnya, not one perpetrator has been convicted after a ruling, even in cases where the ECHR judgment names the perpetrator 2. Article 2 as a Positive Duty to Protect and Read in Conjunction with Article 1's General Security to Rights and Freedoms The ECHR has interpreted Article 2, section 1 of the Convention as requiring that a country ""not only . refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction.Many Article 2 cases have originated in TurkeyLike Russia, Turkey has a weaker record on human rights than Western European nations and defends a large proportion of ECHR claimsIn Kaya v. Turkey, Kaya, a doctor who was treating members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party , was murdered in southeast Turkey, an area known to be dangerous for members of the PKKThe ECHR found that although no state actor was responsible for the murder, Turkey had failed its duty to take reasonable measures to prevent a real and immediate risk to Kaya's lifeThe ECHR found that Turkey was aware that Kaya was in danger, and that deficiencies in Turkey's legal system and its acquiescence in allowing paramilitary groups to operate in the region had undermined Kaya's protection under the lawAccording to the ECHR, the duty to protect under Article 2 necessitates ""putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. Investigation Requirements in Article 2 and Article 3 Cases Article 2, when read in conjunction with the state's general duty under Article 1's requirement to ""secure to everyone within jurisdiction the rights and freedoms"" of the Convention, requires ""some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed.Originally, the ECHR only extended the duty to investigate when individuals had been killed ""as a result of the use of force by . agents of the state.However, in Tanrikulu v. Turkey, the ECHR extended the duty to investigate to cases where it had not been established that state agents caused the killing The ECHR has applied the same requirement of an effective investigation under Article 2 claims to claims of torture under Article 3It has held that there cannot be a hierarchical or institutional connection between suspected offenders and those who investigate themInvestigators cannot be considered effective without a level of independence, not just in institutional terms, but also in practical termsFor example, in Ergi v. Turkey, an alleged clash between security forces and the PKK resulted in the death of a girl; the ECHR held that the investigators were not independent because their investigation relied heavily on information provided by the same members of the security forces implicated in the incident In Assenov v. Bulgaria, a fourteen-year-old boy alleged that officers assaulted him while he was in custodyThe ECHR required that the authorities make a serious attempt to ascertain the facts before making decisions or closing an investigationThe investigators in Assenov did not meet the ECHR's requirements because authorities made a determination that a non-state actor caused Assenov's injuries without having sufficient knowledge or evidence of the perpetrator's identityThe ECHR focused on omissions in the investigation that, if filled, could have provided information to help Assenov make a claim against the state In Mikheyev v. Russia, a suspect in custody was allegedly beaten while being questioned and subsequently jumped out of a window when threatened with further physical punishment, sustaining serious injuriesThe applicant made claims before the ECHR of torture and inadequacy of investigationRussia refused to submit its investigative file to the ECHRThis left gaps in the facts of the case, which the ECHR filled with inferences drawn from the refusal to submit the investigative fileUsing these inferences and considering that the investigation took seven years and was opened and re-opened fifteen times, the ECHR held that Russia had violated Article 3 based on the ineffective investigation These cases demonstrate that a state can be responsible when state actors abduct and harm a citizen because a state has a positive duty to protect its citizens by responding to violence and maintaining effective criminal laws. When a right is violated, a state has the duty to effectively investigate the allegations. The Potential for Forces Inside Russia to Effect Change The Russian Constitution's textual commitment to the rule of law is strong, but the operation of the rule of law in Russia is much weakerAn essential part of a democratic, free-market system is a press willing and able to challenge those in power and expose abuses of the law. The killing of journalists has created a chilling effect that is preventing Russia from developing a vigorous pressJournalists are frightened to examine potentially controversial topics because of the risk to their physical safetyThe manner in which journalists comply with the demands of government and business leaders greatly resembles the traditional Russian system of state-controlled information rather than a democratic, free-market system208. The investigation into Politkovskaya's death shows the inadequacy of the Russian prosecutorial system to punish those who murder journalists. The impunity for those who ordered the murders means that the killings will continue until investigations improve and the true perpetrators are brought to justice. Russia has shown that its domestic institutions lack the strength to effectively prosecute the crimes. Its investigative system is ineffective due to the prevalence of the Prokuratura, its failure to effectively investigate claims, and infighting among its leadersIn Politkovskaya's case, prosecutions were brought to trial but the inadequate investigation made it impossible to convict the defendantsFor Estemirova, the investigation drags on with no signs of progress Russia's political leaders have the power to ensure an effective investigation, but lack the will to ensure those responsible are arrestedPresident Medvedev has spoken more passionately than Putin about solving journalist's murdersHowever, his words have not led to more effective action and Putin is all but assured of resuming the presidency in 2012Russia's business elite will not push for change, as many of the journalists who have been harmed have targeted the elites in their reports; thus they benefit from their deaths Russia's lack of tradition in the rule of law should not be underemphasized. A textual commitment to the rule of law has been in place in Russia for fewer than twenty years, and one commentator has argued that ""he injection of modern, Western European human rights norms, therefore, cannot 'fix' Russia overnight.The fragility of the Russian legal tradition underlines the importance of keeping Russia as a member of the ECHR-a group dominated by states with liberal democratic values B. The Potential for the International Community to Effect Change Based on the lack of political and societal will within Russia to protect journalists, Russia is unlikely to change its actions without significant pressure from outside the country. Western governments have many political disagreements with Russia that require political capital with the KremlinThe United States and European countries, such as Germany, have chosen to focus on issues other than human rights in their political dealings with RussiaThis lack of external pressure is unfortunate because Russia's textual commitments to the protection of human rights are similar to those of Western European nationsIf Western nations emphasized human rights in meetings with Russia, they could highlight the differences between their countries' respect for human rights and Russia's, in an attempt to convince Russia to change. NGOs have the power to increase awareness about the murder of journalists through reports, articles, and press releases. Without any subsequent pressure from other governments or intergovernmental organizations, however, Russia will not have an incentive to provide more protection for journalists Given Western nations' focus on issues other than the killing of journalists and the inability of NGOs to pressure Russia to protect journalists, intergovernmental organizations provide the best opportunity to compel change. The United Nations is too large an organization to focus on the murders of journalists within one nation and it is not structured to deal with countries' domestic issuesIn contrast, the Council of Europe was designed to be a collection of member states and the ECHR was founded specifically to review and enforce domestic legal claims under the Convention. 223 Russia has shown a commitment to the procedures and findings of the ECHR, and the Convention holds its members to the standards of Western, liberal democraciesIf any international organization can compel Russia to prosecute those responsible for the killings of journalists, the ECHR is best-suited to do so. The Plan for Claims of Russian Journalists in the ECHR 1. The Basis for the Claims Applications to the ECHR must be submitted by the next-of-kin of a murder victim,225 which, in the case of the Russian journalists discussed above, would be Politkovskaya's son and Estemirova's daughter. The applicants have many potential claims under the Convention. First, they could claim that state actors were involved in the murders, and therefore, Russia violated the journalists' right to life. Second, they could argue that even if state actors were not involved in the murders, Russia failed its positive duty to protect the journalists from harm. Finally, they could argue that Russia failed in its duty to effectively investigate the murders. Violation of Article 2 Right to Life Under Article 2, the applicants could bring evidence that state actors were responsible for the journalists' murder. Estemirova's daughter would be more likely to succeed under this claim because her mother's murder was similar to other enforced disappearances in which the ECHR has found Russia responsible. Unlike in Bazorkina, where videotapes showed the victim under the control of the Russian military, there is no direct evidence that Estemirova was under state control at the time of her deathThe argument in Estemirova's case would be more similar to the one made in Umarov, where witnesses presented testimony that the abductors looked and acted like Russian soldiersIn Umarov, the abductors wore military uniforms and drove military vehicles; in contrast, Estemirova's abductors did not wear military uniforms and pushed her into a personal carHowever, like in Umarov, Estemirova's abductors passed freely through military checkpoints while the victim was in the car-suggesting compliance, if not direct participation- of officials in her murderIn addition, the applicant in Estemirova's case could argue that the Russian military has kidnapped and killed other individuals in a similar mannerIn addition, Estemirova was killed in an execution style, which would suggest military involvement The known evidence in Politkovskaya's murder points away from state action in her assassination, but the possibility remains that state actors ordered her killing. No evidence exists that state actors have previously assassinated civilians in Moscow and the man believed to have actually murdered Politkovskaya was Chechen, not RussianNo tangible evidence supports the assertion that state officials ordered her killing, and the accusation that a government murdered its own citizen is a difficult argument to make. Violation of the Duty to Protect Citizens from Harm Even if state actors did not kill Politkovskaya or Estemirova, both women have a valid claim that Russia failed its duty to protect its citizens by failing to appropriately safeguard their lives. Both the journalists themselves and state officials were aware of the danger to each woman, much like the danger to the victim in Kaya v. 233 In Kaya, Turkey was aware that murders of PKK members in that particular region had occurred in the pastSimilarly, the frequency of journalists' murders in Russia is widely known by the Russian government, and both women worked on sensitive topics that displeased powerful people In Kaya, the ECHR pointed to deficiencies within Turkey's criminal law system that undermined the protection to the victim provided by the lawsThe applicants for Estemirova and Politkovskaya could argue that Russia has failed the ECHR's requirement, as described in Kaya, that laws protecting citizens must be supported with ""law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment"" of the loss of lifeThe Russian government has encouraged a hostile culture for journalists. 238 In Russia, independent journalists such as Politkovskaya and Estemirova are criticized not just by private individuals, but also by government officialsIn addition, the impunity for past murderers of journalists shows future actors that there is a minimal likelihood of being punished for the murder of an unpopular journalist. 240 The culture in Russia makes it dangerous for independent journalists such as Estemirova and Politkovskaya to operate. Without providing adequate protection from the government, Russia has violated its affirmative duty to protect its citizens. Violation of the Duty to Investigate The applicants for Politkovskaya and Estemirova should focus on the claim that the investigations into the murders of the two women were inadequate. The claim should assert that the ineffectiveness of the investigations made the prosecution of the individuals responsible impossible. Under the standard set in to Tanrikulu v. Turkey, Russian authorities have an obligation to conduct an investigation into any murder within RussiaThe applicant in Politkovskaya's case has a stronger claim than the applicant for Estemirova, as Politkovskaya's investigation is older and has had more problemsHowever, Estemirova's investigation has also shown signs of ineffectiveness In both cases, the applicant could argue that the structure of the Russian investigative system has prevented the investigation from being adequate. Turkey, the ECHR held that investigators must not have an institutional connection to those they are investigating and must also be independent in practical termsThe institutional structure of the Prokuratura undermines the independence of Russian investigations both institutionally and practically. 245 The Prokuratura routinely take into account political considerations in high profile casesIn addition, if a state actor were involved in the murder, the Prokuratura would be investigating its peers within the Russian security forcesTherefore, an adequate investigation into the potential actions of security forces is unlikely to occur, and the applicants in both cases could argue that this prevents an effective investigation where there is potential for state action. In bringing a claim for lack of effective investigation, the applicant in Politkovskaya's case could point out the many problems with the investigationFirst, authorities leaked the identity of the killer causing him to flee from RussiaWhile he has since been arrested, it remains to be seen if he will be convicted. Russia, the ECHR found the difficulties associated with a seven year investigation that had been closed and re-opened fifteen times a contributing factor to the finding of an ineffective investigationSimilarly, authorities continue to investigate Politkovskaya's case more than four years after her murder and have closed and re-opened the case multiple timesInconsisten- cies remain in the investigator's factual assertions, as evidenced in the mistrial Also contributing to the ineffectiveness of the investigation into Politkovskaya's murder is the lack of pursuit of the person or group who ordered the killingThe Bulgarian authorities in Assenov determined that a non-state actor caused Assenov's injuries without learning all the facts about the incident or the identity of the perpetrator. 254 In Politkovskaya's case, the Russian authorities have been quick to jump to conclusions and arrest individuals without first determining the mastermind behind the crimeThe applicant in Politkovskaya's case has a strong claim for an inadequate investigation based on the Russian authorities' mistakes and the remaining unanswered questions. As time elapses with no progress, the likelihood increases that the investigation into Estemirova's death would also be found ineffective. A key investigator stated soon after the murder that the case was almost solved, but made no follow-up statements about what information he had obtainedAnother investigator, Igor Sobol, stated that authorities knew the identity of the killer, only to be contradicted by othersIn making his claim, Sobol may have had a similar mindset to the authorities in Assenov, and was committed to ruling out any involvement by state actors despite a lack of sufficient knowledge about who actually committed the crimeRussian investigators have the opportunity to conduct an effective investigation into Estemirova's murder, but it appears the investigation will suffer enough problems to submit a claim of ineffectiveness before the ECHR. An Unknown: The Investigative File An uncertainty in the adjudication of the journalists' claims is whether the Russian government would produce its investigative files for ECHR review. Russia withheld its investigative files in many of the prior Chechen disappearance cases, drawing the disapproval of the ECHRThe Russian government is in a difficult position. If it submits the files, it brings to light any mistakes or omissions made during the investigation. If it fails to disclose the files, the ECHR will make adverse inferences against it regarding the quality of the investigation, and any evidence the applicants present regarding the investigation will be largely without rebuttal. In Politkovskaya's case, the closing and reopening of the investigation multiple times has most likely led to inconsistencies and gaps in the reports, which the applicant could highlight if the Russian authorities submit the investigative files. It is unclear how the ECHR would handle the Prokuratura's reports in an Article 2 case coming from a part of Russia other than Chechnya, as most such cases have been brought under Article 6 , Article 10 , or Article 3 Applications to the ECHR regarding the killing of Politkovskaya and Estemirova may very well be successful. The ECHR has shown a willingness to enforce the liberal ideals embodied in the Convention against member states whose actual commitment to human rights has not matched the textual commitments they made in signing the Convention. Given the ECHR's rulings against Russia in enforced disappearance claims from Chechnya, it is likely to make rulings against Russia regarding the murdering of the journalists. 261 Politkovskaya's claim is most likely to succeed on a claim of inadequate investigation, while Estemirova best argument is that state actors violated her right to life. Both women's next of kin could also be successful pursuing a claim that Russia violated its duty to protect its citizens. The Likely Effect Within Russia of an Adverse Result 1. Russia's Psychological Reaction The ECHR has had an effect on Russian domestic politics and law. Any ECHR verdict is legally binding on RussiaRussia has paid every judgment assessed against it, and honors the ECHR's proceduresRussia has shown that it is concerned about the number of cases it defends before the ECHR264 and the threat of more cases against Russia before the ECHR will pressure Russia to uphold the rule of law. Therefore, an adverse ruling against Russia in an ECHR case will likely affect Russia's attention to the murder of journalists. Though the degree of the effect may be small, it will be more than that from the current external pressures on Russia. If one journalist's claim were successful, many more such claims would likely be filed against Russia. Russia might become concerned that an avalanche of cases regarding murdered journalists would occur-similar to the onslaught of enforced disappearances cases. President Medvedev has repeatedly voiced his desire to lower the number of cases filed against Russia in the ECHRIn addition, Russia might dislike the international media attention resulting from an adverse ruling in a high-profile case such as Politkovskaya's. The higher the profile of the murdered journalist who is the subject of the first claim, the greater the effect may be on Russia. As one commentator has noted, ""shaming effects have a surprising power on states. The Effect on Future Investigations With the potential for the ECHR to analyze Russia's actions, Russia might conduct a more thorough investigation when a journalist is killed. It might pursue both the killer and the person who ordered the killing more vigorously; if for no other reason than to be able to argue before the ECHR that its investigation was adequate. However, if speculation is correct that state officials are often involved in the killing of journalists, then improved investigations are unlikely because of the investigators' desire to protect other state officials. The Russian government's desire to avoid ECHR claims may make Russian officials reconsider if indeed they order such killings. Major change inside Chechnya is unlikely; the many ECHR rulings in enforced disappearances cases have had little effect on the situation there. To the extent that Chechen officials are involved in the killing of journalists outside of Chechnya, the Russian government might order them to stop such actions. Another potential outcome is that Russia would stop following ECHR decisionsWhile this outcome is undesirable, it would force the members of the Council of Europe to consider pressing Russia on human rights issues. On the other hand, members might choose to ignore Russia's flouting of the ECHR's rulings, leaving Russia with no motivation to improve its investigative system. CONCLUSION The violence surrounding journalists in Russia is discouraging to the international community. Given Russia's history of suppression of free speech, along with the immense power still concentrated in the Kremlin, the possibility of change seems remote. As Estemirova commented about the investigation into Politkovskaya's murder, ""ven if we find out who pulled the trigger, the person who gave the order will remain unknown.Sadly, this acknowledgement now applies to Estemirova as well. Even if the ECHR hears claims regarding the murder of Politkovskaya, Estemirova, or other journalists, it is unlikely that those who ordered the killings will be brought to justice. Hope lies in the prevention of future killings of journalists and in the possibility that Russian officials and investigators might alter their behavior if they know their actions will be analyzed in an international court of law. The broader hope is in the continued integration of Russia into international and European organizations, where it can be held to the same standards as Western European nations. Despite this hope, Russia's transition toward the rule of law will take time. Meanwhile, Russian journalists are paying the price."

Page 4 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Executive Summary The latest Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report from BMI forecasts that the country will account for 2% of Central and Eastern European regional oil demand by 2015, while providing 2% of supply. CEE regional oil use of 5mn b/d in 2001 rose to an estimated 6mn b/d in 2010. It should increase to around 6mn b/d by 2015. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001 and in 2010 averaged an estimated 13mn b/d. It is set to rise to 15mn b/d by 2015. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total rose to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 8mn b/d by 2015. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the most important exporter. In terms of natural gas, the region in 2010 consumed an estimated 637bcm, with demand of 737bcm targeted for 2015, representing 15% growth. Production of an estimated 773bcm in 2010 should reach 963bcm in 2015, which implies net exports rising from an estimated 136bcm in 2010 to 2,26bcm by the end of the period. Turkmenistans share of consumption in 2010 was an estimated 3%, while its share of production is put at 5%. By 2015, its share of demand is forecast to be 4%, with the country accounting for 9% of supply. Domestic consumption trends can be expected to return to a strong growth tack from 2010 onwards, estimated at an average of 5% per annum. By 2015, the country could be using 160,000b/d of oil. Turkmenistan has traditionally been protective of its onshore basins, allowing international oil companies to participate only in offshore developments. Offshore activity should help raise national crude and gas liquids output from an estimated 216,000b/d in 2010 to 375,000b/d by 2015. Gas production is expected to increase from an estimated 42bcm to 90bcm between 2010 and 2015. Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 56%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d at the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption is set to increase by 62% between 2010 and 2020, with growth of 5% per annum and the country using 204,000b/d by 2020. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 42bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 20bcm to 95bcm. Turkmenistan shares 11th place with Uzbekistan in BMIs composite Business Environment Ratings, which combines upstream and downstream scores. It shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the ratings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in joint 10th place, alongside Slovenia. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Political SWOT Strengths Common strategic interests will smooth regional relations with Turkmenistan's energy-hungry neighbours such as China, and possibly even the EU. Weaknesses Despite growing discontent over increased repression and corruption, there is little prospect of an organised opposition gaining a foothold. Harsh methods will be used to suppress public protest, and multimillion-dollar contracts signed with Western companies will mute business support. Opportunities The stable transition of power after Saparmurat Niyazov's death is a positive sign of political stability. President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedovs policies indicate that he may be willing to forge greater trade and business links with foreign countries. Threats Turkmenistan will remain one of the world's most restrictive societies, and with few of the benefits from increased hydrocarbon sales reaching the population, there remains some risk of civil uprising. Turkmenistan Economic SWOT Strengths Economic activity will be supported by the ongoing expansion of energy production and exports, ensuring strong growth in the medium term. Weaknesses The official economic figures remain unreliable, reflecting the legacy of the Soviet era when only 'positive data' were released. With fiscal management opaque, international financial institutions will continue to find it hard to analyse and support Turkmenistan's economic development. The persistence of central planning, with government use of production targets and mandatory state procurement, will prevent efficient resource allocation, risking shortages of consumer goods, inflationary pressure and stunted growth. Opportunities The gas pipeline to China, the first section of which came onstream in December 2009, helps diversify the country's export markets. Moreover, the country is also considering diversifying its gas export routes to Europe, bypassing Russia. The trade surplus provides an opportunity for the government to diversify the economy. Threats Trade levels will continue to fluctuate greatly while gas markets remain vulnerable to interruptions in pipeline access and external shocks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Turkmenistan Business Environment SWOT Strengths Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 216,000b/d in 2010. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm, ranking it among the worlds top five countries. Weaknesses All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow have soured, following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan. Opportunities Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC- friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. The country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Threats Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Turkmenistan Energy Market Overview Once-isolationist Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners, but some have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. However, in March 2011, the countrys Energy Ministry, cited by Reuters, announced that it would not invite foreign oil companies to explore its onshore gas fields, although they would be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. Foreign companies exploration will therefore be limited to Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya Basin in the east, and the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian Basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. The revision puts reserve estimates above the high estimate made by UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates when it conducted the first independent assessment of the field in October 2008. GCA put the field's low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to its export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. We expect production volumes to have picked up only slightly to around 42bcm in 2010. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. However, Turkmenistan has been pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009/2010 it inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The inauguration of the China pipeline in December 2009 marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's northwestern Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online reporting that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger has said that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Speaking to a think-tank conference in Brussels in January 2011, Oettinger said that the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev was prepared to sell 18-21bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor. Azerbaijan could start gas exports to the EU in 2016-2019, according to the Knight Ridder news agency. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell another 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. The Southern Corridor project aims to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas imports by establishing a direct route to import gas from the Caspian region. The main component of the project is the Nabucco pipeline, which is aimed at transporting gas from Central Asia or the Middle East via Turkey into Europe. From Turkey, the corridor extends to include the planned Trans-Adriatic Pipeline project and the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline, as well as the proposed White Stream pipeline. Nabucco has stalled because of an inability to secure sufficient quantities of feedstock gas. Russia has signed an agreement with Afghanistan to help build the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. The proposed US$4bn TAPI pipeline would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to India, which joined the project in 2008. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan would receive 1bcm per year from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 5bcm per year afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 216,000b/d in 2010. The government targets higher production, but the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals because of a shifting interest to gas production and lagging foreign investment. The country exports around half of its production. Local demand is estimated at 125,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. In February 2008, the president introduced a new fuels retail system providing transportation customers with free gasoline up to a specified level and charging a market rate, established by the state, for amounts exceeding the quota. Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energyis now owned by Italys Eni group. Turkmenistan is set to open development of its offshore Caspian oil deposits to US majors for the first time. Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov in August 2010 selected US majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips as well as US-based TX Oil and Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Oil and Gas to develop blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian Sea, according to Reuters quoting state television. Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . A third 50,000b/d refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Regional Energy Market Overview Although Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the decade but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Russias gas deposits not only dominate regional supply but are also the biggest single source for Western Europe. While consumer countries wish to diversify away from Russia, there are no other regional suppliers of note. LNG is not a major trade for the CEE region, although Russia began exporting gas in March 2009 from the Far Eastern Sakhalin projects into the Asia Pacific markets. Russian 2009/10 production surprised on the upside, with output fighting back after tax adjustments were introduced and modified. The countrys supply had fallen in 2008, ending a strong growth trend that began in 2000. We see little risk of a downturn in 2011, but 2011/12 could emerge as the near-term peak in output. A decline below 10mn b/d is thought likely in 2013, before increased investment delivers extra volumes of Russian crude and supply rises towards 10mn b/d in 2015 and to 11mn b/d by 2016/2017. The other regional theme is the Caspian states and their ability to meet production and export targets. The ultimate long-term potential is in little doubt, but a mixture of technical, commercial and political factors looks set hold back the rate of supply expansion. In 2009/10, the previously expected strong growth in output evaporated in the wake of persistent technical and commercial problems. Azerbaijan has some near-term upside. Kazakhstans near-term output growth potential is limited thanks to technical problems and the Kashagan field dispute, but longer-term prospects are good once Kashagan becomes a major contributor. CEE oil production averaged an estimated 13mn b/d in 2010. The region's output is expected to be 13mn b/d in 2011 and to reach 15mn b/d by 2015. In terms of demand, the estimated 2010 average of 6mn b/d is set to rise to 6mn b/d by 2015. This means that net exports from the region will climb steadily, from an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 to 8mn b/d by 2015.

It is set to rise to 15mn b/d by 2015. Turkmenistans share of 2010 oil production was 1%, rising to 2% in 2015. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total rose to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 8mn b/d by 2015.

Land boundaries mean pipeline transportation of gas is the favoured option, particularly from Russia through the CEE region into Western Europe. However, Russia became an LNG exporter in 2009 as Gazprom/Shells Sakhalin-II project entered production. Also, Poland is planning medium- to long-term LNG imports as a means of diversifying supply away from Russia, while proposals are being discussed for a Croatian LNG terminal on the Adriatic coast, with imports possible by 2017. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 18 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Business Environment Ratings Central/Eastern Europe Region The CEE region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime. The political and economic environment varies, depending partly on market maturity and EU membership. Russia and the Caspian states are viewed as more volatile and less stable than the recent EU entrants. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Composite Scores Composite Business Environment scores are calculated using the average of individual upstream and downstream ratings. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan continue to dominate the top of the regional league table, taking first and second places with respective scores of 59and 58 points out of a possible 100. Slovenia takes the final place in the rankings, with a composite upstream and downstream score of 41 points out of the 100 available. The points spread in the CEE region is considerably narrower than elsewhere, with the lowest-ranked country having 69% of the score allocated to the highest-ranked. Russia holds fifth place below Poland and Turkey, with a medium-term chance of catching those immediately above, but little hope of challenging the two leading Central Asian energy powerhouse states. Turkey is likely to remain in a close fight with Poland for position, while Romania and Ukraine are closely matched just above the middle of the league table, ahead of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria with their limited upstream resource potential. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are tied near the bottom and have the potential to challenge the trio immediately above them. Croatia and Slovakia are struggling to keep clear of Slovenia in last place.

In turn, the Rewards Rating comprises Industry Rewards and Country Rewards, which have a 75% and 25% weighting respectively. They are based upon the oil and gas resource base/growth outlook and sector maturity and the broader industry competitive environment . The Risks rating comprises Industry Risks and Country Risks which have a 65% and 35% weighting respectively and are based on a subjective evaluation of licensing terms and liberalisation and the industrys broader Country Risks exposure , which is based on BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings. The ratings structure is aligned across the 14 Industries for which BMI provides Business Environment Ratings methodology, and is designed to enable clients to consider each rating individually or as a composite, with the choice depending on their exposure to the industry in each particular state.

Industry Rewards Industry Risks Country Rewards Rewards Country Risks Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream Business Environment ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Industry Rewards: On the basis of upstream data alone, Turkmenistan is actually the second most attractive state in the CEE region, behind only Kazakhstan. This reflects the fourth- and second-placed oil and gas reserves, the third-ranked oil production growth outlook, and fourth-placed gas production prospects. Country Rewards: Contributing to Turkmenistans third highest position in the Rewards section is its unenviable country rewards rating, which takes 13th place ahead only of Uzbekistan and Russia. The state has greater ownership of upstream assets than many in the region, and the industry is only somewhat competitive, with few non-state companies operational. Industry Risks: Turkmenistan is ranked second from last, ahead only of Russia, in the Risks section of our ratings. Its joint 13th position for industry risks with Slovenia is due to its licensing environment, and the fact that there is little immediate chance of privatisation of state-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is the second least attractive in the region, ranked 14th ahead only of Uzbekistan. The best, and only respectable, score is for long-term policy continuity. Corruption is the key risk for private companies. Furthermore, their ability to operate is weakened by the countrys low-scoring physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Downstream Scores Russia/Turkey and Croatia now bracket the remaining 12 CEE states in the downstream rankings, with Turkey having again caught Russia, in spite of the size of Russias fuels market and refining capacity etc. Turkeys risk profile is substantially better and it may be able to retain a share of regional leadership over the medium term. Poland is now holding third place and is also a potential regional leader. Ukraine is now two points behind Poland, and is unlikely to challenge it during the next few quarters. Romania has overtaken the Czech Republic to take fifth place. Turkmenistan has remained clear of Uzbekistan, with the latter still tied with Bulgaria. Slovakia is just a point clear of Croatia at the foot of the table.

For a list of the data/indicators used, please consult the appendix. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in joint 10th place, alongside Slovenia. Industry Rewards: On the basis of downstream data alone, Turkmenistan ranks sixth above Romania among the regions 15 countries. This is attributable to the countrys ninth highest refining capacity, second highest gas demand growth outlook and joint third highest oil demand growth ranking. Country Rewards: Turkmenistan ranks eighth in terms of the Rewards section, although its country rewards rating holds last place in the region, behind even Uzbekistan and Slovenia. Growth in GDP per capita is the fifth highest for the entire region. Population ranks 11th and nominal GDP is the lowest in the region. Industry Risks: In the Risks section of our ratings, Turkmenistan is ranked 12th, just ahead of Ukraine. Its equal 11th place with Uzbekistan for industry risks reflects the challenging regulatory regime and the fact that there is little chance of near-term privatisation of government-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is ranked 13th, ahead only of Turkey and Ukraine. The scores for short-term policy continuity, short-term economic external risk and short-term economic growth risk are relatively high, but the country is let down by very low scores for legal framework, rule of law and physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Risk Summary Political President Berdymukhamedov has once again stated his openness to the formation of opposition parties, whilst speaking to parliament on January 20 2011, echoing previous speeches in 2010. While the president has ostensibly embarked on a programme of economic and political liberalisation after taking over power four years ago, the country's political system remains authoritarian in nature, with Berdymukhamedov maintaining a close grip on the legislative and judicial branches of government. Ultimately, despite continued overtures to further political liberalisation, we do not expect the political environment to change considerably in the near future. According to a government official, Japan has agreed to help finance the construction of a US$1bn chemical plant in the ex-Soviet nation, which will help to produce much-needed fertilizers for the country's cotton crops. The majority of the funding from Japan will reportedly come from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the plant is expected to become operational by 2014. Despite its extensive development of domestic gas reserves over the past two years, Turkmenistan will remain a major cotton producer in the region for the foreseeable future, in our view. According to the Turkmen foreign ministry, Turkmenistan is reportedly set to begin construction on a new power line in the next two months to Afghanistan that will increase energy exports to the war-torn country by a factor of five. The project is not expected to be completed until late 2013 and will cost just less than US$400mn, but will also potentially also allow the export of electricity to be increased towards Pakistan and Tajikistan. Economic Business Environment Business Monitor International Ltd Page 25 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Industry Forecast Scenario Oil And Gas Reserves Turkmenistan claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. We are assuming no dramatic change in proven reserves even as production rises, with around 570mn bbl remaining by 2014/15. All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. We are forecasting an increase in gas reserves to at least 10,000bcm during the forecast period. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. State-run China National Petroleum Corporation made a major gas discovery in late-2009 at the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, which the company has said could hold more than 100bcm of reserves. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 26 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, but rebounded to an estimated 216,000b/d in 2010. The government is targeting higherproduction, but the oil sector is strugglingto meet its growth goals owing to ashifting interest to gas production andlagging foreign investment. According toreports in 2007, Turkmenistan aimed toproduce 2mn b/d by 2030. Although this target has been reduced to 1mn b/d by 2030, according to an unnamed source speaking to Reuters in March 2011, we still see the new output target as rather optimistic. BMI forecasts 2011 oil production averaging 235,000b/d, rising to 375,000b/d by 2015. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand is an estimated 125,000b/d in 2010 and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI forecasts demand to increase from an estimated 125,000b/d to 160,000b/d by 2015, leaving export potential of up to 215,000b/d. Consultant GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum productive capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. While GCA has not commented on how quickly the field could be brought on stream, the suggested output levels would significantly add to the countrys production volumes. UK-based services firm Petrofac has begun work on the second phase of the South Yolotan scheme. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the US$3bn phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. It will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. Turkmenistan Oil Production, Consumption And Exports e/f = estimate/forecast. Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecasts BMI Gas Supply And Demand Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Remarks by a Turkmen energy official suggest that Petronas's Block-1 could have started exporting gas by early-2011, with an anonymous source claimingRussia could be the export destination.The head of Turkmenistan's State Agency on Management of HydrocarbonResources, Yagshigeldy Kakayev, said that production would reach 5bcm per year during the first phase of development, rising to 10bcm at an unspecified date. He said the gas would be exported, but did not say what the destination would be. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to its export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. We expect production volumes to have picked up only slightly to around 42bcm in 2010. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 42bcm in 2010 to 90bcm by 2014/15, with growth continuing beyond this point as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 22bcm to 31bcm during the period, so exports could reach 58bcm by 2015. Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . Originally designed to process Russian crudes, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced the two plants to use local crudes as feedstock. A third refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. This 50,000b/d plant also processes local light sweet crudes sourced from Dragon Oil's Cheleken Contract Area in the Black Sea. In order to increase refining capacity, Turkmenistan is reportedly looking into expanding both of the state owned plants and adding three new refineries. According to an unnamed government official cited by Turkmenistan Gas Production, Consumption And Exports e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecasts BMI Refining And Oil Products Trade Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Reuters in March 2011, Turkmenistan wants to increase capacity at both refineries to 9mn tpa each, equivalent to 180,000b/d each. He did not say when the expansion projects would take place. He claimed that the country also plans to build a third state-owned refinery in the Balkan Province near Dragon Oil's facility by 2025. A further two refineries are planned by 2030 in the eastern regions of Mary and Akhai. With a combined capacity of around 240,000b/d, these three greenfield refineries would likely be smaller than the two existing state-owned plants. The official did not specify whether the three new refineries would also be state owned. Nevertheless, he claimed that the government plans to launch international tenders for the plants, in a move that could create opportunities for oil and gas construction companies such as Technip, KBR, and WorleyParsons, all of which have worked on projects in Turkmenistan. In March 2011 an unnamed source, cited by Reuters, said that Turkmenistan planned to increase refining volumes to 400,000b/d by 2020, to 440,000b/d by 2025 and to 600,000b/d by 2030. In BMI's view these highly ambitious refining targets are unlikely to be achieved. Without any indications of any of these projects actually going ahead, we have not included the expansions in our current forecasts. The picture for oil export revenues is relatively bright. Turkmenistan should earn an estimated US$3bn from crude in 2011, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$7bn by 2015. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2015 are US$20bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2015 total could be US$27bn, against an estimated US$8bn in 2011.

Source: Historical data, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010. Forecasts, BMI The revenue picture painted above owes much to rising output and relatively high oil prices. There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise with the higher export volumes. At a flat US$50/bbl oil price from now until 2015, petroleum export revenues would rise to US$15bn. However, at a flat US$100/bbl, the export 2015 export revenues would be US$30bn. Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 56%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d at the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption is set to increase by 62% between 2010 and 2020, with growth of 5% per annum and the country using 204,000b/d by 2020. Gas production should rise from the Key Risks To BMIs Forecast Scenario Long-Term Oil And Gas Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 estimated 2010 level of 42bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 20bcm to 95bcm. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Oil And Gas Infrastructure Oil Refineries Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . Originally designed to process Russian crudes, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced the two plants to use local crudes as feedstock. A third refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. This 50,000b/d plant also processes local light sweet crudes sourced from Dragon Oil's Cheleken Contract Area in the Black Sea. In order to increase refining capacity, Turkmenistan is reportedly looking into expanding both of the state owned plants and adding three new refineries. According to an unnamed government official cited by Reuters in March 2011, Turkmenistan wants to increase capacity at both refineries to 9mn tpa each, equivalent to 180,000b/d each. He did not say when the expansion projects would take place. He claimed that the country also plans to build a third state-owned refinery in the Balkan Province near Dragon Oil's facility by 2025. A further two refineries are planned by 2030 in the eastern regions of Mary and Akhai. With a combined capacity of around 240,000b/d, these three greenfield refineries would likely be smaller than the two existing state-owned plants. The official did not specify whether the three new refineries would also be state owned. Nevertheless, he claimed that the government plans to launch international tenders for the plants, in a move that could create opportunities for oil and gas construction companies such as Technip, KBR, and WorleyParsons, all of which have worked on projects in Turkmenistan. In March 2011 an unnamed source, cited by Reuters, said that Turkmenistan planned to increase refining volumes to 400,000b/d by 2020, to 440,000b/d by 2025 and to 600,000b/d by 2030. In BMI's view these highly ambitious refining targets are unlikely to be achieved. Without any indications of any of these projects actually going ahead, we have not included the expansions in our current forecasts. Oil and oil products are exported from Turkmenistan by sea from the Kenar, Aladzha and Ekerem terminals. The throughput capacity of Kenar is 22mn bbl per year and it can accommodate tankers with a Oil Storage Facilities The countrys main oil storage depot at Zerger was expanded in 2006 from a capacity of 124,666 bbl to its current capacity of 161,332 bbl. Oil Terminals/Ports Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 deadweight of up to 5,000 tonnes, while the Aladzha terminal has a throughput capacity of up to 17mn bbl of oil per year. The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year and the facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 deadweight tonnes. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Interconnector Pipeline May 2010, saw the launch of construction of the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum and construction is scheduled for completion in 2015. The pipeline will play a critical role in gas exports, allowing gas to be transported to different export destinations according to market conditions and preferences. It is seen as vital part of plans for eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. While gas exports to Europe are a possibility, pre-requisites include the resolution of Caspian Sea maritime border disputes and the construction of a subsea pipeline, neither of which BMI sees as likely in the short term. Given CNPC's investment in South Yolotan, eastward gas exports to China are set to rise in the coming years. Turkmenistan-Iran Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline, was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009. Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010 the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline. The second leg of the pipeline runs from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase was completed at the end of 2010, bringing the capacity to around 16bcm. He said that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Central Asian Gas Pipeline The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Central Asia-Center Until recently, Soviet-era Central Asia-Center line to Russia was Turkmenistans sole export trunkline. Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on CAC in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India During his visit to Turkmenistan in November 2009, Eni's CEO Paolo Scaroni offered assistance to the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. The proposed TAPI pipeline would supply 32bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Officials from the governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a deal in Islamabad on April 24 2008 to buy gas from Turkmenistan. The mountainous terrain that the route would have to cross presents significant technical challenges, however, and the US-led war in Afghanistan means that the pipeline is a distant prospect. The four countries behind the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in September 2010 signed two preliminary deals confirming their support for the project. Although the security and political problems that have plagued the project have not yet been resolved, the signing of the deal is a clear statement of intent by the four partners. According to a Reuters report, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat on September 20. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan will receive 5Mcm/d from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 14Mcm/d afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline will include a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Turkmenistan, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed another deal for the pipeline in December 2010. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Russia signed an agreement in January 2011 with Afghanistan to help build the proposed TAPI gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. Although Russian involvement could boost the project's chances of going ahead, it undermines TAPI's aim of diversifying Central Asia's gas export routes away from Russia. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early-December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Macroeconomic Outlook Strong Growth, Elevated Commodity Prices To Push Up InflationBMI View: We hold to our forecast for consumer price inflation in Turkmenistan to average 6% in 2011, up from 4% in 2010. A strong economic performance this year, for which we forecast 9% real GDP growth, will provide domestic price pressures, while elevated food costs will increase imported inflationary pressures. We continue to forecast consumer price inflation averaging 6% year-on-year in Turkmenistan this year, after increasing by 4% in 2010. In our view, the country will experience both cost-push and demand-pull inflationary pressures throughout the rest of 2011. We caution, however, that monitoring inflationary pressures in the Turkmen economy remains difficult, given the dominant position of the black market. Our forecast for the Turkmen economy to experience robust growth - we have pencilled in 9% real GDP growth this year, after a 9% expansion in 2010 - will put upward demand-side pressure on consumer prices. Moreover, we expect the government's sustained public investment in infrastructure and energy to put further upside pressure on consumer prices throughout 2011. On the other side of the coin, elevated global food prices will also work to push up consumer prices. That said, our commodities team's view that global food prices should come off the boil in the second half of this year as global supply-side bottlenecks ease leads us to believe that inflationary pressures will not be significantly more pronounced. Furthermore, the government's policy of fully subsidising energy costs means that the knock-on effects of higher global oil prices will be somewhat muted.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 38 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Competitive Landscape Executive Summary The main government vehicle is state-owned Turkmenneft. IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. Petronas began producing from the Diyarbakir field in 2006. Petronas production increased from 4,700b/d of oil in the financial year ending March 31 2008 to 6,400b/d in FY08-09. In February 2008 Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2009, Eni produced an average of 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2008. The largest minority investor in oil explorer Dragon Oil has rejected a takeover bid from controlling shareholder ENOC that valued Dragon at US$3bn. In 2009 Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea. Germanys RWE Dea in July 2009 announced that it signed a PSA to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. RWE will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities at the block between 2010 and 2014. The State Information Agency of Turkmenistan announced the start of production at the Yylakly field in the Central Karakum desert in early July 2009. First oil from the field, which was developed by subsidiaries of Turkmenneft, was transported to an oil facility around 65km south of the field, which was inaugurated on the same day. From there, the oil was sent by rail to the system of pipelines connected to the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries. Production is expected to reach a peak of 1,095b/d. The development of the Mydar field, also in the Central Karakum desert, is expected to start soon, with daily output expected to reach up to 2,555b/d of oil. State-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary reported in August 2008 that the South Gutlyayak field is producing some 200,000cm/d of gas and condensate, equal to 73Mcm per annum.

Source: BMI Licensing And Regulation In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been PSAs. The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. Turkmenistan's energy ministry has said it will not invite foreign oil and gas explorers to invest in its onshore gas fields, Reuters reported in March 2011. External players will therefore only be allowed to carry out exploration and production in the country's sector of the Caspian Sea. They will, however, be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. Company 2010 Sales % share of total sales No. of employees Overview/State Role Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Government Policy President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn of cumulative investment in hydrocarbons sector by 2010, but the figure proved a serious overestimation. In 2010, the government believes it will receive US$4bn, up from US$2bn in 2009. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI at US$753mn. At least US$5bn per year over the next decade will need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMXs Jennifer Coolige argued there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be opening up under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya Basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. State-run Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. International Energy Relations Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan said in November 2009. This was not confirmed by Turkmen officials but in October 2010, government sources said Chervon and French major Total are negotiating their entrance into the Turkmen Caspian Shelf. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010 an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has been aggressively pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 In 2008 Russia paid US$140 per thousand cubic metres for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May. During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late-2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. Although the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In January 2011 it was announced that Gazprom will buy around 38bcm of gas from Central Asian nations during 2011. This represents an increase of 2% y-o-y from about 38bcm in 2010. It is not clear how much of this will come from Turkmenistan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010 Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. An onward link to Tehran was completed by the Iranians in November 2010. The Dauletabad-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Iran has long been seen as a potential exporter of gas to Europe, or as a transit route for Central Asian gas. The completion of the second Turkmenistan-Iran gas pipeline makes this plan far more feasible. However, the main problems with the project have long been political rather than technological, with the EU currently opposed to Iranian gas imports. This stance appears to be justified by a US diplomatic communiqu released by website Wikileaks. According to the cable, Iran is interested in exporting gas to the EU in the belief that this will increase its political leverage and to help insulate it from sanctions. Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Tehran in February 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which covers a total of about 7,000km, transports gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008 Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. India and Turkmenistan have agreed to step up energy cooperation after high-level discussions during Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's first visit to India. The two sides expressed interest in several projects to transport Turkmen gas to India, including the long-mooted TAPI pipeline. However, BMI sees the political, security and technical challenges to the project as overwhelming making a gas-swap deal with Iran a more likely option. The proposed US$4bn TAPI pipeline would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to India, which joined the project in 2008. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan would receive 1bcm per year from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 5bcm per year afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. TAPI was originally proposed in the mid-1990s by a US-led consortium but the project was placed on the back burner after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. While the war in Afghanistan has continued this has remained the case, and India and Pakistan's fractious relations have also stymied any further progress. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious TAPI pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Turkmenistan, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed another deal for the pipeline in December 2010. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Russia signed an agreement in January 2011 with Afghanistan to help build the proposed TAPI gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. Although Russian involvement could boost the project's chances of going ahead, it undermines TAPI's aim of diversifying Central Asia's gas export routes away from Russia.

In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov.

In January 2008, Eni had secured 77% of Burren in an agreed GBP1bn. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In its 2010 annual report Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2009, suggesting its existing producing assets have reached a plateau. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Latest Developments Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy in November 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies pursuing a steady drilling effort in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences.

The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of 8-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early 2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rising to a record 44,765b/d in 2009. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, down US$100mn from the 2009-2011 period. As of 2010 the company claims cumulative investment of US$1bn in the country. In late 2010 it announced plans to boost output to 75,000b/d, without specifying the projects involved. Dragon plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including five appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Latest Developments According to a Bloomberg report in April 2011, Dragon Oil expects production growth of as much as 20% this year as it adds wells. Three new wells have been put into production this year, the Dubai-based company said in a Regulatory News Service statement. The average daily production rate was about 57,800 bbl in the three months ended March 31, up from 47,600b/d a year earlier. The company upgraded its reserves to 639mn bbl of oil and condensate at the year-end and 1trn cubic feet of gas . Dragon maintained its medium-term production target of 10-15% growth on average per annum between 2011 and 2013. Dragon Oil's oil production hit 52,575b/d in December 2010. This was up 10% y-o-y, compared with 47,463b/d of oil production in December 2009. Average daily oil production in 2010 was up 5% y-o-y to 47,211b/d, compared with 44,765b/d in 2009. Production rose owing to the launch of new facilities and Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 the removal of infrastructural bottlenecks. The companys reserves at its Turkmenistan field rose by 3% y-o-y to 639mn bbl of oil and condensate. Gas reserves at the field are 45bcm. Dragon completed initial testing of the Dzheitune 28/151 development well in early January 2011. A 14-inch in-field pipeline running from the Dzheitune B platform to the Dzheitune 28 platform has also been commissioned. The well, drilled to a total depth of 3,512m with the NIS rig, flowed at an initial combined rate of 2,656b/d of oil. Dragon finished the first drilling and completion phase at two of its Caspian wells in November 2010. The Dzheitune B/148 and 28/149 development wells are part of a series to be drilled at the Dzheitune B platform offshore Turkmenistan. B/148 has been drilled to a depth of 3,858m and 28/149 reached a depth of 3,295m. In mid-May 2010, Dragon Oil issued details of contracts it had awarded to construct two rig platforms in its Cheleken contract area, in the Turkmen waters of the Caspian Sea. The company believes that the platforms, which will allow the drilling of up to 16 new wells, will help the company achieve its production targets. The Dzhygalybeg A platform, to be built by Q112, will support a land rig and a jack-up rig and will allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Zhdanov field. The Dzheitune C platform, to be built by Q411, will support a jack-up rig and allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Lam Field. In April 2010, Dragon Oil announced that it had reached an agreement with a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company on a new short-term deal to replace a crude oil swap agreement that expired on 31 March 2010. The swap deal signed with NIOC subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company involves Dragon exporting its Turkmen crude to the Iranian Caspian port of Bandar Neka, where it is then marketed locally. In exchange, NIOC allocates Iranian crude oil to Dragon at the Kharg Island terminal, located in the Persian Gulf. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Petronas Summary Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has told the Turkmen government that it could be producing up to 5bcm of gas from Block 1, with production expected to be increased to 10bcm at a later stage. Currently only oil is produced from the field. President Berdymukhamedov met Petronas former president, Hassan Marican, on May 15 2009 to discuss the companys Turkmenistan activities, according to Reuters. Petronas estimates that the field has 150bcm of reserves. In June 2009 Petronas said it would start installation work at Block 1 in early-2010. The facilities at the block will include a drilling platform, a wellhead platform and offshore pipelines. Offshore contractor Sigur Ros has signed a letter of intent to supply the crew and equipment required for the pipe laying work. First gas from the first phase of the block was scheduled for Q310 but appears to have been delayed. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. CNPC has reported what appears to be a major gas discovery in September 2010. CNPC reported that exploration well Oja-21 in Block B maintained a flow of 1mn Mcm/d of gas and 36cm/d of condensate during testing. The company has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bn bcm of reserves. China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Gazprom Summary Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 in its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal on September 13 2009 with Turkmenistan to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which have been tense since April following an explosion on Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite its dispute with Gazprom. Discussions on the project had been ongoing since February 18. By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its former partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for 16 years and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman Igor Makarov, this is the first time the company has been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Itera Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Preliminary estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas a year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Summary RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April when RWE CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistan President Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which has been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3D seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. The company in April 2010 said it would invest US$60-80mn in the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said to have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. The deal is yet to materialise. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil has returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010 in response to earlier media reports. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Canadian-registered independent Buried Hill Energy claimed that it signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Others Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 54 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan, confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Serbia's oil monopoly Naftna Industrija Srbije has won an upstream deal in Turkmenistan valued at US$33mn, the company said in a January 12 2011 statement quoted by Reuters. NIS will drill two 4,800m wells in the Akpatlauk oil field, two 3,800m wells in the Ekerem oil field and one 4,500m well in the Keimir oil field, all of which are being developed by Turkmenneft. The project is expected to start in June 2011 and be completed by February 2012. Petrofac Among the Western firms, Petrofac has gained a major first mover advantage in Turkmenistan, winning a deal to develop the giant South Yolotan field on behalf Turkmengaz in 2009. In mid-2010, construction began on a new US$2bn pipeline, with 30bcm of capacity, connecting South Yolotan-Osman to Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast. Petrofac completed work on South Yolotan's first phase in December 2009, working as a contractor to Turkmengaz. That contract was worth US$100mn. In the same month, Petrofac won a contract to undertake a FEED study and initial planning for the second phase infrastructure. South Yolotan represents Petrofac's sole ongoing Turkmen operation. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the project's US$3bn second phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. The second phase will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. Service Companies Business Monitor International Ltd Page 55 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Oil And Gas Outlook: Long-Term Forecasts Regional Oil Demand A continuation of the 2010-2015 oil demand trend is predicted for the 2015-2020 period, reflecting the under-developed nature of several key economies, ongoing wealth generation thanks to rising export volumes, plus the maturing of new EU member states. The regions oil consumption is expected to increase by 13% in 2015-2020, after 13% growth in the period 2010-2015. Over the extended 2010 to 2020 forecast period, Azerbaijan leads the way, with oil demand increasing by an estimated 96%, followed by Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (+62%) and Kazakhstans 39% growth.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 56 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Regional Oil Supply CEE oil production is forecast to fall 6% from 2010 to 2020, with a likely plateau approaching in Russian, Kazakh and Azeri output, and no other major country expected to have substantial longer-term upside potential. Kazakhstan is by far the biggest contributor to growth, with output forecast to rise by 30% between 2010 and 2020. Turkmenistan exceeds it in percentage terms (+56%), but is a much smaller absolute contributor. Russia has the weakest production trend among the major producers, with a likely 5% gain between 2010 and 2020.

Cheap and plentiful local crude supplies help make it a region of choice for refinery investment, although government control of the downstream industry will need to be eased. Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, Turkey and Bulgaria have particularly ambitious expansion plans, reflecting either crude output growth or local demand expansion. The region should increase in importance as a net exporter of refined products.

There is likely to be some 15% gas market expansion in the region in the final five years of the period. Expansion of gas consumption is expected to be at its greatest in Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan and Poland. Russia is likely to lag the field.

Kazakhstans explosive growth in the first half of the forecast period is not sustainable, with volumes set to rise 21% in 2015-2020, compared with a growth rate of 65% in 2010-2015. Russia is still the key player in the region, with gas output rising 23% between 2010 and 2020. Turkmenistans supply is expected to increase by 233% over the same period.

Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 56%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d at the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption is set to increase by 62% between 2010 and 2020, with growth of 5% per annum and the country using 204,000b/d by 2020. Gas production should rise from the Turkmenistan Country Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 61 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 estimated 2010 level of 42bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 20bcm to 95bcm. Methodology And Risks To Forecasts In terms of oil and gas supply, as well as refining capacity, the projections are wherever possible based on known development projects, committed investment plans or stated government/company intentions. A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historical reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

Our approach has been threefold. First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all 16 industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline Oil & Gas BER is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of Upstream/Downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients, who will have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite for their operations. Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% Upstream BER and 50% Downstream BER: Upstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Upstream rating which is composed of limits/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Downstream rating which comprises limits/risks . Both the Upstream BER and Downstream BER are composed of Limits/Risks sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader Country Risk components: Limits of Potential Returns: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Ratings Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 64 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Risks to Realisation of those Returns: Evaluates both Industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Rule of Law Legal Framework Physical Infrastructure Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 68 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts BMI's industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 69 Turkmenistan Oil and Gas Report Q3 2011 Energy Industry There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy Supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: national energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; international quotas, guidelines and projections, such as OPEC, IEA, US Energy Information Administration . Energy Consumption A mixture of methods is used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historical relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts, based on company- or state-specific investment levels Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third-party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Cross Checks Sources Sources include those international bodies mentioned above, such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news agencies.

b41ec981-724b-42a9-b254-b842f7207e52,"June 14 - US Senator John McCain has spoken for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Transdniestria. Russian troops remain in Moldova in violation of provisions of international law, he said at a Sunday briefing in Chisinau at the end of his visit to Moldova. The United States supports democratic reforms in Moldova, the government's policy of democratic and economic reforms, European integration and the settlement of the Transdniestrian conflict, he said. The United States also supports the territorial integrity of Moldova and believes that the withdrawal of Russian troops will promote the Transdniestrian settlement. Senator McCain expressed readiness to support the cancellation of the Jackson-Vanik amendment with regard to Moldova stressing that this would promote the development of bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries. After meeting the leadership of Moldova he expressed disappointment with the refusal of the leaders of the opposition Communist Party to meet him. He said he wanted to hear all viewpoints about the future cooperation and development of Moldova. He said that probably next time he would succeed in meeting the Communists. The senator came to Chisinau at the invitation of Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat.

Page 5 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Executive Summary The latest Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report from BMI forecasts that the country will account for 2% of Central and Eastern European regional oil demand by 2015, while providing 2% of supply. CEE regional oil use of 5mn barrels per day in 2001 rose to an estimated 6mn b/d in 2010. It should increase to around 6mn b/d by 2015. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001 and in 2010 averaged an estimated 13mn b/d. It is set to rise to 15mn b/d by 2015. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total rose to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 8mn b/d by 2015. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the most important exporter. In terms of natural gas, the region in 2010 consumed an estimated 636bn cubic metres , with demand of 736bcm targeted for 2015, representing 15% growth. Production of an estimated 787bcm in 2010 should reach 954bcm in 2015, which implies net exports rising from an estimated 151bcm in 2010 to 217bcm by the end of the period. Turkmenistans share of consumption in 2010 was an estimated 3%, while its share of production is put at 8%. By 2015, its share of demand is forecast to be 4%, with the country accounting for 9% of supply. The 2010 full-year outturn was US$77/bbl for OPEC crude, which delivered an average for North Sea Brent of US$80/bbl and for West Texas Intermediate of US$79/bbl. The BMI price target of US$77 was reached thanks to the early onset of particularly cold weather, which drove up demand for and the price of heating oil during the closing weeks of the year. We set our 2011 supply, demand and price forecasts in early January, targeting global oil demand growth of 1% and supply growth of 1%. With OECD inventories at the top of their five-year average range, we set a price forecast of US$80/bbl average for the OPEC basket in 2011. The unprecedented wave of popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa that followed the removal of Tunisian President Ben Ali on January 14 has obviously fundamentally altered our outlook, particularly since the unrest spread to Libya in mid-February. Taking into account the risk premium that has been added to crude prices in response to actual and perceived threats to supply, we have now raised our benchmark OPEC basket price forecast from US$80 to US$90/bbl for 2011 and from US$85 to US$95/bbl for 2012. Based on our expectations for differentials, this gives a forecast for Brent at US$94/bbl in 2011 and US$99/bbl in 2012. We have kept our long-term price assumption of US$90/bbl in place for the time being while we wait to see what path events in the MENA region take. We have also retained our existing supply and demand forecasts until the scheduled quarterly revision at the start of April. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 BMI estimates that Turkmen real GDP rose by 9% in 2010, followed by average annual growth of 10% from 2011 to 2015. Domestic consumption trends can be expected to return to a strong growth tack from 2010 onwards, estimated at an average of 5% per annum. By 2015, the country could be using 158,000b/d of oil. Turkmenistan has traditionally been protective of its onshore basins, allowing international oil companies to participate only in offshore developments. Offshore activity should help raise national crude and gas liquids output from an estimated 220,000b/d in 2010 to 375,000b/d by 2015. Gas production is expected to increase from an estimated 65bcm to 90bcm between 2010 and 2015. Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 54%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d at the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption is set to increase by 62% between 2010 and 2020, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 201,000b/d by 2020. Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 96bcm. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Turkmenistan shares 11th place with Uzbekistan in BMIs composite Business Environment ratings table, which combines upstream and downstream scores. It shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in joint 10th place, alongside Slovenia. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Political SWOT Strengths Common strategic interests will smooth regional relations with Turkmenistan's energy-hungry neighbours such as China, and possibly even the EU. Weaknesses Despite growing discontent over increased repression and corruption, there is little prospect of an organised opposition gaining a foothold. Harsh methods will be used to suppress public protest, and multimillion-dollar contracts signed with Western companies will mute business support. Opportunities The stable transition of power after Saparmurat Niyazov's death is a positive sign of political stability. President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedovs early policies indicate that he may be willing to forge greater trade and business links with foreign countries. Threats Turkmenistan will remain one of the world's most restrictive societies, and with few of the benefits from increased hydrocarbon sales reaching the population, there remains some risk of civil uprising. Turkmenistan Economic SWOT Strengths Economic activity will be supported by the ongoing expansion of energy production and exports, ensuring strong growth in the medium term. The government's ambitious strategy for a fivefold increase in real GDP between 2000 and 2010 will encourage efforts to boost sustainability in all sectors of the economy. Weaknesses The official economic figures remain unreliable, reflecting the legacy of the Soviet era when only 'positive data' were released. With fiscal management opaque, international financial institutions will continue to find it hard to analyse and support Turkmenistan's economic development. The persistence of central planning, with government use of production targets and mandatory state procurement, will prevent efficient resource allocation, risking shortages of consumer goods, inflationary pressure and stunted growth. Opportunities A gas pipeline to China, currently under construction, will help diversify the country's export markets. Moreover, the country is also considering diversifying its gas export routes to Europe, bypassing Russia. The trade surplus provides an opportunity for the government to diversify the economy. Threats Trade levels will continue to fluctuate greatly while gas markets remain vulnerable to interruptions in pipeline access and external shocks. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Turkmenistan Business Environment SWOT Strengths Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2010. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm, ranking it among the worlds top five countries. Weaknesses Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow have soured, following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Opportunities Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC- friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. The country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. In May 2007, the chairman of state company Turkmengaz, Yashygeldy Kakayev, said the countrys energy strategy was to almost double gas production to 120bcm by 2010 and more than treble production to 240bcm by 2030. Threats Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Turkmenistan Energy Market Overview Once-isolationist Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is bringing back foreign partners. Some, however, have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of around 8,100bcm , ranking it among the worlds top five countries. The country contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya Basin in the east, and the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian Basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. The revision puts reserve estimates above the high estimate made by UK-based international advisory firm Gaffney Cline & Associates when it conducted the first independent assessment of the field in October 2008. GCA put the field's low reserves estimate at 4,000bcm, the best estimate at 6,000bcm and the high estimate at 14,000bcm. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998 as Russia denied the country access to export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger has said that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Speaking to a think-tank conference in Brussels in January 2011, Oettinger said that the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev was prepared to sell 18-21bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor. Azerbaijan could start gas exports to the EU in 2016-2019, according to the Knight Ridder news agency. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell another 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with Business Monitor International Ltd Page 11 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. The Southern Corridor project aims to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas imports by establishing a direct route to import gas from the Caspian region. The main component of the project is the Nabucco pipeline, which will run from Turkey to Azerbaijan. From Turkey, the corridor extends to include the planned Trans-Adriatic Pipeline project and the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline, as well as the proposed White Stream pipeline. Nabucco has stalled because of an inability to secure sufficient quantities of feedstock gas from Azerbaijan. Russia has signed an agreement with Afghanistan to help build the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. The proposed US$4bn TAPI pipeline would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to India, which joined the project in 2008. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan would receive 1bcm per year from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 5bcm per year afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Review, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2010. The government targets higher production, but the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals because of a shifting interest to gas production and lagging foreign investment. The country exports around half of its production. Local demand is estimated at 124,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. In February 2008, the president introduced a new fuels retail system providing transportation customers with free gasoline up to a specified level and charging a market rate, established by the state, for amounts exceeding the quota. Turkmenistan has two major refineries, Seidi and Turkmenbashi, with a combined total capacity of 237,000b/d . Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. In terms of electricity, Turkmenistans installed generating capacity is estimated at 3gigawatts , with recent generation put at around 17terawatt hours . With consumption averaging around 9TWh, there is a useful net export capability. Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energyis now owned by Italys Eni group. Turkmenistan is set to open development of its offshore Caspian oil deposits to US majors for the first time. Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov in August 2010 selected US majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips as well as US-based TX Oil and Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Oil and Gas to develop blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian Sea, according to Reuters quoting state television. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Global Oil Market Outlook The oil market activity of late 2010 was entirely as we predicted, with the result that the full-year price outturn of around US$77per barrel for the OPEC basket was barely above the BMI assumption. Dramatic winter scenes certainly helped provide an end-year shift in sentiment, even if actual crude consumption levels, as 12 months earlier, end up being little changed by the heating oil effect. BMI has long held the view that we would see further appreciation in 2011 thanks to demand growth, moderate supply expansion and some room for inventories to ease. As of mid-January 2011, BMI assumptions were that global growth in GDP would exceed 3% in the current year and through to 2014, with a likely 3% rise in 2011 accelerating to a 3% rate of growth in 2012 and 2013. While this has no direct correlation with oil prices and, in fact, little real relevance to oil consumption trends, it supported our view at the start of the year of a steady increase in crude prices in 2011, reflecting an improved supply/demand balance, greater OPEC influence and falling inventories. The unprecedented wave of popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa that followed the removal of Tunisian President Ben Ali on January 14 has obviously fundamentally altered our outlook, particularly since the unrest spread to Libya in mid-February. Taking into account the risk premium that has been added to crude prices in response to actual and perceived additional threats to supply, we have now raised our benchmark OPEC basket price forecast from US$80 to US$90/bbl for 2011 and from US$85 to US$95/bbl for 2012. Based on our expectations for differentials, this gives a forecast for Brent at US$94/bbl in 2011 and US$99/bbl in 2012. We have kept our long-term price assumption of US$90/bbl in place for the time being while we wait to see what path events in the MENA region take. We have also retained our existing supply and demand forecasts until the scheduled quarterly revision at the start of April. Oil demand in 2011 will almost certainly increase from 2010 levels. Growth in absolute volumes and in percentage terms is likely to be appreciably lower but should still be significant. This growth is dependent on prices and underlying economic activity. Countering this positive factor is a list of negatives. First is the fragility of the energy-intensive developed economies where, as in 2008, substantial and sustained fuel cost inflation can cause great harm in terms of oil consumption and economic growth. Much of 2011s projected oil demand growth can be attributed to the non-OECD states, which may prove more robust. Even here, however, removal or reduction of price subsidies could lead to demand disappointment in a high-price environment. Balancing Act Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Inventories of crude oil and refined products are still healthy. During 2010, in spite of much higher demand, there was little improvement in the global stock position. In spite of the weather and tax-related end-year crude stock draw in the US, inventories at the end of 2010 were still some 75mn bbl above the five-year average, with refined product stocks almost 50mn bbl in excess of the seasonal norm. Europe and Japan actually reported late-year stock builds, so the inventory overhang is substantial. This year needs a widening of the supply/demand gap in order to ensure a meaningful stock drawdown, which is the most necessary step towards sustainable oil price growth. Excluding Libya, supply is on the rise, with a useful increase in non-OPEC oil production forecast in 2011. This alone could offset much of the forecast demand growth and leave inventories close to current levels. In addition, OPEC members, long frustrated with inadequate quotas, had already begun to place more oil on the market prior to the outbreak of political unrest in MENA. The removal of Libyan crude volumes from the market prompted Saudi Arabia to boost volumes, with reports in March that Nigeria, Kuwait and the UAE were preparing to follow suit. There remain question marks over the likes of Iran and Iraq, but the overall picture is likely to be one of reduced quota compliance and increased volumes. So far, OPEC has decided against holding an emergency meeting prior to its scheduled summit in June. The more hawkish members of the producers club oppose raising quotas, arguing that the oil market remains well supplied despite the lost Libyan volumes, while also enjoying the surge in export revenues that higher prices provide. If the unrest in MENA spreads to other oil producing countries, however, and prices look likely to push beyond US$120/bbl, we expect a meeting to be called urgently and quotas to be raised. No OPEC member wants to see a repeat of the crude price collapse in H208, which crushed the cartels revenues. A second half quota increase should not therefore be ruled out. While the extraordinary rise in prices in January and February has skewed the average price outlook for the year, in order for the oil price gains to be sustained, it is surely necessary for demand to rise more quickly than supply, thus reducing stocks and narrowing the safety margin. Too much oil price strength too early in the recovery will clearly weaken the demand trend, while encouraging suppliers. Bold speculators and charging bulls alone may not manage to create the conditions needed for crude to prosper in the long term. In terms of the OPEC basket of crudes, the average price in Q410 was about US$83/bbl, up from the US$73recorded during the previous three months. This was an encouraging, if unsurprising outcome, given the intervention of Arctic weather and growing macroeconomic optimism. In Q409, the OPEC price averaged US$74/bbl, so the most recent quarter saw a year-on-year gain of 12%. The 2010 full-year average works out at around US$77, compared with about US$60/bbl in 2009 (+27%). Oil Price Forecasts Business Monitor International Ltd Page 15 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 In terms of other marker prices, North Sea Brent averaged around US$86/bbl during Q4, with WTI achieving a surprisingly low US$85. This is another indication that WTI is much more prone to speculative activity and market sentiment than the other crudes, reducing its usefulness as a barometer of underlying fundamentals. Urals in Q4 averaged US$85/bbl and Dubai realised US$83. These averages have been calculated using OPEC data and monthly prices from the International Energy Agency . The 2010 full-year outturn was US$77/bbl for OPEC crude, US$80/bbl for Brent and for US$79/bbl for WTI. Taking into account the risk premium that has been added to crude prices in response to the unrest in MENA, we have raised our benchmark OPEC basket price forecast from US$80 to US$90/bbl for 2011 and from US$85 to US$95/bbl for 2012. Based on our expectations for differentials, this gives a forecast for Brent at US$94/bbl in 2011 and US$99/bbl in 2012. We have kept our long-term price assumption of US$90/bbl in place for the time being while we wait to see what path events in the MENA region take. The WTI, Brent, Urals and Dubai assumptions are US$92, US$92, US$91and US$90/bbl, respectively. We have also retained our existing supply and demand forecasts until the scheduled quarterly revision at the start of April. 2008 2009 2010e 2011f 2012f 2013f 2014f 2015f Brent 9661809499929292Urals - Med 9461789096919191WTI 9961798591929292OPEC basket 9460779095909090Dubai 9361789095898989 e/f = estimate/forecast. The BMI oil supply and demand assumptions for 2011 and beyond have once again been revised for all 72 countries forming part of our detailed coverage, reflecting the changing macroeconomic outlook and the impact of environmental initiatives. Investment in exploration, development and new production has continued to rise as a result of relatively stable crude prices, but deepwater activity has been set back by events in the Gulf of Mexico . Costs associated with oil field development and exploration/appraisal drilling are rising again with commodity and labour prices. Deepwater programmes remain particularly vulnerable thanks to equipment shortages, lack of personnel and the post-Macondo regulatory environment. Table: Oil Price Forecasts Short-Term Demand Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 We have once again made some changes to forecast oil production levels, in line with OPEC output and known project delays, with no clear evidence of large-scale spending changes by international oil companies or national oil companies . Even in the US, the backlash from BPs Macondo disaster has led to only minor revisions to the production outlook. Other deepwater-focused regions appear to be re-examining procedures and legislation, but continuing with most exploration and development programmes.

Source: Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. According to the BMI model, 2011 global oil consumption will increase by 1% from the 2010 level. The 2011 forecast represents slight lower OECD demand and a revised non-OECD increase of 3%. The overall increase in demand is estimated at 1mn b/d. North America is now expected to see expansion of just 15,000b/d, with OECD European demand set to recover by 30,000b/d. Non-OECD gains are expected to be 1% in Asia, 2% in Latin America, 2% in Central/Eastern Europe, 4% in the Middle East and 2% in Africa. The International Energy Agency is slightly more bullish in its January 2011 Oil Market Report , predicting a rise in 2011 oil demand of 1%, or 1mn b/d. The organisations assumptions suggest a 0% decline in 2011 OECD consumption, plus a 3% increase in non-OECD oil usage. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 January 2011 Energy Information Administration estimates suggest that world demand will rise from 86mn b/d in 2010 to 88mn b/d in 2011, with the 1mn b/d increase amounting to a gain of 1%. Non-OECD demand is predicted to increase by 3% , while OECD demand is expected to slip by 10,000b/d to 45mn b/d. Consumption in the US is expected to increase by 160,000b/d . With Canadian demand 1% higher and that of Europe 0% lower, it is in Japan that the US energy body sees the greatest risk of a decline forecasting a fall of 3%. OPECs January 2011 report suggests a likely increase in 2011 global oil consumption of 1mn b/d, or 1%. OECD demand is forecast to rise by 180,000b/d . Non-OECD demand is expected to average 41mn b/d, compared with 40mn b/d in 2010 (+2%). According to the revised BMI model, 2011 global oil production will rise by 1%, representing an OPEC increase of 2% and a non-OPEC gain of 1%. The overall increase in supply is estimated at 1mn b/d in 2011. We assume that the current OPEC production ceiling will be retained for the first half of 2011, but that actual output will exceed the Q410 level. There is scope for an increased OPEC production ceiling in H2, dependent on demand and prices, but quota adherence is expected to deteriorate even if the theoretical ceiling is retained. The EIA was in January 2011 forecasting a 170,000b/d y-o-y rise in non-OPEC oil output, representing a gain of just 0%. World oil production is predicted to be 87mn b/d in 2011, up from 86mn b/d (+1mn b/d) in 2010. The US organisation expects a 1mn b/d upturn in OPEC oil and natural gas liquids output. OPEC itself sees 2011 non-OPEC supply rising by 410,000b/d to 52mn b/d. In 2011, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional oils are expected to increase by 460,000b/d over the previous year to average 5mn b/d. The January 2011 OPEC monthly report argues that the call on OPEC crude is expected to average 29mn b/d, representing an upwards adjustment of 200,000b/d from its previous assessment and an increase of 400,000b/d from the previous year. The IEAs 2011 assumption for non-OPEC oil supply is 53mn b/d, representing a rise of 1%. This view is based on higher estimated Chinese oil production offset by marginally lower output in the OECD Pacific, the former Soviet Union, Latin America and global biofuels. OPEC production of natural gas liquids is expected to rise sharply from 5mn b/d to 5mn b/d. Increased biofuels supply (+9%) and a slight increase in processing gains implies a need for OPEC crude volumes of 29mn b/d in 2011. This is above OPECs estimated Q410 output of 29mn b/d.

Source: Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. The BMI model predicts average annual oil demand growth of 1% between 2011 and 2015, followed by 1% between 2015 and 2020. After the assumed 3% global demand recovery in 2010, we are assuming 1% growth in 2011, followed by 1% in 2012, 1% in 2013, 1% in 2014 and 1% in 2015. OECD oil demand growth is expected to remain relatively weak throughout the forecast period to 2020, reflecting market maturity, the ongoing effects of price-led demand destruction and the greater commitment to energy efficiency. Following the 1% rise in 2010 OECD oil consumption, we expect to see a decrease of 0% in 2011. On average, OECD demand is forecast to rise by 0% per annum in 2011-2015, then fall by 0% per annum in 2015-2020. Longer-Term Supply And Demand Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 For the non-OECD region, the demand trend in 2011-2015 is for 3% average annual market expansion, followed by 2% in 2015-2020. Demand growth is forecast to ease from 4% in 2010 to 3% in 2011. BMI is forecasting global oil supply increasing by an average 1% annually between 2011 and 2015, with an average yearly gain of 1% predicted in 2015-2020. We expect the trend to be at its weakest towards the end of the 10-year forecast period, with gains of just 0% and 0% predicted in 2019 and 2020. Non-OPEC oil production is expected to rise by an annual average of 1% in 2011-2015, then just 0% in 2015-2020. OPEC volumes are forecast to increase by an annual average of 2% between 2011 and 2015, rising to 2% per annum in 2015-2020. In 2012, the EIA is predicting world oil demand growth of 1mn b/d. Its current base case sees the world consuming 89mn b/d during the year, up around 1%. OECD consumption is expected to edge ahead, but the non-OECD countries are tipped to deliver 3% growth. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Regional Energy Market Overview Although Russia will continue to dominate oil supply in the region, backed by huge and under-exploited reserves, the Caspian states have an important role to play, with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan an increasingly significant factor. The growth rate in Russian oil supply has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the decade but the acceleration of Caspian expansion means that the region will make a growing contribution to world oil production. Russias gas deposits not only dominate regional supply but are also the biggest single source for Western Europe. While consumer countries wish to diversify away from Russia, there are no other regional suppliers of note. LNG is not a major trade for the CEE region, although Russia began exporting gas in March 2009 from the Far Eastern Sakhalin projects into the Asia Pacific markets. Russian 2009/10 production surprised on the upside, with output fighting back after tax adjustments were introduced and modified. The countrys supply had fallen in 2008, ending a strong growth trend that began in 2000. We see little risk of a downturn in 2011, but 2011/12 could emerge as the near-term peak in output. A decline below 10mn b/d is thought likely in 2013, before increased investment delivers extra volumes of Russian crude and supply rises towards 10mn b/d in 2015 and to 11mn b/d by 2016/2017. The other regional theme is the Caspian states and their ability to meet production and export targets. The ultimate long-term potential is in little doubt, but a mixture of technical, commercial and political factors looks set hold back the rate of supply expansion. In 2009/10, the previously expected strong growth in output evaporated in the wake of persistent technical and commercial problems. Azerbaijan has some near-term upside. Kazakhstans near-term output growth potential is limited thanks to technical problems and the Kashagan field dispute, but longer-term prospects are good once Kashagan becomes a major contributor. CEE oil production averaged an estimated 13mn b/d in 2010. The region's output is expected to be 13mn b/d in 2011 and to reach 15mn b/d by 2015. In terms of demand, the estimated 2010 average of 6mn b/d is set to rise to 6mn b/d by 2015. This means that net exports from the region will climb steadily, from an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 to 8mn b/d by 2015.

Historical data: BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010/BMI. Regional oil production was 8mn b/d in 2001 and in 2010 averaged an estimated 13mn b/d. It is set to rise to 15mn b/d by 2015. Turkmenistan in 2010 contributed an estimated 1% to regional oil production, with a market share of 2% expected in 2015. Oil exports are growing steadily, because demand growth is lagging the pace of supply expansion. In 2001, the region was exporting an average of 3mn b/d. This total rose to an estimated 7mn b/d in 2010 and is forecast to reach 8mn b/d by 2015. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have the greatest production growth potential, although Russia will remain the most important exporter.

Capacity expansion will lag that in most other emerging regions, although Russia plans a processing boost and the likes of Poland and Kazakhstan should also build new or expand existing facilities. The regions total capacity is forecast to reach 10mn b/d by 2015 well ahead of oil demand, therefore implying substantial net exports of refined products. Turkmenistan in 2010 accounted for an estimated 2% share of regional refining capacity, with its market share in 2015 expected to be 2%.

Land boundaries mean pipeline transportation of gas is the favoured option, particularly from Russia through the CEE region into Western Europe. However, Russia became an LNG exporter in 2009 as Gazprom/Shells Sakhalin-II project entered production. Also, Poland is planning medium- to long-term LNG imports as a means of diversifying supply away from Russia, while proposals are being discussed for a Croatian LNG terminal on the Adriatic coast, with imports possible by 2017. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Business Environment Ratings Central/Eastern Europe Region The CEE region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime. Oil production growth for the period to 2015 ranges from a negative 31% for Hungary to a positive 70% in Turkmenistan, while oil demand growth ranges from 9% to 40% across the region. Gas output is forecast to fall by 21% in Romania, but to rise 65% in Kazakhstan. The range for forecast gas consumption growth is from 13% to 65%. The political and economic environment varies, depending partly on market maturity and EU membership. Russia and the Caspian states are viewed as more volatile and less stable than the recent EU entrants. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Composite Scores Composite Business Environment scores are calculated using the average of individual upstream and downstream ratings. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan continue to dominate the top of the regional league table, taking first and second places with respective scores of 59and 58 points out of a possible 100. Slovenia takes the final place in the rankings, with a composite upstream and downstream score of 41 points out of the 100 available. The points spread in the CEE region is considerably narrower than elsewhere, with the lowest-ranked country having 69% of the score allocated to the highest-ranked. Russia now holds fifth place below Poland and Turkey, with a medium-term chance of catching those immediately above, but little hope of challenging the two leading Central Asian energy powerhouse states. Turkey is likely to remain in a close fight with Poland for position, while Romania and Ukraine are closely matched just above the middle of the league table, ahead of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria with their limited upstream resource potential. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are tied near the bottom and have the potential to challenge the trio immediately above them. Croatia and Slovakia are struggling to keep clear of Slovenia in last place.

Industry Rewards Industry Risks Country Rewards Rewards Country Risks Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan shares eighth place with Croatia and Uzbekistan in BMIs updated upstream Business Environment ratings. Its oil and gas production growth outlook, gas reserves, and asset immaturity work in the countrys favour, but are undermined by an unappealing risk environment. Scope exists for Turkmenistan to break away from its immediate rivals and to move further up the table. Industry Rewards: On the basis of upstream data alone, Turkmenistan is actually the second most attractive state in the CEE region, behind only Kazakhstan. This reflects the fourth- and second-placed oil and gas reserves, the third-ranked oil production growth outlook, and fourth-placed gas production prospects. Country Rewards: Contributing to Turkmenistans third highest position in the Rewards section is its unenviable country rewards rating, which takes 13th place ahead only of Uzbekistan and Russia. The state has greater ownership of upstream assets than many in the region, and the industry is only somewhat competitive, with few non-state companies operational. Industry Risks: Turkmenistan is ranked second from last, ahead only of Russia, in the Risks section of our ratings. Its joint 13th position for industry risks with Slovenia is due to its licensing environment, and the fact that there is little immediate chance of privatisation of state-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is the second least attractive in the region, ranked 14th ahead only of Uzbekistan. The best, and only respectable, score is for long-term policy continuity. Corruption is the key risk for private companies. Furthermore, their ability to operate is weakened by the countrys low-scoring physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Downstream Scores Russia/Turkey and Croatia now bracket the remaining 12 CEE states in the downstream rankings, with Turkey having again caught Russia, in spite of the size of Russias fuels market and refining capacity etc. Turkeys risk profile is substantially better and it may be able to retain a share of regional leadership over the medium term. Poland is now holding third place and is also a potential regional leader. Ukraine is now two points behind Poland, and is unlikely to challenge it during the next few quarters. Romania has overtaken the Czech Republic to take fifth place. Turkmenistan has remained clear of Uzbekistan, with the latter still tied with Bulgaria. Slovakia is just a point clear of Croatia at the foot of the table.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Overview Turkmenistan is in the lower half of the league table in BMIs downstream ratings, with few particularly high scores and progress further up the rankings unlikely over the next few quarters. Oil and gas demand growth prospects represent strong suits, putting the country in joint 10th place, alongside Slovenia. Industry Rewards: On the basis of downstream data alone, Turkmenistan ranks sixth above Romania among the regions 15 countries. This is attributable to the countrys ninth highest refining capacity, second highest gas demand growth outlook and joint third highest oil demand growth ranking. Country Rewards: Turkmenistan ranks eighth in terms of the Rewards section, although its country rewards rating holds last place in the region, behind even Uzbekistan and Slovenia. Growth in GDP per capita is the fifth highest for the entire region. Population ranks 11th and nominal GDP is the lowest in the region. Industry Risks: In the Risks section of our ratings, Turkmenistan is ranked 12th, just ahead of Ukraine. Its equal 11th place with Uzbekistan for industry risks reflects the challenging regulatory regime and the fact that there is little chance of near-term privatisation of government-held assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader country risks environment is ranked 13th, ahead only of Turkey and Ukraine. The scores for short-term policy continuity, short-term economic external risk and short-term economic growth risk are relatively high, but the country is let down by very low scores for legal framework, rule of law and physical infrastructure. Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Rewards Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Risk Summary Political President Berdymukhamedov has once again stated his openness to the formation of opposition parties, whilst speaking to parliament on January20 2011, echoing previous speeches in 2010. While the president has ostensibly embarked on a programme of economic and political liberalisation after taking over power four years ago, the country's political system remains authoritarian in nature, with Berdymukhamedov maintaining a close grip on the legislative and judicial branches of government. Ultimately, despite continued overtures to further political liberalisation, we do not expect the political environment to change considerably in the near future. According to a government official, Japan has agreed to help finance the construction of a US$1bn chemical plant in the ex-Soviet nation, which will help to produce much-needed fertilizers for the country's cotton crops. The majority of the funding from Japan will reportedly come from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the plant is expected to become operational by 2014. Despite its extensive development of domestic gas reserves over the past two years, Turkmenistan will remain a major cotton producer in the region for the foreseeable future, in our view. According to the Turkmen foreign ministry, Turkmenistan is reportedly set to begin construction on a new power line in the next two months to Afghanistan that will increase energy exports to the war-torn country by a factor of five. The project is not expected to be completed until late 2013 and will cost just less than US$400mn, but will also potentially also allow the export of electricity to be increased towards Pakistan and Tajikistan. Economic Business Environment Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Industry Forecast Scenario Oil And Gas Reserves Turkmenistan has proven oil reserves of roughly 600mn bbl, based on estimates by the BP Statistical Review, although the country claims probable and possible oil reserves of more than 2bn bbl, plus 6bn bbl of undiscovered reserves potential. Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. We are assuming no dramatic change in reserves even as production rises, with around 570mn bbl remaining by 2014/15. Turkmenistan has proven gas reserves of approximately 8,100bcm . All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Some sources such as Heren Energy and Western Geophysical estimate recoverable offshore reserves of more than 6,000bcm. We are forecasting an increase in gas reserves to at least 10,000bcm during the forecast period. In April 2010, Turkmenistan's oil and gas minister Bayramgeldy Nedirov highlighted the potential attractiveness of the country's onshore reserves when he told reporters that reserves estimates for the South Yolotan-Osman gas field had been raised to 16,000bcm. Nedirov said that the increased reserve estimate was the result of further exploration drilling at the field. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. State-run China National Petroleum Corporation has made a major gas discovery in Turkmenistan, according to a September 2010 Reuters report. CNPC has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bcm of reserves. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, but rebounded to an estimated 220,000b/d in 2010. The government is targeting higherproduction, but the oil sector is strugglingto meet its growth goals owing to ashifting interest to gas production andlagging foreign investment. According toreports in 2007, Turkmenistan aims toproduce 2mn b/d by 2030, which seems rather optimistic. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand is an estimated 120,000b/d and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI forecasts 2011 oil production averaging 240,000b/d, rising to 375,000b/d by 2015. Demand is forecast to increase from an estimated 124,000b/d to 158,000b/d by 2015, leaving export potential of up to 217,000b/d. Turkmenistan Oil Production, Consumption And Exports e/f = estimate/forecast. Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecasts BMI Gas Supply And Demand Consultant GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum productive capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. While GCA has not commented on how quickly the field could be brought on stream, the suggested output levels would significantly add to the countrys production volumes. UK-based services firm Petrofac has begun work on the second phase of the South Yolotan scheme. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the US$3bn phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. It will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Remarks by a Turkmen energy official suggest that Petronas's Block-1 could have started exporting gas by early-2011, with an anonymous source claiming Russia could be the export destination.The head of Turkmenistan's State Agency on Management of Hydrocarbon Resources, Yagshigeldy Kakayev, said that production would reach 5bcm per year during the first phase of development, rising to 10bcm at an unspecified date. He said the gas would be exported, but did not say what the destination would be. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 65bcm in 2010 to 90bcm by 2014/15, with growth continuing beyond this point as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 21bcm to 31bcm during the period, so exports could reach 59bcm by 2015. Turkmenistan Gas Production, Consumption And Exports e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical data BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecasts BMI Refining And Oil Products Trade Turkmenistan has two refineries, one at Chardzou and the other at Turkmenbashi, with a combined capacity of 237,000b/d. However, Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which processes only high-sulphur crude. Revenues/Import Costs Current BMI oil price assumptions are for an OPEC basket of US$90/bbl in 2011, followed by US$95/bbl in 2012, and an average of US$90/bbl in 2013-2015. The picture for oil export revenues is therefore relatively bright. Turkmenistan should earn an estimated US$3bn from crude in 2011, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$7bn by 2015. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2015 are US$20bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2015 total could be US$28bn, against an estimated US$18bn in 2011.

Source: Historical data, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010. Forecasts, BMI The revenue picture painted above owes much to rising output and relatively high oil prices. There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise with the higher export volumes. At a flat US$50/bbl oil price from now until 2015, petroleum export revenues would rise to US$15bn. However, at a flat US$100/bbl, the export 2015 export revenues would be US$31bn. Details of BMIs 10-year forecasts can be found in the appendix to this report. Between 2010 and 2020, we are forecasting an increase in Turkmen oil and gas liquids production of 54%, with volumes peaking at 375,000b/d in 2015, before falling to 339,000b/d by the end of the 10-year forecast period. Oil consumption between 2010 and 2020 is set to increase by 62%, with growth slowing to an assumed 5% per annum towards the end of the period and the country using 201,000b/d by 2020. Gas production Key Risks To BMIs Forecast Scenario Long-Term Oil And Gas Outlook Business Monitor International Ltd Page 39 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 96bcm. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Oil And Gas Infrastructure Oil Refineries Turkmenistan has two refineries with a total capacity of 237,000b/d. One is at Chardzou, near the border with Uzbekistan, and has 120,493b/d capacity, while the other is at Turkmenbashi, with a crude processing capacity of 116,477b/d. Turkmenistans refinery system is underutilised, however, and throughput represents only about half of nameplate capacity. Oil and oil products are exported from Turkmenistan by sea from the Kenar, Aladzha and Ekerem terminals. The throughput capacity of Kenar is 22mn bbl per year and it can accommodate tankers with a deadweight of up to 5,000 tonnes, while the Aladzha terminal has a throughput capacity of up to 17mn bbl of oil per year. The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year and the facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 deadweight tonnes. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Interconnector Pipeline May 2010, saw the launch of construction of the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum and construction is scheduled for completion in 2015. Oil Storage Facilities The countrys main oil storage depot at Zerger was expanded in 2006 from a capacity of 124,666 bbl to its current capacity of 161,332 bbl. Oil Terminals/Ports Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 The pipeline will play a critical role in gas exports, allowing gas to be transported to different export destinations according to market conditions and preferences. It is seen as vital part of plans for eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. While gas exports to Europe are a possibility, pre-requisites include the resolution of Caspian Sea maritime border disputes and the construction of a subsea pipeline, neither of which BMI sees as likely in the short term. Given CNPC's investment in South Yolotan, eastward gas exports to China are set to rise in the coming years. Turkmenistan-Iran Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline, was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010 the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010 through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline. The second leg of the pipeline runs from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase was completed at the end of 2010, bringing the capacity to around 16bcm. He said that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Central Asian Gas Pipeline The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch across a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 42 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Central Asia-Center Until recently, Soviet-era Central Asia-Center line to Russia was Turkmenistans sole export trunkline. Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on CAC in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India During his visit to Turkmenistan in November 2009, Eni's CEO Paolo Scaroni offered assistance to the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. The proposed TAPI pipeline would supply 32bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Officials from the governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a deal in Islamabad on April 24 2008 to buy gas from Turkmenistan. The mountainous terrain that the route would have to cross presents significant technical challenges, however, and the US-led war in Afghanistan means that the pipeline is a distant prospect. The four countries behind the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in September 2010 signed two preliminary deals confirming their support for the project. Although the security and political problems that have plagued the project have not yet been resolved, the signing of the deal is a clear statement of intent by the four partners. According to a Reuters report, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat on September 20. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan will receive 5Mcm/d from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 14Mcm/d afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline will include a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Turkmenistan, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed another deal for the pipeline in December 2010. Russia signed an agreement in January 2011 with Afghanistan to help build the proposed TAPI gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. Although Russian involvement could boost the project's chances of going ahead, it undermines TAPI's aim of diversifying Central Asia's gas export routes away from Russia. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early-December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Macroeconomic Outlook Stellar Growth To Continue BMI View: 2011 is set to mark another year of stellar growth following 9% economic expansion in 2010. We hold to our forecast for 9% growth this year, driven by a burgeoning energy sector and ongoing diversification of export destinations. While foreign direct investment will remain focused on the oil and gas sector for the foreseeable future, the government will continue to channel energy export revenues to develop other sectors of the economy. Turkmenistan notched up an impressive growth rate of 9% in 2010 according to the State Committee of Turkmenistan, slightly above our expectation of 8%, and up from 6% in 2009. We expect this stellar growth to continue over the course of our forecast period, rising to 9% this year and peaking at 11% in 2016, marking Turkmenistan out as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the long run. Growth will continue to be driven by expansion of the energy sector, in particular, gas.Turkmenistan has the world's fourth largest gas reserves and gas exports are set to expand dramatically over the coming years as new capacity comes online. Continued diversification of export destinations will also help to bolster the energy sector's potential. While Russia remains Turkmenistan's main export partner, the government inaugurated new pipeline routes to China and Iran last year, and is set to increase export volumes to these economies rapidly over the coming years. Plans are also in motion to develop pipelines to India and Europe . While significant risks of delays to these projects exist, the country's diversification strategy will help to further reduce its dependence on Russia. Recycling Of Energy Revenues Foreign direct investment to develop the oil and gas sectors was reportedly as high as US$10bn in 2010 and we expect interest to continue picking up. Not only does Turkmenistan have vast untapped resources that will require foreign expertise and capital to develop, but President Berdymukhamedov has sought a more open and balanced foreign policy in the past two years. This has helped draw in foreign firms from around the world, most notably Asia and the Middle East, but also the US and Western Europe. This is a dynamic we expect to continue this year. That said, we do not expect similar levels of FDI to flow into the non-hydrocarbon sectors of the economy. It will likely remain incumbent on the government to recycle energy export revenues in order to expand these sectors. This has certainly paid dividends thus far, with the agriculture, pharmaceutical, textile and construction sectors all showing healthy growth rates in 2010. Development of these sectors Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 will nonetheless lag behind the oil and gas industry given the added efficiencies and expertise that come with foreign capital, which will, in turn, leave the country heavily dependent on commodity prices.

Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Competitive Landscape Executive Summary The main government vehicle is state-owned Turkmenneft. IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. Petronas began producing from the Diyarbakir field in 2006. Petronas production increased from 4,700b/d of oil in the financial year ending March 31 2008 to 6,400b/d in FY08-09. In February 2008 Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2009, Eni produced an average of 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2008. The largest minority investor in oil explorer Dragon Oil has rejected a takeover bid from controlling shareholder ENOC that valued Dragon at US$3bn. In 2009 Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea. Germanys RWE Dea in July 2009 announced that it signed a PSA to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. RWE will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities at the block between 2010 and 2014. The State Information Agency of Turkmenistan announced the start of production at the Yylakly field in the Central Karakum desert in early July 2009. First oil from the field, which was developed by subsidiaries of Turkmenneft, was transported to an oil facility around 65km south of the field, which was inaugurated on the same day. From there, the oil was sent by rail to the system of pipelines connected to the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries. Production is expected to reach a peak of 1,095b/d. The development of the Mydar field, also in the Central Karakum desert, is expected to start soon, with daily output expected to reach up to 2,555b/d of oil. State-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary reported in August 2008 that the South Gutlyayak field is producing some 200,000cm/d of gas and condensate, equal to 73Mcm per annum.

Source: BMI Licensing And Regulation In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been PSAs. The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields by mid-sized independents. Turkmenistan's energy ministry has said it will not invite foreign oil and gas explorers to invest in its onshore gas fields, Reuters reported in March 2011. External players will therefore only be allowed to carry out exploration and production in the country's sector of the Caspian Sea. They will, however, be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. Company 2009 Sales % share of total sales No. of employees Year Overview/State Role Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Government Policy President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn of cumulative investment in hydrocarbons sector by 2010, but the figure proved a serious overestimation. In 2010, the government believes it will receive US$4bn, up from US$2bn in 2009. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI at US$753mn. At least US$5bn per year over the next decade will need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMXs Jennifer Coolige argued there is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys policy not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be opening up under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya Basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. State-run Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. International Energy Relations Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan said in November 2009. This was not confirmed by Turkmen officials but in October 2010, government sources said Chervon and French major Total are negotiating their entrance into the Turkmen Caspian Shelf. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22, which provides for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010 an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has been aggressively pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 50 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 In 2008 Russia paid US$140 per thousand cubic metres for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May. During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late-2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. Although the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In January 2011 it was announced that Gazprom will buy around 38bcm of gas from Central Asian nations during 2011. This represents an increase of 2% y-o-y from about 38bcm in 2010. It is not clear how much of this will come from Turkmenistan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010 Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. An onward link to Tehran was completed by the Iranians in November 2010. The Dauletabad-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total Business Monitor International Ltd Page 51 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Iran has long been seen as a potential exporter of gas to Europe, or as a transit route for Central Asian gas. The completion of the second Turkmenistan-Iran gas pipeline makes this plan far more feasible. However, the main problems with the project have long been political rather than technological, with the EU currently opposed to Iranian gas imports. This stance appears to be justified by a US diplomatic communiqu released by website Wikileaks. According to the cable, Iran is interested in exporting gas to the EU in the belief that this will increase its political leverage and to help insulate it from sanctions. Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Tehran in February 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China The presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in December 2009 inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which covers a total of about 7,000km, transports gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008 Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO Business Monitor International Ltd Page 52 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110 Itera Turkmenistan-Russia. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. India and Turkmenistan have agreed to step up energy cooperation after high-level discussions during Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's first visit to India. The two sides expressed interest in several projects to transport Turkmen gas to India, including the long-mooted TAPI pipeline. However, BMI sees the political, security and technical challenges to the project as overwhelming making a gas-swap deal with Iran a more likely option. The proposed US$4bn TAPI pipeline would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan to India, which joined the project in 2008. Under a deal signed in Islamabad in April 2008, Afghanistan would receive 1bcm per year from the pipeline during the first two years of operation and 5bcm per year afterwards, with India and Pakistan to split the remaining capacity. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. TAPI was originally proposed in the mid-1990s by a US-led consortium but the project was placed on the back burner after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. While the war in Afghanistan has continued this has remained the case, and India and Pakistan's fractious relations have also stymied any further progress. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious TAPI pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy on November 24-25 2009. Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India signed an initial framework agreement for the TAPI pipeline in Ashgabat in September 2010. The four countries also signed an HoA for a proposed Gas Sales Purchase Agreement . India's junior oil minister Jitin Prasada, who led the Indian delegation, said that the success of the project depended on three main factors: low transit fees, the solution of security issues, and a final deal over gas pricing that is acceptable to all four countries. Turkmenistan, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed another deal for the pipeline in December 2010. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 53 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Russia signed an agreement in January 2011 with Afghanistan to help build the proposed TAPI gas pipeline. The move follows a report in India's Hindustan Times newspaper, citing senior Indian officials, which claimed that India was blocking the involvement of Chinese companies in the project. Although Russian involvement could boost the project's chances of going ahead, it undermines TAPI's aim of diversifying Central Asia's gas export routes away from Russia.

In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov.

In January 2008, Eni had secured 77% of Burren in an agreed GBP1bn. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In its 2010 annual report Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2009, suggesting its existing producing assets have reached a plateau. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Latest Developments Eni signed an MoU with Turkmenistans State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources to develop the Central Asian countrys energy industry, during an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Italy in November 2009. Following the visit, Scaroni also said that Eni was considering a new pipeline project under which it would export gas from Turkmenistan via Turkey to Italy. He said that this would be a separate project from the planned Nabucco and South Stream pipelines. During Scaronis visit to Ashgabat in early November 2009, he offered assistance for the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project, according to Turkmen government sources quoted by Reuters. In April 2008, Turkmenistan refused to issue entry visas to Enis managers, illustrating the governments irritation that it was not consulted about Enis takeover of Burrens assets. However, operations are said to be continuing as normal as former Burren employees that are now working for Eni are allowed to continue to travel in and out of the country, according to an Eni spokesperson. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 56 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies pursuing a steady drilling effort in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Substantial domestic oil producer Strong relationship with government Early entrance into and established position in market Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Lack of developed infrastructure Opportunities: Rise in regional oil and gas consumption Long-term export opportunities Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address Dragon Oil Plc, ENOC House IIThird Floor Right Wing Sheikh Rashid Road Dubai, UAE Tel: +971 4 305 3660 Fax: +971 4 335 6954 www.dragonoil.com Financial Statistics Revenues: US$780mn US$623mn US$706mn US$597mn US$325mn Net profit: US$386mn US$259mn US$369mn US$304mn US$187mn Operating Statistics Oil production: 47,211b/d 44,765b/d 40,992b/d 32,000b/d 20,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 57 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Market Position The Emirates National Oil Company , itself owned by the government of Dubai, holds a 52% share in London- and Dublin-listed Dragon Oil. The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of 8-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early-2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rising to a record 44,765b/d in 2009. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, down US$100mn from the 2009-2011 period. As of 2010 the company claims cumulative investment of US$1bn in the country. In late 2010 it announced plans to boost output to 75,000b/d, without specifying the projects involved. Dragon plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including five appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Latest Developments Dragon Oil's oil production hit 52,575b/d in December 2010. This was up 10% y-o-y, compared with 47,463b/d of oil production in December 2009. Average daily oil production in 2010 was up 5% y-o-y to 47,211b/d, compared with 44,765b/d in 2009. Production rose owing to the launch of new facilities and the removal of infrastructural bottlenecks. The companys reserves at its Turkmenistan field rose by 3% y-o-y to 639mn bbl of oil and condensate. Gas reserves at the field are 45bcm. Dragon completed initial testing of the Dzheitune 28/151 development well in early January 2011. A 14-inch in-field pipeline running from the Dzheitune B platform to the Dzheitune 28 platform has also been commissioned. The well, drilled to a total depth of 3,512m with the NIS rig, flowed at an initial combined rate of 2,656b/d of oil. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 58 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Dragon finished the first drilling and completion phase at two of its Caspian wells in November 2010. The Dzheitune B/148 and 28/149 development wells are part of a series to be drilled at the Dzheitune B platform offshore Turkmenistan. B/148 has been drilled to a depth of 3,858m and 28/149 reached a depth of 3,295m. In mid-May 2010, Dragon Oil issued details of contracts it had awarded to construct two rig platforms in its Cheleken contract area, in the Turkmen waters of the Caspian Sea. The company believes that the platforms, which will allow the drilling of up to 16 new wells, will help the company achieve its production targets. The Dzhygalybeg A platform, to be built by Q112, will support a land rig and a jack-up rig and will allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Zhdanov field. The Dzheitune C platform, to be built by Q411, will support a jack-up rig and allow the drilling of up to eight wells in the Lam Field. In April 2010, Dragon Oil announced that it had reached an agreement with a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company on a new short-term deal to replace a crude oil swap agreement that expired on 31 March 2010. The swap deal signed with NIOC subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company involves Dragon exporting its Turkmen crude to the Iranian Caspian port of Bandar Neka, where it is then marketed locally. In exchange, NIOC allocates Iranian crude oil to Dragon at the Kharg Island terminal, located in the Persian Gulf. Dragon Oil increased its 2009 full-year production by 9% to 44,765b/d of oil. The company put eight development wells into production in 2009. ENOCs takeover of Dragon Oil came to naught, with Dragon's largest minority shareholder rejecting the GBP4/share offer. Baillie Gifford & Co issued a statement on November 11 2009 claiming that the offer materially understates the fundamental and strategic value of Dragon Oil. Baillie Giffords clients holdings under its management amount to around 4% of the currently issued stock of Dragon, which is already 52% owned by ENOC. In August 2009, Dragon Oil released production test results from its Dzheitune 13/135 development well. The well was drilled to a depth of 3,302m and produced an initial flow rate of 1,320b/d of oil, which was slightly below Dragons expectations. The company said flows would improve, however, as the pressures in the gas-bearing zones are normalised. In June 2009, Dragon announced that it has successfully completed drilling the Dzheitune 28/134 development well, which was drilled to a total depth of 3,280m, using the Iran Khazar jackup rig. This well produced initial flow test rates of 2,685b/d and 869b/d of oil on long and short strings respectively. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 59 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Petronas Summary Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has told the Turkmen government that it could be producing up to 5bcm of gas from Block 1, with production expected to be increased to 10bcm at a later stage. Currently only oil is produced from the field. President Berdymukhamedov met Petronas former president, Hassan Marican, on May 15 2009 to discuss the companys Turkmenistan activities, according to Reuters. Petronas estimates that the field has 150bcm of reserves. In June 2009 Petronas said it would start installation work at Block 1 in early-2010. The facilities at the block will include a drilling platform, a wellhead platform and offshore pipelines. Offshore contractor Sigur Ros has signed a letter of intent to supply the crew and equipment required for the pipe laying work. First gas from the first phase of the block was scheduled for Q310 but appears to have been delayed. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. CNPC has reported what appears to be a major gas discovery in September 2010. CNPC reported that exploration well Oja-21 in Block B maintained a flow of 1mn Mcm/d of gas and 36cm/d of condensate during testing. The company has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bn bcm of reserves. PetroChina said in early September 2009 that it would pay US$1bn to its parent company CNPC for its share of the Amu Darya Right Bank gas field in Turkmenistan. The field, which is scheduled to come China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 60 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 onstream by the end of 2009, is earmarked to supply the second West-East gas pipeline that will transport gas to Shanghai. Gazprom Summary Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. In April 2003, the Russian and Turkmen presidents signed a bilateral cooperation agreement covering natural gas, which will remain in force from January 1 2004 until December 31 2028. Within the deal, state-controlled Turkmenneftegaz agreed a contract for the supply of Turkmen natural gas over the same period. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 in its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal on September 13 2009 with Turkmenistan to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which have been tense since April following an explosion on Itera Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 61 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite its dispute with Gazprom. Discussions on the project had been ongoing since February 18. By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its former partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for 16 years and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman Igor Makarov, this is the first time the company has been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Preliminary estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas a year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April when RWEs CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistans President Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which has been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3D seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. The company in April 2010 said it would invest US$60-80mn in the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said to have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan has continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. The deal is yet to materialise. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil has returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010 in response to earlier media reports. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall RWE Summary Others Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Canadian-registered independent Buried Hill Energy claimed that it signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan, confirmed to Reuters at the sidelines of a conference in the Central Asian country on November 18 2009. Turkmen officials have not confirmed whether they are holding talks with Chevron or any other foreign companies. Serbia's oil monopoly Naftna Industrija Srbije has won an upstream deal in Turkmenistan valued at US$33mn, the company said in a January 12 2011 statement quoted by Reuters. NIS will drill two 4,800m wells in the Akpatlauk oil field, two 3,800m wells in the Ekerem oil field and one 4,500m well in the Keimir oil field, all of which are being developed by state-run Turkmenneft. The project is expected to start in June 2011 and be completed by February 2012. Petrofac Among the Western firms, Petrofac has gained a major first mover advantage in Turkmenistan, winning a deal to develop the giant South Yolotan field on behalf of state-run Turkmengaz in 2009. In mid-2010, construction began on a new US$2bn pipeline, with 30bcm of capacity, connecting South Yolotan-Osman to Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast. Petrofac completed work on South Yolotan's first phase in December 2009, working as a contractor to state-run Turkmengaz. That contract was worth US$100mn. In the same month, Petrofac won a contract to undertake a FEED study and initial planning for the second phase infrastructure. South Yolotan represents Petrofac's sole ongoing Turkmen operation. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the project's US$3bn second phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. The second phase will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. Service Companies Business Monitor International Ltd Page 63 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Oil And Gas Outlook: Long-Term Forecasts Regional Oil Demand A slight strengthening of the 2010-2015 oil demand trend is predicted for the 2015-2020 period, reflecting the economic weakness prevailing in the earlier period, as well as the under-developed nature of several key economies, ongoing wealth generation thanks to rising export volumes, plus the maturing of new EU member states. The regions oil consumption is expected to increase by 13% in 2015-2020, after 13% growth in the period 2010-2015. Over the extended 2010 to 2020 forecast period, Azerbaijan leads the way, with oil demand increasing by an estimated 96%, followed by Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (+62%) and Kazakhstans 39% growth. Hungary lags the field, as a result of greater market maturity and the lack of hydrocarbons income that stimulates economies elsewhere in the region.

Cheap and plentiful local crude supplies help make it a region of choice for refinery investment, although government control of the downstream industry will need to be eased. Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, Turkey and Bulgaria have particularly ambitious expansion plans, reflecting either crude output growth or local demand expansion.

Gas production should rise from the estimated 2010 level of 65bcm to 140bcm by 2020, providing export potential increasing from an estimated 44bcm to 96bcm. Methodology And Risks To Forecasts In terms of oil and gas supply, as well as refining capacity, the projections are wherever possible based on known development projects, committed investment plans or stated government/company intentions. A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historical reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

Our approach has been threefold. First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all 16 industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline Oil & Gas BER is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of Upstream/Downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients, who will have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite for their operations. Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% Upstream BER and 50% Downstream BER: Upstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Upstream rating which is composed of limits/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Business Environment Rating: This is the overall Downstream rating which comprises limits/risks . Both the Upstream BER and Downstream BER are composed of Limits/Risks sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader Country Risk components: Limits of Potential Returns: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Ratings Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 71 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Risks to Realisation of those Returns: Evaluates both Industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Rule of Law Legal Framework Physical Infrastructure Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 75 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts BMI's industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 76 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q2 2011 Energy Industry There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy Supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: national energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; international quotas, guidelines and projections, such as OPEC, IEA, US Energy Information Administration . Energy Consumption A mixture of methods is used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historical relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts, based on company- or state-specific investment levels Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third-party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Cross Checks Sources Sources include those international bodies mentioned above, such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news agencies.

3ee1d4e6-2246-4ba5-b977-3e523ef63532,"News Stories and Documents June 1, 2012 The two men who embody the ongoing struggle for control over Chechnya and the North Caucasus both draw on Islamic theology, in particular the concept of jihad, to lend legitimacy to their efforts. But their approaches to doing so could not be more different. Pro-Moscow Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov has co-opted respected Islamic scholars to formulate a denunciation of the jihad espoused by the Islamic insurgency. That denunciation is intended to impress and convince by the weight of the theological arguments adduced. Self-styled Caucasus Emirate head and insurgency commander Doku Umarov, for his part, eschews doctrine, seeking instead to secure the support of his fellow Chechens by anchoring the concept of jihad in the Chechens' unequivocal rejection of Russian hegemony. The two camps do, however, agree on one key point, although their interpretations of it diverge: that jihad is a way to preserve and strengthen the Islamic faith. Following a recent congress in Moscow titled ""Islamic Doctrine Against Radicalism,"" prominent scholars from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere traveled to Grozny where they issued a declaration defining the terms ""jihad,"" ""takfir"" , and ""caliphate."" The declaration is intended in the first instance to substantiate legally and theologically the repeated assertions by Kadyrov and other republic heads that the North Caucasus insurgency has nothing in common with Islam. The declaration does not differentiate between the degrees of jihad. It affirms that the term applies strictly to bloodshed on the field of battle and that ""the killings, assassinations, and explosions perpetrated by fanatics in the Caucasus and other regions under the slogan of fighting against apostates, against those who distance themselves from Islam and are loyal to non-Muslims, which result in the deaths of Muslims and of those with regard to whom Shari'a law forbids bloodletting and the appropriation of their property, do not constitute jihad and have nothing in common with it."" As for ""takfir,"" the declaration says it is the exclusive prerogative of Allah, and even the most learned scholars do not have the right to level that accusation against a fellow believer. The insurgency's own theologians of jihad do not recognize any such constraints. But none of the theologians of the North Caucasus insurgency - Yasin Rasulov, Anzor Astemirov, Said Buriatsky, or the current qadi of the North Caucasus emirate, Sheikh Abu Mukhammad - has ever pronounced such an excommunication or even raised the possibility of doing so. Takfir is, however, common in Middle Eastern and Gulf countries, which may be why the authors of the declaration chose to include it. The declaration stresses the benefits of peaceful co-existence between adherents of various faiths and the need for Muslims to comply with the laws of the state in which they live. It terms impermissible ""aggressive actions"" against non-Muslim fellow citizens of that state. The declaration was clearly intended in the first instance to deter young Muslims from ""heading for the forest"" to join the insurgency ranks. The preamble says specifically that young people should approach its arguments positively and study them objectively, seriously and sincerely. Kadyrov himself was more explicit, saying he hopes ""radically oriented young people in Russia will heed the opinion of authoritative scholars of the Islamic world."" Umarov for his part recently issued twin appeals to the Muslims of Chechnya and of the North Caucasus and Russia in which he speaks in very simple language of the history and essence of jihad and reminds them of their obligation to participate in it. Those appeals, filmed in April, are the first Umarov has made since February 2011. Now, as then, Umarov argued forcefully that jihad is obligatory for all believers and constitutes the most effective medication for the various ills from which the Umma is collectively suffering. But in other respects his tone this year was generally more conciliatory than in 2011. In his address to his fellow Chechens, Umarov links jihad not just with upholding the faith but with the obligation to preserve control over ""this beautiful land of Chechnya that Allah has given us,"" because ""Muslims must be masters of their land."" Umarov goes on to differentiate between jihad and wahhabism, arguing that they are not one and the same thing. He traces the history of jihad in Chechnya back to Djokhar Dudayev, the secular nationalist first president of the Chechen Republic Ichkeria, but admits that Dudayev's ""initial statements and slogans were different."" Umarov went on to conflate the1944 deportation of the Chechens and Ingush to Central Asia, and also "" , with jihad, without explaining the logic of his argument. Umarov twice stressed that the younger generation of insurgents in Chechnya are fighting not out of mercantile considerations but to preserve the religion of Allah. Umarov then apologized ""if we have caused offense in any way"" and begged for forgiveness and also for the help and support of his fellow Chechens, or at least their prayers. Umarov went on to warn the Chechens not to be deceived and seduced by the pro-Moscow Chechen leadership's construction of mosques and infrastructure, saying that those who sell out to that leadership are destined for perdition. In the shorter address to the Muslims of the Caucasus and Russia, Umarov similarly appealed to them not to remain indifferent to the sufferings of their fellow believers, stressing that innocent civilians are being killed weekly in the Caucasus. Umarov also warned President Vladimir Putin and other members of the Russian leadership that they will never destroy the Chechen fighters' commitment to victory and independence. Umarov identifies as the ultimate objective of jihad imposing Shari'a law and securing for the Chechen people freedom and control over the land on which they live. But he does not explicitly equate those twin goals with the Caucasus Emirate. Indeed, he does not use that term in either address. Instead, he speaks in the name of the Chechen fighters. That failure to mention the Caucasus Emirate, which the U.S. State Department last year designated a terrorist organization, raises the question whether Umarov is seeking either to placate the senior Chechen commanders who rebelled against him two years ago, or to secure the support of the long-suffering Chechen population, or both. The pro-Moscow Chechen leadership routinely engages in vicious reprisals against the families of insurgents and anyone suspected of helping them. That Umarov's virtual Caucasus Emirate remains a hot-button issue for Moscow is clear, however, from the Russian Foreign Ministry's aggrieved reaction to a conference held in Istanbul in mid-May that adopted a formal declaration proclaiming the Caucasus Emirate the sole lawful authority in the Caucasus and extending greeting to Umarov and his fighters. The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador to lodge a protest, stressing the potential negative impact on bilateral relations from condoning events whose participants ""threaten Russia's territorial integrity and the security of its citizens.""

23f2035c-3f37-458e-8e6d-4076cb4bd758,"Russia's privately-owned national television channel REN has expressed openly anti-American views in an editorial report reminiscent of anti-Western state TV commentator Mikhail Leontyev's Odnako features on Channel One TV, and urged Moscow to challenge the US' positions in world politics. Presenter Andrey Dobrov's report, in late evening news on 18 January, echoed some of Russian state TV's familiar grievances and views concerning the United States and praised Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's ""balanced"" foreign policy as a way of taking over America's role as the ""moderator of world politics"". Journalist Maksim Shevchenko, a regular contributor on Gazprom-owned, editorially-independent Ekho Moskvy radio and the presenter of Channel One TV's judge for yourselves programme, expressed similar views in a post which appeared on the Ekho Moskvy website on the same day. Shevchenko said that the United States was a modern day Rome trying to ""disintegrate"" Russia from within, while Russia was a ""historical antithesis to Rome"", which should beat the United States at its own game and set up a ""union of free nations"". This line of thought appeared in Dobrov's commentary as well. He accused America of strangling nations in its ""deadly embraces"" and ""squeezing oil"" out of its defeated opponents , said that Washington played a role in Georgia's ""attack on South Ossetia"" and is now ""encircling"" Russia with its missile defences. Europe no longer wants US as moderator of world politics Dobrov argued that having left ""stains"" of blood and oil behind them ""in various regions of the world"", the Americans had alienated even their European allies who no longer wanted Washington as the moderator of world politics. He claimed that America's standing in Europe was further damaged following the ""decision"" in 2008 for ""everyone to help the States"" address the consequences of the credit crunch, the decision which he claimed led to eurozone countries being particularly economically vulnerable now. ""European leaders understand this full well,"" and ""do not want to disrupt the economic ties that either have already been established with our country or can be set up in these difficult times,"" said Dobrov. No wonder, he observed, that European leaders ""have remained silent"" about Russia's parliamentary election, while the Americans have been very critical. Moscow has chance to take over Dobrov said that US policies presented Moscow with a good opportunity to take over the role of the moderator: ""Russia, as the only superpower with European history, as a country that emerged from the last crisis with even smaller losses than Europe, could quite possibly assume the functions of such moderation in the future, but only if it retains its balanced policy."" US ambassador a Roman procurator Shevchenko's post was a reaction to Russian opposition figures' meeting with Washington's news ambassador in Moscow, Michael McFaul. Predictably, he was very unsympathetic towards the opposition, who he said wished Russia's disintegration, but said that he would not ""demonize McFaul as a specialist in orange revolutions"". ""He does not give the impression of a man who hates our country. He simply is an American, and as every honest American is serving the interests of his empire. It is in the interests of his empire to break up the Russian Federation, disintegrate it and create in its place many small ethnic states dependant on Washington's will."" ""McFaul is trying to behave as Pontius Pilate, as Rome's procurator. Why should we be demanding that he not serve Rome's interests?"" Russia - antithesis of Rome Instead, Shevchenko said, Russia's response should be to ""free ourselves from the utopia of Rome and set up a union of free nations"". ""Russia is a historical antithesis to Rome... and our leader from the past is Attila, an educated person, who spoke six languages, who studied in Rome as a young man and went on to destroy the world's dungeon, Rome,"" he said. Shevchenko argued that ""we will disappear if we do not mount a spiritual challenge, if we do not say why we do not want to be Rome. Why we do not want to be governed by officials that emulate Rome and its manners"". He said that ""we should organize a union of free peoples who have other values. Not the values of serving a big great city, whatever it is called, but completely different, spiritual values."" ""Our peoples - Russian, Caucasian Turkic - have values that are worth living for and dying for, values that oppose the values of Rome."" Use ""orange technologies"" against America Shevchenko said that rather than fearing ""orange technologies"" , Russia should apply them to its opponents. ""The USA can be plunged into chaos. A revolution is far more possible there than in Russia,"" he said, arguing that ""there are plenty of people in the USA who would have been happy if Russia went back to supporting their fight against American imperialism - blacks, Indians, left-wing people, far right, in other words, all sorts of people"". He also suggested that Russia ought to ""support Iran, arm Iran, supply it with S-300 air defence systems, supply it with anti-ship Rapira missiles, arm Syria, arm the Palestinian resistance movement, support armed opposition in Afghanistan, recognize Taleban movement, demand that But be freed and support the FARC insurgents, let them stage a red colour revolution against the USA in a key Caribbean country. Trust me, the problem of an orange revolution will then disappear from Russia by itself.""

Page 4 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 BMI Industry View BMI View: Turkmenistan could potentially benefit from a gas export bonanza, with a major reserves upgrade at the South Yolotan field alone providing the basis for long-term supply agreements that should transform the economic outlook. There are technical and commercial hurdles to overcome, but timely infrastructure investment and moves to improve international relations should guarantee that Turkmenistan becomes a key player in global gas supply. The main trends and developments we highlight for Turkmenistans Oil and Gas sector are: Turkmenistan's South Yolotan gas field has been confirmed as the world's second largest after an appraisal by auditor Gaffney, Cline & Associates . The field is thought to contain 13-21trn cubic metres of natural gas. The former Soviet Republic currently holds the world's fourth-largest natural gas reserves and plans to treble annual gas output to 230bn cubic metres by 2030, of which it would export 180bcm. According to Cedigaz data, in 2010, China received 3bcm of gas from Turkmenistan. Ashgabat has indicated that supplies could have risen to 17bcm in 2011 and should climb further to 20bcm in 2012. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13 2011. The two countries are in negotiations over a long-term contract to supply 60bcm per year to China, although little progress has been made on final terms. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 65bcm in 2011 to 95bcm by 2016, with a further substantial increase in supply expected by the end of the decade as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 24bcm to 34bcm during the period to 2016, with exports set to reach almost 61bcm. By 2021, Turkmenistan is likely to be exporting more than 100bcm. The government is targeting higher production. However, the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals owing to a shift to gas production and lagging foreign investment. According to reports in 2007, Turkmenistan aimed to produce 2mn barrels per day by 2030. Although this target has been reduced to 1mn b/d by 2030, according to an unnamed source speaking to Reuters in March 2011, we still see this output target as rather optimistic. BMI forecasts 2012 oil production averaging 216,000b/d, rising to 345,000b/d by 2016. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand will have been an estimated 125,000b/d in 2011 and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI forecasts demand to increase to 159,000b/d by 2016, leaving export potential of up to 186,000b/d. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 5 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 At time of writing, we assume an OPEC basket oil price for 2011 of US$101per barrel , falling to US$99/bbl in 2012. Global GDP in 2011 is forecast at 3%, down from 4% in 2010, reflecting slowing growth in China, a faltering recovery in the US and a worsening eurozone debt crisis. For 2012, growth is put at 3%. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 6 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 SWOT Analysis Turkmenistan Oil and Gas SWOT Strengths Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 108,000b/d in 1997 to more than 200,000b/d during 2003. Output then slipped to 186,000b/d in 2006, before rebounding to an estimated 206,000b/d in 2011. Turkmenistan has proven natural gas reserves of approximately 8,400bcm, ranking it among the worlds top five countries. The South Yolotan field could more than double these reserves. Weaknesses All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. Relations between Ashgabat and Moscow soured following a disagreement in April 2009 over an explosion on the pipeline that transports gas from Turkmenistans Dauletabad field to Russia via Uzbekistan. Opportunities Turkmenistan has been renewing diplomatic relations with Russia, China, Europe, the US and other Central Asian neighbours. Many IOCs had earlier experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, there have been signs that a more IOC-friendly environment is again attracting foreign partners. Turkmenistan's South Yolotan gas field has been confirmed as the world's second- largest after an appraisal by auditor Gaffney, Cline & Associates. The field is thought to contain 13-21tcm of gas. Threats Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Global Energy Market Outlook The BMI global oil supply and demand assumptions for 2011 and beyond have been revisited again, reflecting changes in the oil market and broader macroeconomic trends. H211 saw much of the markets focus shift from concerns over supply, following the loss of Libyan volumes in February, to worries over the demand outlook, as macroeconomic conditions worsened across Western and emerging economies. In our view, the focus on demand-side dynamics will continue over the rest of 2011 and into 2012 as macroeconomic weakness feeds through into oil demand. We have downgraded our 2011 US real GDP growth forecast to 2% from 2% and the medium-term outlook offers little hope for a strong recovery. We expect even slower growth in the eurozone of around 1% and we see mounting risks to growth in China. There is already evidence that worsening macroeconomic conditions and demand destruction resulting from high oil prices have started to hit oil consumption. In the US, we now forecast that liquids consumption will grow by just 0% in 2011, compared to a growth rate of 2% in 2010. With signs that a disappointing summer driving season in the US is carrying on into the autumn, risks to this forecast are firmly to the downside, with potential for demand to actually shrink. The demand outlook for 2012 is only slightly higher at 0%, again with risk to the downside if macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate. While growth has disappointed in Western economies, demand remained robust in emerging economies over H111, more than making up for slower-than-expected consumption in the West. China, of course, has been driving emerging market demand. However, government measures to counter inflation and address pollution concerns by limiting car sales and raising fuel prices look to be taking hold. Demand, although still robust, started to slow in the June and July and continued to fall in August. Apparent oil demand grew by 7% year-on-year to 8mn barrels/day . While those are strong numbers, 8mn b/d was the lowest figure since October 2010 and the underlying growth trend is showing signs of slowing. With government efforts to rein in inflation and address environmental concerns set to continue, we expect further deceleration in consumption growth through to the end of 2011 and into early 2012. However, even with a weakening demand outlook, supply in the market remains very tight. Our forecasts show the global market running at a supply deficit of about 1mn b/d for 2011. The primary factor behind this deficit is Libya; but production from Latin America, the UK North Sea and Emerging Europe has also disappointed. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 The Libya Effect Global Oil Supply And Demand, 000b/d e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical, EIA; Estimates/Forecasts, BMI In the UK, rising investment levels have not been able to stem a faster-than-expected decline in production, which fell below 1mn b/d in June 2011 for only the second time in 30 years. The effect has been magnified as the market has looked to the North Seas light sweet crude to replace lost light sweet volumes from Libya. In Azerbaijan, extended maintenance at BPs ACG oil field is likely to cause production to disappoint by around 100,000b/d relative to expected volumes. Moreover, Azeri authorities have warned that production is likely to fall lower into 2012 and production has also been worse than expected in Latin America. Disappointing output volumes in Brazil and Venezuela have led us to lower our 2011 output target for the region by around 200,000b/d. Supply tightness is expected to ease going into 2012, but the market is not expected to produce a surplus until 2013. We forecast a supply deficit of around 860,000b/d, which will persist into 2012, with the market finally moving back into surplus in 2013. Libya, however, remains a wildcard. Our forecast is based on the assumption that limited oil supplies of around 300,000b/d primarily from the Messla and Sarir fields in the southeast of the country will come back onstream before the end of 2011. The next stage of bringing production back onstream will likely see flows restart from the offshore Bouri field and the Eni-operated El Sharara field in the Murzuk Basin near the Algerian border. If those fields are successfully brought back onstream, we see potential output rising to as much as 1mn b/d by the end of 2012. More challenging will be restarting production at Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 fields in the Sirte Basin, which sustained damage during the civil war. If that is successful, full pre-war production of 1mn b/d could be realised again by early 2013. There are, however, a number of risks to this outlook. First and foremost will be the security situation. The country will need an army of foreign oil workers to get the industry back on its feet and that will require a stable security environment. Another risk is potential damage to oil facilities and reservoirs. Although some oil companies have visited their facilities, it remains unclear how extensive damage from attacks and looting has been at production and transport infrastructure. There is also virtually nothing known about potential unseen damage caused to oil reservoirs as workers fleeing the fighting hastily shutdown production without following normal well-management procedures. In spite of those risks, the end of the civil war, and the prospect of substantial volumes of Libyan oil flooding back onto international markets, are major positives for the supply and demand balance outlook.

The 2011 forecast reflects slow Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development demand growth of 0%, and strong non-OECD consumption growth of 3%.

The primary difference is in our anticipationof slightly positive OECD demand growth. Short-Term Supply Outlook According to the revised BMI model, 2011 global oil production will rise by 1%. OPEC has taken steps to make up for lost Libyan volumes and as a result we actually see OPEC production coming in about 0% higher in 2011 than in 2010, primarily due to increased output from Saudi Arabia. Non-OPEC supply growth projected to be 1%, moderately higher than in 2010 but not high enough to make up for a global supply shortfall.

Rising production from OPEC countries such as Nigeria, Angola and Venezuela will mean that OPEC countries will play the primary role in boosting global output through to 2015. Average production growth for OPEC is 4%, compared to 2% for non-OPEC countries. Meanwhile, non-OECD countries will continue to be the primary drivers of rising global consumption, with an average growth rate of 3%, compared to an average consumption growth rate of under 2% in OECD countries. Beyond the supply tightness of 2011 and 2012, BMI sees production comfortably outstripping demand on the back of sharply rising production in countries such as Brazil and Venezuela in Latin America, as well as Nigeria and Angola in Africa. We forecast global oil supply to increase by 2% annually between 2011 and 2015.

Many international oil companies had experienced numerous political challenges, with several abandoning the country. Since the arrival of President Berdymukhamedov, a more IOC-friendly environment has again attracted foreign partners, although some have moved out of the country after unsuccessful exploration efforts. However, in March 2011, the countrys Energy Ministry, cited by Reuters, announced that it would not invite foreign oil companies to explore its onshore gas fields, although they would be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. Foreign companies hoping to carry out exploration will therefore be limited to Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan contains several of the world's biggest gas fields, located primarily in the AmuDarya Basin in the east, and the Murgab Basin and the South Caspian Basin in the west. All existing major gas fields in Turkmenistan have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. The South Yolotan gas field has been confirmed as the world's second largest after an appraisal by auditor Gaffney, Cline & Associates . The field is thought to contain 13tcm-21tcm of natural gas. A previous GCA estimate, made in 2008, put reserves at 4tcm-14tcm. According to GCA Business Development Manager Jim Gillett, 'the current estimated data for both South Yolotan and Yashlar may well increase still further as additional data are acquired'. The flagship field will be central to Ashgabat's plans to become a gas supplier to markets in Europe and East Asia. The former Soviet Republic currently holds the world's fourth-largest natural gas reserves and plans to treble annual gas output to 230bcm by 2030, of which it would export 180bcm. South Yolotan is set to supply a large portion of this increase. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. However, Turkmenistan has been pursuing a strategy of gas export diversification and in 2009/2010 it inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The inauguration of the China pipeline in December 2009 marked the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 According to Cedigaz data, in 2010, China received 3bcm of gas from Turkmenistan. Ashgabat has indicated that supplies could have risen to 17bcm in 2011 and should climb further to 20bcm in 2012. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13. The two countries are in negotiations over a long-term contract to supply 60bcm per year to China, although little progress has been made on final terms. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998, as Russia denied the country access to its export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. We expect production volumes to have picked up significantly to around 65bcm in 2011. In November 2011, Turkmenistan and Pakistan were expected to sign an agreement over the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. An official source said both the countries had already agreed on the gas sale price of US$360 per million cubic metres at the Turkmenistan Afghanistan border after factoring in a deduction of US$29/Mcm to cover transit and transportation cost through Afghanistan. The pipeline is expected to start supplying gas by December 2016, but that depends upon Afghanistan providing credible security cover, Afghanistan will receive 5bcm of gas, out of total planned supply of 33bcm per annum. The US$4bn TAPI scheme would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Many of the prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on maritime borders these fields will likely remain undeveloped. IOC-based joint ventures and production sharing agreements with Turkmenneft, the state-owned oil company, have typically been concentrated on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields targeted by mid-sized independents. UK-based Burren Energy is now owned by Italys Eni group. Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . A third 50,000b/d refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. Turkmenistans refinery system is under-utilised and processing represents around half of nameplate capacity. The Turkmenbashi refinery was upgraded in 2002, and in 2004 the Turkmen government announced plans to upgrade the Seidi refinery, which only processes high-sulphur crude.

Most of the countrys oil fields are situated in the South Caspian Basin and the Garashyzlyk onshore area in the west of the country. The EIA, on which BMIs forecasts are based, takes a more moderate view, assigning no more than 600mn bbl to the country in 2010. We are assuming a steady decline in oil reserves as production rises, with around 565mn bbl remaining by 2016. All existing major gas fields have been producing for more than 20 years and are showing signs of depletion. The Turkmen government wants to produce offshore associated gas reserves from its section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan's South Yolotan gas field has been confirmed as the world's second largest after an appraisal by auditor GCA. The field is thought to contain 13tcm-21tcm of gas. A previous GCA estimate, made in 2008, put reserves at 4tcm-14tcm. According to GCA Business Development Manager Jim Gillett, 'the current estimated data for both South Yolotan and Yashlar may well increase still further as additional data are acquired'. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan by 2020, a company executive told Reuters on April 14 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 at its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. State-run China National Petroleum Corporation has made a major gas discovery in Turkmenistan, according to a September 2010 Reuters report. CNPC has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bcm of reserves. 2009 2010 2011f 2012f 2013f 2014f 2015f 2016f 28,822 30,113 LNG Net Exports, bcm 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0LNG Price, US$/mn btu 911151414131313 e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical, BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2010; Forecast, BMI Oil And Gas Reserves Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Oil Supply And Demand Oil production has rebounded since Turkmenistan obtained independence from the Soviet Union, increasing from 85,000b/d in 1994 to 210,000b/d during 2004. Output then slipped to 176,000b/d in 2006, but will have rebounded to an estimated 206,000b/d in 2011. Turkmen producer Dragon Oil expects its oil production to reach 100,000b/d by 2015, according to CEO Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa. This represents an annual increase of 10-15% over the next four years. The company aims to maintain this production rate for at least five years, according to Khalifa. Dragon forecast production of 70,000b/d of oil by end-2011. The government is targeting higher production, but the oil sector is struggling to meet its growth goals owing to a shift to gas production and lagging foreign investment. According to reports in 2007, Turkmenistan aimed to produce 2mn b/d by 2030. Although this target has been reduced to 1mn b/d by 2030, according to an unnamed source speaking to Reuters in March 2011, we still see that output target as rather optimistic. BMI forecasts 2012 oil production averaging 216,000b/d, rising to 345,000b/d by 2016. The country exports roughly half of its production. Local demand will have been an estimated 125,000b/d in 2011 and is subsidised by the Turkmen government. BMI forecasts demand to increase to 159,000b/d by 2016, leaving export potential of up to 186,000b/d. Turkmenistan Oil Production, Consumption And Imports e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical, Energy Information Administration; Estimates/Forecasts, BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Gas Supply And Demand Consultant GCA has said that it would recommend the gradual development of the Osman-South Yolotan field, increasing production by 10bcm a year, with the maximum production capacity at the field estimated at 70bcm. While GCA has not commented on how quickly the field could be brought onstream, the suggested output levels would significantly add to the countrys production volumes. The recent CGA upgrade to the reserves estimate for South Yolotan may have implications for ultimate productive capacity. UK-based services firm Petrofac has begun work on the second phase of the South Yolotan scheme. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the US$3bn phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. It will require the provision of engineering, procurement and commissioning work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year. In July 2011, Petronas of Malaysia began to deliver gas from its Block-1 interests, with Turkmenistan purchasing the gas for resale to Russia and other buyers. The head of Turkmenistan's State Agency on Management of Hydrocarbon Resources, Yagshigeldy Kakayev, said that production would reach 5bcm per year during the first phase of development, rising to 10bcm at an unspecified date. Pricing disputes with Russia meant that Turkmenistans gas production fell sharply in the 1990s, with peak output of 79bcm in 1991 tumbling to just 12bcm in 1998, as Russia denied the country access to its export pipelines. Volumes recovered to 66bcm in 2008, with Turkmenistan supplying countries such as Ukraine via Russia-owned pipelines. In 2009, fresh disagreements led to a dramatic reduction in gas supply to just 36bcm. We expect production volumes to have picked up only slightly to around 42bcm in 2010. Our forecasts assume that gas output will increase from an estimated 65bcm in 2011 to 95bcm by 2016, with a further substantial increase in supply expected by the end of the decade as the new fields enter production. Domestic demand is expected to rise from an estimated 24bcm to 34bcm during the period to 2016, so exports could reach almost 62bcm by the end of the period. By 2021, Turkmenistan is likely to be exporting more than 100bcm. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 25 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Turkmenistan Gas Production, Consumption And Imports e/f = estimate/forecast; Source: Historical, Energy Information Administration; Estimates/Forecasts, BMI Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . Originally designed to process Russian crudes, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced the two plants to use local crudes as feedstock. A third refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. This 50,000b/d plant also processes local light sweet crudes sourced from Dragon Oil's Cheleken Contract Area in the Black Sea. In order to increase refining capacity, Turkmenistan is reportedly looking into expanding both of the state-owned plants and adding three new refineries. According to an unnamed government official cited by Reuters in March 2011, Turkmenistan wants to increase capacity at each refinery to 9mn tpa, equivalent to 180,000b/d each. He did not say when the expansion projects would take place. He also claimed that the country also plans to build a third state-owned refinery in the Balkan Province near Dragon Oil's facility by 2025. A further two refineries are planned by 2030 in the eastern regions of Mary and Akhai. Refining And Oil Products Trade Business Monitor International Ltd Page 26 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 With a combined capacity of around 240,000b/d, these three greenfield refineries would likely be smaller than the two existing state-owned plants. The official did not specify whether the three new refineries would also be state owned. Nevertheless, he claimed that the government plans to launch international tenders for the plants, in a move that could create opportunities for oil and gas construction companies such as Technip, KBR, and WorleyParsons, all of which have worked on projects in Turkmenistan. In March 2011, an unnamed source, cited by Reuters, said that Turkmenistan planned to increase refining volumes to 400,000b/d by 2020, to 440,000b/d by 2025 and to 600,000b/d by 2030. In BMI's view these highly ambitious refining targets are unlikely to be achieved. Without any indications of any of these projects actually going ahead, we have not included the expansions in our current forecasts. The picture for oil export revenues is relatively bright. Turkmenistan should have earned an estimated US$3bn from crude in 2011, but could be generating oil export revenues of US$6bn by 2016. The potential gas export revenues generated in 2016 are US$28bn. For combined oil and gas revenues, the 2016 total could be US$34bn, against an estimated US$23bn in 2011. The revenue picture painted above owes much to rising output and relatively high oil prices. There is clearly a risk of slippage in terms of oil and gas volumes, with gas capable of surprising on the downside over the near term. Export levels are also dependent on adequate infrastructure investment. In terms of the oil price, sensitivity is clearly on the rise, as are higher export volumes. At a flat US$50/bbl oil price from now until 2016, petroleum export revenues would rise to US$18bn. However, at a flat US$100/bbl, 2016 export revenues would be US$36bn. Revenues/Import Costs Key Risks To BMIs Forecast Scenario Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Oil And Gas Infrastructure Oil Refineries Turkmenistan has three refineries, with total capacity of 287,000b/d. Two Soviet-era plants are located at the Caspian Sea port of Turkmenbashi and Trkmenabat in the eastern Lebap Province on the Uzbekistan border . Originally designed to process Russian crudes, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced the two plants to use local crudes as feedstock. A third refinery, constructed by UAE-based Dragon Oil, came onstream in March 2007 in the Caspian Sea town of Hazar. This 50,000b/d plant also processes local light sweet crudes sourced from Dragon Oil's Cheleken Contract Area in the Black Sea. In order to increase refining capacity, Turkmenistan is reportedly looking into expanding both of the state-owned plants and adding three new refineries. According to an unnamed government official cited by Reuters in March 2011, Turkmenistan wants to increase capacity at each refinery to 9mn tpa, equivalent to 180,000b/d each. The official did not say when the expansion projects would take place.

Without any indications of any of these projects actually going ahead, we have not included the expansions in our current forecasts. Oil and oil products are exported from Turkmenistan by sea from the Kenar, Aladzha and Ekerem terminals. The throughput capacity of Kenar is 22mn bbl per year and it can accommodate tankers with a deadweight of up to 5,000 tonnes, while the Aladzha terminal has a throughput capacity of up to 17mn bbl of oil per year. Oil Storage Facilities The countrys main oil storage depot at Zerger was expanded in 2006 from a capacity of 124,666 bbl to its current capacity of 161,332 bbl. Oil Terminals/Ports Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 The Ekerem terminals throughput capacity is 8mn bbl of crude oil per year and the facility is capable of loading tankers of up to 7,000 deadweight tonnes. There are plans to make Ekerem the second largest marine port in Turkmenistan. There are three small pipelines that transport oil from fields near the countrys Caspian coastline to the refinery in Turkmenbashi. There are pipeline routes from the offshore Bank Lam oil and gas field, the Kum Dag oil field and Okarem field. East-West Interconnector Pipeline May 2010, saw the launch of construction of the so-called East-West pipeline, which will run 1,000km from the South Yolotan-Osman field in the south-east of the country to the port of Turkmenbashi. For part of the route the East-West pipeline will follow the course of an existing pipeline running from the Dauletabad field to Turkmenbashi via Ashgabat. According to Berdymukhamedov, the East-West pipeline will cost US$2bn and will be built exclusively by domestic companies. Its capacity has been set at 30bcm per annum and construction is scheduled for completion in 2015. The pipeline will play a critical role in gas exports, allowing gas to be transported to different export destinations according to market conditions and preferences. It is seen as vital part of plans for eventual exports to Europe as Turkmenistan looks to diversify away from Russia. While gas exports to Europe are a possibility, pre-requisites include the resolution of Caspian Sea maritime border disputes and the construction of a subsea pipeline, neither of which BMI sees as likely in the short term. Given CNPC's investment in South Yolotan, eastward gas exports to China are set to rise in the coming years. Turkmenistan-Iran Turkmenistan now has two gas export pipelines to Iran. The first, the 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline, was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. The Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The new 12bcm supply line from the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran was inaugurated in December 2009. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. In April 2010, the Iranian Gas Transmission Company 's Managing Director Mostafa Kashkuli told the state-affiliated Islamic Republic News Agency that the country hoped to add over 4bcm of Turkmen gas import capacity by the end of 2010, through the extension of the Dauletabad- Khangeran pipeline. The second leg of the pipeline runs from the Shahid Hasheminejad refinery in the city of Oil Pipelines Gas Pipelines Business Monitor International Ltd Page 29 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Khangeran to the inner north-eastern Razavi Khorasan province. The second phase was completed at the end of 2010, bringing capacity to around 16bcm. Kashkuli said that eventually the Dauletabad-Khangeran pipeline would carry up to 18bcm. Central Asian Gas Pipeline in December 2009, the presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which will stretch a total of about 7,000km, will transport gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marked the launch of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines, which start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. However, actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. China imported more than 5bcm of gas from Turkmenistan in the first five months of 2011, according to a China Petroleum Daily article cited by Reuters on June 13 2011. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Central Asia-Center Until recently, the Soviet-era Central Asia-Center line to Russia was Turkmenistans sole export trunkline. Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia in January 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on CAC in April 2009. Gas exports have resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22 2009 for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters in February 2009. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. While the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India In November 2011, Turkmenistan and Pakistan were expected to sign an agreement over the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. An official source said both the countries had already agreed on the gas sale price of US$360/Mcm at the Turkmenistan Afghanistan border, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 factoring in a deduction of US$29/Mcm to account for transit and transportation costs through Afghanistan. The pipeline is expected to start gas supply by December 2016, but that depends upon Afghanistan providing credible security cover. Afghanistan will also receive 5bcm of gas, out of total planned supply of 33bcm per annum. The US$4bn TAPI scheme would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border. Nabucco In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early-December 2009 that Turkmenistan had continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. In January 2011, EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Regional and Country Risk/Reward Ratings Central Eastern Europe Region The Central/Eastern Europe region comprises 15 countries, including the new EU member states, Russia and the four leading Central Asian hydrocarbons producers. State influence remains very high, and is arguably increasing in both Russia and Kazakhstan. There has been widespread privatisation progress in the EU states, but far less movement in the other key states. Kazakhstans moves to take a bigger share of the Kashagan project and to modify licensing laws are, we hope, an isolated example, although Russian tax tweaks, environmental claims and attempted asset re-nationalisation have undermined its already unattractive licensing and regulatory regime.

Industr y Rewar ds Country Rewards Rewards Industry Risks Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Turkmenistan Upstream Rating Overview Contributing to Turkmenistans relatively impressive showing in the regional upstream risk/rewards ratings are particularly high scores for gas reserves, oil and gas production growth potential and the gas reserves/production ratio. The countrys generally unattractive risk profile provides little investor protection. Industry Rewards: Turkmenistan is particularly strong in the areas of hydrocarbon reserves, production and the domestic supply growth outlook. Country Rewards: Turkmenistan has a poor Country Rewards rating. The state plays a significant role in the ownership of upstream assets, and the industry is only faintly competitive. Industry Risks: Turkmenistan performs badly in terms of risk. The country achieves a low score for Industry Risks because of its regulatory and licensing environment, and the fact that there is significant state ownership of upstream assets. Country Risks: Turkmenistans broader Country Risks environment is unattractive. The states low scores for corruption, rule of law and physical infrastructure weaken its overall performance. Continuity of policy across governments reduces the operational risks for private companies.

Industry Rewards Industry Risks Country Country Rewards Rewards Risks Risks Turkmenistan Downstream Rating Overview Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Competitive Landscape Executive Summary The main government vehicle is state-owned Turkmenneft. IOC involvement is limited, and generally in partnership with Turkmenneft. Key partners are Eni-owned Burren Energy, Malaysias Petronas and UAE-backed Dragon Oil. Petronas began producing from the Diyarbakir field in 2006. In July 2011, it started up an onshore gas terminal and gas processing plant on Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast, in order to allow production to begin from its offshore Block-1 assets. Although gas from the block will initially be sent to Russia, over the long term exports to Europe are still possible. In February 2008, Eni completed the acquisition of Burren Energy. In 2010, Eni produced an average of 12,000b/d of oil in Turkmenistan, the same level as in 2009. In 2010, Dragon produced around 20% of Turkmenistans total oil production, contributing around 47,200b/d. Dragons principal development and production interest is located in the Cheleken Contract Area in the Caspian Sea. Dragon expects its oil production to reach 100,000b/d by 2015, according to CEO Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa. In July 2009, Germanys RWE Dea announced that it had signed a PSA to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. RWE will invest US$60-80mn in exploration activities at the block between 2010 and 2014. The State Information Agency of Turkmenistan announced the start of production at the Yylakly field in the Central Karakum desert in early July 2009. First oil from the field, which was developed by subsidiaries of Turkmenneft, was transported to an oil facility around 65km south of the field, then to the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries. State-run news agency Turkmen Khabarlary reported in August 2008 that the South Gutlyayak field is producing some 200,000 cubic metres of gas and condensate per day, equal to 73Mcm per annum.

Source: BMI In March 2007, the government established a hydrocarbons regulatory authority, the State Agency for Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, which is separate from the central government and is designed to provide greater revenue transparency and initiate more foreign investment. This body is responsible for licensing, contract negotiations and monitoring foreign operations. While this body is responsible for carrying out these duties, central control remains strong and President Berdymukhamedov ultimately shapes the countrys oil and gas policies. The Petroleum Law of Turkmenistan governs the countrys licensing regime and regulates petroleum-related activity. In order to carry out petroleum-related activities a company must first obtain a licence for exploration only, production only, or combined exploration and production, and sign a contract with the regulatory authority. The contract covers nearly all aspects of petroleum operations as well as commercial and taxation matters. Licences are granted by the regulatory authority following either a tender process or direct negotiations. Exploration licences are valid for up to six years with extensions possible. Production licences are valid for up to 20 years with one five-year extension possible. All contracts signed so far have been PSAs. The petroleum law does not set parameters for the PSA terms as these are determined through negotiations between the parties. IOC-based JVs and PSAs with Turkmenneft have been concentrated typically on offshore oil projects in the Caspian Sea, with a few small onshore fields attracting mid-sized independents. Turkmenistan's energy ministry has said it will not invite foreign oil and gas explorers to invest in its onshore gas fields, Reuters reported in March 2011. External players will only be allowed to carry out exploration and production in the country's sector of the Caspian Sea. They will, however, be able to bid for service contracts for onshore developments. Company 2009 Sales % share of total sales No. of employees Year Overview/State Role Licensing And Regulation Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Government Policy President Berdymukhamedov is taking steps to stimulate investment in the hydrocarbons industry, but it is too early to chart real progress. Officials had hoped to attract US$46bn of cumulative investment in hydrocarbons sector by 2010, but the figure proved a serious overestimation. In 2010, the government believed it would receive US$4bn, up from US$2bn in 2009. The EBRD estimates 2007 FDI at US$753mn. Over the next decade, at least US$5bn a year will need to be invested in Turkmenistan in order for the country to meet its export commitments, according to a report by CMX Caspian Gulf Consultants, cited by Bloomberg in March 2009. CMXs Jennifer Coolige argued: There is an imminent decline in Turkmenistan gas production because of a lack of investments, which has been brought about by the countrys decision not to allow international oil companies in they need Western companies to invest and provide the technology. While Turkmenistans energy sector is being opened up to foreign companies under Berdymukhamedov, the process has been slower than initially expected. Turkmenistans decision to exclude foreign companies from participating in the construction of a major cross-country US2$bn pipeline project will be disappointing to those who hoped the industry would be more attractive under Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov warned in January 2009 that oil and gas production must increase. A subsequent governmental meeting outlined the establishment of a system to deliver energy resources to world markets, execute interstate obligations and develop new fields in the Amudarya Basin and other areas. It remains to be seen whether such obligations will be enough to allow a substantial boost in output. State-run Turkmengaz planned to increase its production capacity to 100bcm by the start of 2010, according to an anonymous government source cited by Reuters in November 2009. The source added that increased output levels would depend on the level of demand for Turkmen gas. The report served as further indication that Turkmenistan would pursue a strategy focused on diversifying its gas exports away from Russia, which has served as the countrys predominant export market. Many of the countrys prime oil deposits are located in disputed areas of the Caspian Sea, and without an agreement between Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan on maritime borders, these fields will likely remain undeveloped. In 2007, Chevron began negotiations with Turkmenistan on the disputed Kyapaz/Serdar oil and gas field linking Turkmen and Azeri maritime borders in the Caspian Sea and, in February 2008, Buried Hill claimed that it had signed a PSA with the Turkmen government to begin production from this field. The field holds an estimated 700mn bbl of reserves, according to some press reports. Turkmenistan is in political discussions with Azerbaijan. Chevron is holding talks with Turkmenistan over its participation in developing the South Yolotan gas field, Douglas Uchikura, the head of Chevron Nebitgaz Turkmenistan said in November 2009. This International Energy Relations Business Monitor International Ltd Page 38 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 was not confirmed by Turkmen officials but in October 2010, government sources said Chervon and French major Total were negotiating their entrance into the Turkmen Caspian Shelf. Gas Exports To Russia Turkmenistan restarted gas exports to Russia on January 9 2010, bringing to an end a nine-month suspension of flows that followed an explosion on the CAC pipeline in April 2009. Gas exports resumed under the terms of a new agreement signed between Moscow and Ashgabat on December 22 2009, which provided for 30bcm of Turkmen gas to be exported to Russia in 2010 and annually to 2028. Volumes have been cut drastically from the 70-80bcm of exports envisioned under the countries' previous gas supply agreement, which was signed in 2003, and from the 50bcm that Turkmenistan exported to Russia in 2008. In April 2010, an unnamed official from Kazakhstani pipeline operator KazTransGas told Reuters that Gazprom had contracted just 10bcm of gas to be transported from Turkmenistan through Kazakhstan. The resumption of the gas trade between Turkmenistan and Russia brought an end to a long-running dispute between the countries over gas volumes and prices. More broadly, it marked the start of a new relationship between the two countries, in which Turkmenistan's dependence on Russia as the buyer of the bulk of its gas exports has been significantly reduced. In the past, Turkmenistan has had to rely on transporting the vast majority of its gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Russia, giving the Kremlin the power to dictate prices to the Turkmen government. Following the cut-off of flows through the CAC pipeline, however, Turkmenistan has aggressively pursued a strategy of gas export diversification, and in 2009 inaugurated two new export pipelines, one to China and another to Iran. The pipelines will allow Turkmenistan to export an eventual 40bcm of gas a year to China, while exports to Iran could rise to 20bcm. The opening of these new routes to market has given Ashgabat more power in its dealings with Russia, particularly with regard to the prices it can charge for gas exports, and this partly explains why it has taken so long for the gas flows to Russia to resume. Gas exports through the CAC pipeline ceased in early April 2009 after an explosion on the route. Turkmenistan accused Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom of cutting gas volumes through the line without warning, causing a catastrophic build-up in pressure that led to the blast. Although Gazprom denied the charge, it later said that it could not be expected to keep importing very high volumes of gas from Turkmenistan when demand from its customers in Europe had plummeted as a result of the global economic crisis and the downturn in industrial consumption. In 2008 Russia paid US$140/mcm for Turkmen gas, much of which it re-exported to Ukraine. It agreed to switch to European market prices from January 1 2009, although it apparently settled on a fixed price of more than US$300/mcm at the end of 2008. As demand from its European customers plunged and its oil-indexed prices fell, Russia's need for Turkmen gas imports evaporated. Following the pipeline explosion, Moscow sought to renegotiate volumes and prices with Ashgabat. These negotiations continued Business Monitor International Ltd Page 39 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 throughout 2009, with no gas flowing from Turkmenistan to Russia during the period, despite the damage to the pipeline having been repaired by May 2009. During the drawn-out negotiation process, Turkmenistan was able to pursue its export diversification goals vigorously, resulting in the launch of the new routes to China and Iran. Having substantially cut its dependence on Russian gas export routes, Turkmenistan was also in a better position to secure a favourable price for its exports. Although no details on the pricing formula have been officially released, Russian news agency RIA Novosti cites unofficial sources as saying that the price of Turkmen gas exports to Russia will be US$240-250/mcm. While the new reported price is less than Gazprom paid Turkmenistan for its gas in late-2008, it is higher than the current oil-indexed Russian prices, reflecting the changing bargaining position between the two countries. Russian gas company Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country, according to News Central Asia. Although the precise route of the pipeline is unclear, it appears to be aimed at connecting the north-western gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export pipeline to Russia which runs via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In January 2011, it was announced that Gazprom would buy around 38bcm of gas from Central Asian nations during 2011. This represented an increase of 2% y-oy from about 38bcm in 2010. It is not clear how much of this was to come from Turkmenistan. Gas Exports To Iran In January 2010, Turkmenistan opened a new gas pipeline to Iran, further diversifying its energy exports away from Russia. The 12bcm Dauletabad-Sarakhs-Khangeran-Tehran pipeline connects the Dauletabad field in the south-eastern Matriy province to Khangeran. An onward link to Tehran was completed by the Iranians in November 2010. The Dauletabad-Tehran pipeline is the second gas link between the two countries. The 200km Korpezhe-Kurt Kui pipeline was opened in 1996 and supplies northern Iran with around 8bcm per annum. In July 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas exports to Iran to 14bcm per annum following the completion of the pipeline from Dauletabad. Given that total transportation capacity between the two countries is now 20bcm, Iran has an option to ramp up supplies by an additional 6bcm in the future. Iran has long been seen as a potential exporter of gas to Europe, or as a transit route for Central Asian gas. The completion of the second Turkmenistan-Iran gas pipeline makes this plan far more feasible. However, the main problems with the project have long been political rather than technological, with the EU currently opposed to Iranian gas imports. This stance appears to be justified by a US diplomatic Business Monitor International Ltd Page 40 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 communiqu released by website Wikileaks. According to the cable, Iran is interested in exporting gas to the EU in the belief that this will increase its political leverage and to help insulate it from sanctions. Turkmenistan and Iran have agreed to develop the Bolutun gas field in Turkmenistan jointly and to export the fields gas output to Iran, according to Iranian news agency Islamic Republic News Agency , cited by Reuters. Under the deal, Iran will import 10bcm of gas. Neither financial details nor the deals timeframe has been released. The news was announced following an official visit by Berdymukhamedov to Tehran in February 2009, during which the two countries are said to have signed a gas cooperation agreement, as well as three letters of agreement on the expansion of economic and political relations. In light of the new agreements, it remains unclear whether the 10bcm will be in addition to the export volumes currently transported and when these volumes would come onstream. Gas Exports To China In December 2009, the presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan inaugurated the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The pipeline, which covers a total of about 7,000km, transports gas from eastern Turkmenistan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China . The inauguration of the pipeline marks the start of operations of the first of two 1,800km pipelines that start at the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and run to China's north-western Xinjiang region. The first pipeline was expected to transport some 13bcm of gas in 2010. But actual gas export volumes were much less, with Upstream Online having reported that China imported just 2bcm of gas from Central Asia in the first eight months of 2010. A second parallel pipeline was expected to become operational in 2010, with peak production of 40bcm across the entire pipeline expected to be reached between 2012 and 2014. The Central Asian Gas Pipeline is the first pipeline to connect Turkmenistan to China, opening a new resource base for the Asian consumer and offering Turkmenistan access to a new market. Further Gas Export Diversification In April 2008, Turkmenistan agreed to supply the EU with 10bcm per annum of gas from 2009, according to a spokesperson for the then-EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. Although it seemed that no formal agreement had been signed between the two sides, Turkmenistans commitment has been hailed as a successful step towards securing Turkmen gas supplies for the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline, which is designed to reduce the EUs dependence on Russian gas exports. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009 that Turkmenistan had continued to express its willingness to supply the pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. No gas supply deal has yet been reached. EU Energy Commissioner Gnther Oettinger announced in January 2011 that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are prepared to sell a minimum of 28bcm of gas to the Southern Corridor, which includes the Nabucco pipeline project. Oettinger said that the Turkmen president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, had offered to sell 10bcm. As a result, Oettinger said that he was optimistic that work could start on the Southern Corridor in 2012-2013, with Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 operations starting within two or three years, in 2014-2016. Uzbekistan and Iraq would also be willing to supply gas to the EU via the Southern Corridor, Oettinger said. In November 2011, Turkmenistan and Pakistan were expected to sign an agreement over the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. An official source said both the countries had already agreed on the gas sale price of US$360/Mcm at the Turkmenistan Afghanistan border, accounting for a deduction of US$29/Mcm to cover transit and transportation costs through Afghanistan. The pipeline is expected to start gas supply by December 2016, but that depends upon Afghanistan providing credible security. Afghanistan will receive 5bcm of gas, out of total planned supply of 33bcm per annum. The US$4bn TAPI scheme would supply 33bcm of gas per year from the Dauletabad field in south-eastern Turkmenistan. The 1,680km pipeline would comprise a 145km Turkmen section, a 735km Afghan section and an 800km Pakistani section to Fazilka on the Pakistan-India border.

In 1995, Burren formed a partnership with Monument Oil & Gas to acquire upstream acreage in Turkmenistan. In 1996, the companies signed a PSA for the Nebit Dag area. US producer Mobil joined the consortium later that year and Monument was named operator. However, following the takeover of Monument by Lasmo in 1999 and the merger between Mobil and Exxon in the same year, the consortium partners sold their interests in the Nebit Dag PSA to Burren. Enis takeover of Burren, which owned assets in Turkmenistan and in the Republic of Congo, illustrates just how attractive Turkmenistans energy sector has become for IOCs since the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by current President Berdymukhamedov. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Early entry into market One of the only foreign companies present Huge exploration upside potential Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Opportunities: Opportunity to supply future export pipelines Large areas of unexplored territory Opportunity to move into countrys gas sector Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address Saipem Saipem Parahat 11951 Street 1 Asgabat, Turkmenistan www.eni.com Financial Statistics Net sales: EUR98bn EUR83bn EUR108bn EUR87bn EUR86bn EUR73bn Net profit: EUR6bn EUR4bn EUR8bn EUR10bn EUR9bn EUR8bn Operating Statistics Oil production 12,000b/d 12,000b/d 12,000b/d 22,000b/d 21,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 43 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Market Position In 2007, Eni made a recommended offer to acquire the entire share capital of Burren. In January 2008, Eni secured 77% of Burren for an agreed GBP1bn. The acquisition gives Eni control over Turkmenistans Nebit Dag PSA area, which has been producing oil since the 1940s. Nebit Dag covers an area of 1,050sq km onshore western Turkmenistan. The area consists of five developed oil and gas fields. Burren is the sole owner and operator of the areas largest field the Burun field since 2000. The field came onstream in the 1970s but was still being developed at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union. Burren also holds a share in the other four fields Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, Dara Tepe and Nebit Dag which are operated by state-owned Turkmenneft. The PSA runs until 2022, after which it may be extended for an additional 10 years. In its latest annual report Eni reported total liquids output of 12,000b/d in 2010, suggesting its existing producing assets have reached a plateau. Strategy As President Berdymukhamedov proceeds with reforming the countrys energy sector and opening the country up to increased foreign investment, Eni is likely to be looking to increase its position in the country. It is hoped that Turkmenistan will become a significant source of new gas supply for the EU through the planned Nabucco pipeline. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 44 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Dragon Oil Company Analysis Dubai-based Dragon Oil is one of the few foreign oil companies pursuing a steady drilling effort in Turkmenistan. The company signed a PSA in 2000, prior to the introduction of a more open foreign investment regime initiated by President Berdymukhamedov, which has given Dragon Oil a head start in a prime investment destination. It is likely that Dragon Oil will be keen to increase its acreage in the country, should the president proceed with awarding further licences. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Substantial domestic oil producer Strong relationship with government Early entrance into and established position in market Weaknesses: Artificially low domestic and export gas prices Lack of developed infrastructure Opportunities: Rise in regional oil and gas consumption Long-term export opportunities Threats: Underdeveloped legal system Changes in national energy policy Address Dragon Oil Plc, ENOC House IIThird Floor Right Wing Sheikh Rashid Road Dubai, UAE Tel: +971 4 305 3660 Fax: +971 4 335 6954 www.dragonoil.com Financial Statistics Revenues: US$780mn US$623mn US$706mn US$597mn US$325mn Net profit: US$386mn US$259mn US$369mn US$304mn US$187mn Operating Statistics Oil production: 47,211b/d 44,765b/d 40,992b/d 32,000b/d 20,000b/d Business Monitor International Ltd Page 45 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Market Position The Emirates National Oil Company , itself owned by the government of Dubai, holds a 52% share in London- and Dublin-listed Dragon Oil. The company signed a 25-year PSA for the Cheleken Contract Area in 2000. Dragon Oil is the operator and holds sole ownership over the acreage. Under the agreement, the company also has exclusive rights to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years once the contract expires in 2025. The Cheleken Contract Area is located in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea and covers an area of around 950sq km, which comprises two offshore oil and gas fields Dzheitune and Dzhygalybeg in water depths of 8m-42m. The fields were discovered in the Soviet era. Cheleken holds estimated proven and probable reserves of 651mn bbl of oil and condensate and 99bcm of gas. As of early-2007, the company had invested US$618mn in the project. Chelekens output was 20,000b/d in 2006, rising to a record 44,765b/d in 2009. Recruitment Dragon Oil expects its oil production to reach 100,000b/d by 2015, according to CEO Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa. This represents an annual increase of 10-15% over the next four years. The company aims to maintain this production rate for at least five years, according to Khalifa. Dragon forecast production of 70,000b/d of oil by end-2011. Strategy Between 2010 and 2012 Dragon Oil is planning capital expenditure for oil infrastructure projects of US$600-700mn, US$100mn less than in the 2009-2011 period. As of 2010 the company claimed cumulative investment of US$1bn in the country. In late 2010 it announced plans to boost output to 75,000b/d, without specifying the projects involved. Dragon plans to complete a total of 40 development wells, including five appraisal wells. Dragon hopes that this expenditure will boost annual production growth by 10-15% in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the company plans to install two additional wellhead and production platforms by 2013 at the latest. The company is also looking to expand its upstream asset base by bidding for new blocks and actively pursuing farm-in agreements. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 Petronas Summary Petronas Chiragli signed a 25-year PSA with the government in 1996. Under the contract, the company has been awarded exploration and development rights to contract area Block 1, which includes the offshore fields Magtymguly, Ovez and Diyarbekir. In 2006, the Malaysian company began producing 10,000b/d from the Diyarbekir field. Petronas has started up an onshore gas terminal and gas processing plant on Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast, in order to allow production to begin from its offshore Block-1 assets. The block has long been seen as a potential source of gas for export to Europe via the much-mooted Southern Corridor, but the absence of infrastructure makes this unlikely in the short term. Although gas from the block will initially be sent to Russia, over the long term exports to Europe are still possible. The gas processing plant and onshore terminal, located at Kiyanly near the Caspian Sea port of Trkmenbay, were launched on July 12 2011, according to a report by Malaysian national news agency Bernama. The processing plant comprises two process trains with a combined capacity of up to 10bcm per annum. The plant is linked to a 53km gas pipeline which flows into the Central Asia-Centre 3 export pipeline. The facilities involved an investment of US$5bn, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told Bernama. CNPC was awarded a licence to develop the onshore Bagtyyarlyk gas field on August 29 2007. The field, which is located in the western part of the country, holds estimated reserves of 1tcm. CNPC is the first foreign company to gain development rights to an onshore gas field in Turkmenistan. Under the PSA, CNPC has been awarded the development rights to the field and gas from the field will then be exported to China via the Central Asian Gas Pipeline. The Bagtyyarlyk field will supply 17bcm for the pipeline. Construction of the 7,000km pipeline, which will transport 30bcm of gas annually to China over the next 30 years was inaugurated in December 2009. The pipelines capacity will be increased to 40bcm at a later stage. The pipeline starts in eastern Turkmenistan and traverses Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to China. 4,500km of the pipeline is in Chinese territory. CNPC reported what appears to be a major gas discovery in September 2010. CNPC said exploration well Oja-21 in Block B maintained a flow of 1Mcm/d of gas and 36cubic metres per day of condensate during testing. The company has estimated that the discovery, part of the Amu Darya Natural Gas Project, could hold more than 100bn bcm of reserves. PetroChina said in early September 2009 that it would pay US$1bn to its parent company CNPC for its share of the Amu Darya Right Bank gas field in Turkmenistan. The field, which was scheduled to come onstream by the end of 2009, has been earmarked to supply the second West-East gas pipeline that will transport gas to Shanghai. China National Petroleum Corporation Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 47 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 In December 2009, CNPC and Petrofac won contracts to develop the South Yolotan gas field, alongside two South Korean companies LG International Corporation and Hyundai Engineering Company. These agreements totalled US$9bn and included both drilling and plant development. Gazprom announced that it reached two energy agreements with Turkmenistan during a meeting between Gazproms chairman, Alexei Miller, and Berdymukhamedov on July 25 2008. The two sides have reportedly agreed on the price formation principles that will be used for Russian gas purchases over the next 20 years. The second agreement relates to Gazproms participation in Turkmenistans gas sector, including the financing and construction of gas pipeline facilities as well as its participation in the development of gas fields. The agreements will allow Gazprom to maintain its stronghold over Turkmenistans large gas reserves and export pipelines. In April 2003, the Russian and Turkmen presidents signed a bilateral cooperation agreement covering natural gas, which will remain in force from January 1 2004 until December 31 2028. Within the deal, Turkmenneftegaz agreed a contract for the supply of Turkmen natural gas over the same period. Independent Russian gas producer Itera has said that it will invest as much as US$6bn by 2020 in developing Block 21 offshore Turkmenistan, a company executive told Reuters in April 2010. Gennady Skidanov, an Itera executive, told Reuters that the company was planning to invest US$5-6bn from 2010 through to 2020 in its offshore Block 21 and that the initial exploration phase would cost US$300mn. The company signed a PSA to develop the block, which is located in the Turkmen section of the Caspian Sea, on September 13 2009. Itera will build a pipeline in Turkmenistan to connect the countrys gas fields in the Karakum desert to the main export route to Russia, according to a Turkmen official cited by Reuters. State company Turkmengaz will finance the project, which will cost US$177mn. The February 2009 announcement followed 2007 talks between President Berdymukhamedov and head of the Itera group of companies, Igor Makarov, during which Itera said that it would build a US$600mn carbamide plant in the country according to News Central Asia. Itera signed a deal with Turkmenistan on September 13 2009 to jointly develop an offshore field in Block 21. Reserves at the field are estimated at 1bn bbl of oil and 60bcm of gas. The signing of the PSA was overseen by the presidents of both Turkmenistan and Russia. The deal may signal the start of improved relations between the two countries, which had been tense since April 2009 following an explosion on Turkmenistans main gas export pipeline to Russia. The Itera deal shows that Turkmenistan is still willing to undertake projects with Russian firms, despite disputes with Gazprom. Gazprom Summary Itera Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 48 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 By signing the deal, Itera beat off competition from Russian independent Lukoil and its former partner, US major ConocoPhillips, which held talks with the Turkmen government about offshore blocks including Block 21 in 2008. Although Itera has been operating in Turkmenistan for two decades and is led by the Turkmen-born businessman, Igor Makarov, this was the first time the company had been awarded an offshore concession in the country. Preliminary estimates suggest that the field in Block 21 could produce about 10bcm of gas a year and an average of 385,000b/d of oil. RWE Dea has announced that it signed a PSA on July 15 2009 to explore and develop Block 23 in Turkmenistans section of the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan and RWE signed a preliminary deal for the block in April 2009 when RWEs CEO Jrgen Gromann and Turkmenistans President Berdymukhamedov met in the Central Asian country. The signing is a triumph for RWE, which had been trying to secure a deal in the country for some time. Block 23, covering around 940sq km, is located in the south-eastern region of the Caspian Sea, in the shallow waters off Turkmenistans coast. Under the agreement, in the first exploration phase RWE will undertake an environmental study. The company will also carry out a 3-seismic test over a 400sq km area, with some 2D-seismic data already available. Once it has completed the seismic survey, RWE plans to drill one exploration well, as its agreement with Turkmenistan requires it to do. In April 2010 the company said it would invest US$60-80mn in the block between 2010 and 2014. RWEs CEO, Jrgen Gromann, and the Turkmen president are also said to have discussed alternative routes to transport Turkmen gas to Europe during Gromanns visit to Turkmenistan on April 16 2009. Stefan Judisch, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading, told Reuters in early December 2009, that Turkmenistan had continued to express its willingness to supply the Nabucco pipeline and that his company was looking to agree gas supply terms with Turkmengaz in H110. The deal is yet to materialise. A consortium led by Denmark's Maersk Oil returned a Caspian Sea block to the Turkmen government after failing to encounter sufficiently attractive prospects during the initial exploration phase. The JV decided not to proceed with the next exploration phase for Block 11-12, a spokesperson for the German consortium member Wintershall confirmed to Upstream in January 2010. Maersk operated the block with a 30% stake from 2002, working alongside Wintershall and ONGC Mittal Energy , a JV between India's national oil company and steelmaking giant. The permit covered 5,700sq km off the port of Turkmenbashi. Serbia's oil monopoly Naftna Industrija Srbije has won an upstream deal in Turkmenistan valued at US$33mn, the company said in a January 12 2011 statement quoted by Reuters. NIS will drill two 4,800m wells in the Akpatlauk oil field, two 3,800m wells in the Ekerem oil field and one 4,500m well in RWE Summary Others Summary Business Monitor International Ltd Page 49 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 the Keimir oil field, all of which are being developed by state-run Turkmenneft. The project was expected to start in June 2011 and be completed by February 2012. Service Companies Petrofac Among the Western firms, Petrofac has gained a major first mover advantage in Turkmenistan, winning a deal to develop the giant South Yolotan field on behalf of state-run Turkmengaz in 2009. In mid-2010, construction began on a new US$2bn pipeline, with 30bcm of capacity, connecting South Yolotan-Osman to Turkmenistan's Caspian Sea coast. Petrofac completed work on South Yolotan's first phase in December 2009, working as a contractor for state-run Turkmengaz. That contract was worth US$100mn. In the same month, Petrofac won a contract to undertake a FEED study and initial planning for the second phase infrastructure. South Yolotan represents Petrofac's sole ongoing Turkmen operation. Petrofac said on December 22 2010 that it had commenced work on the project's US$3bn second phase, which is expected to be completed in mid-2013. The second phase will require the provision of EPC work for a 10bcm per annum gas processing plant, as well as infrastructure and pipeline for the entire South Yolotan field, which will have a gas export capacity of 20bcm per year.

A significant element of risk is clearly associated with these forecasts, as project timing is critical to volume delivery. Our assumptions also take into account some third-party estimates, such as those provided by the US-based Energy Information Administration , the International Energy Agency , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain consultants reports that are in the public domain. Reserves projections reflect production and depletion trends, expected exploration activity and historic reserves replacement levels. We have assumed flat oil and gas prices throughout the extended forecast period, but continue to provide sensitivity analysis based on higher and lower price scenarios. Investment levels and production/reserves trends will of course be influenced by energy prices. Oil demand has provide itself to be less sensitive to pricing than expected, but will still have some bearing on consumption trends. Otherwise, we have assumed a slowing of GDP growth for all countries beyond our core forecast period and a further easing of demand trends to reflect energy-saving efforts and fuels substitution away from hydrocarbons. Where available, government and third-party projections of oil and gas demand have been used to cross check our own assumptions.

First, we have disaggregated the upstream and downstream , enabling us to take a more nuanced approach to analysing the potential within each segment, and identifying the different risks along the value chain. Second, we have identified objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues and trends that were previously evaluated on a subjective basis. Finally, we have used BMIs proprietary Country Risk Ratings in a more refined manner in order to ensure that only those risks most relevant to the industry have been included. Overall, the new ratings system which is now integrated with those of all industries covered by BMI offers an industry-leading insight into the prospects/risks for companies across the globe. Conceptually, the new ratings system is organised in a manner that enables us clearly to present the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each state. As before, the headline oil and gas rating is the principal rating. However, the differentiation of upstream and downstream and the articulation of the elements that comprise each segment enable more sophisticated conclusions to be drawn, and also facilitate the use of the ratings by clients who have varying levels of exposure and risk appetite. Oil & Gas Risk/Reward Rating: This is the overall rating, which comprises 50% upstream and 50% downstream; Upstream Oil & Gas Risk/Reward Rating: This is the overall upstream rating, which is composed of rewards/risks ; Downstream Oil & Gas Risk/Reward Rating: This is the overall downstream rating, which comprises rewards/risks ; Both the upstream and downstream are composed of Risks/Rewards sub-ratings, which themselves comprise industry-specific and broader country risk components; Rewards: Evaluates the sectors size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry and state characteristics that may inhibit its development; Risks: Evaluates both industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the states political and economic profile that call into question the likelihood of expected returns being realised over the assessed time period.

Source: BMI Business Monitor International Ltd Page 62 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 BMI Methodology How We Generate Our Industry Forecasts BMIs industry forecasts are generated using the best-practice techniques of time-series modelling. The precise form of time-series model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case being determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. For example, data for some industries may be particularly prone to seasonality, meaning seasonal trends. In other industries, there may be pronounced non-linearity, whereby large recessions, for example, may occur more frequently than cyclical booms. Our approach varies from industry to industry. Common to our analysis of every industry, however, is the use of vector autoregressions. Vector autoregressions allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variables own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variables own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historical data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. It must be remembered that human intervention plays a necessary and desirable part of all our industry forecasting techniques. Intimate knowledge of the data and industry ensures we spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. There are a number of principal criteria that drive our forecasts for each Energy indicator. Energy supply Supply of crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products and electrical power is determined largely by investment levels, available capacity, plant utilisation rates and national policy. We therefore examine: National energy policy, stated output goals and investment levels; Company-specific capacity data, output targets and capital expenditures, using national, regional and multinational company sources; Energy Industry Business Monitor International Ltd Page 63 Turkmenistan Oil & Gas Report Q1 2012 International quotas, guidelines and projections such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA. Energy consumption A mixture of methods are used to generate demand forecasts, applied as appropriate to each individual country: Underlying economic growth for individual countries/regions, sourced from BMI published estimates. Historic relationships between GDP growth and energy demand growth at an individual country are analysed and used as the basis for predicting levels of consumption; Government projections for oil, gas and electricity demand; Third-party agency projections for regional demand, such as IEA, EIA, OPEC; Extrapolation of capacity expansion forecasts based on company- or state-specific investment levels. Whenever possible, we compare government and/or third party agency projections with the declared spending and capacity expansion plans of the companies operating in each individual country. Where there are discrepancies, we use company-specific data as physical spending patterns to ultimately determine capacity and supply capability. Similarly, we compare capacity expansion plans and demand projections to check the energy balance of each country. Where the data suggest imports or exports, we check that necessary capacity exists or that the required investment in infrastructure is taking place. Sources include those international bodies mentioned above such as OPEC, IEA, and EIA, as well as local energy ministries, official company information, and international and national news, and international and national news agencies.

3b8aa0bb-985d-4c31-b7bc-a82ccb589da5,"The U.S. and its European allies scored a diplomatic victory in convincing Russia and China to help it to step up pressure on Iran by empowering a nuclear watchdog to order snap inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities. In a draft resolution presented Wednesday, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the U.S., Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom -- plus Germany called it ""essential and urgent"" that Iran give international inspectors unfettered access to its nuclear sites. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors is expected to approve the resolution at its meeting in Vienna this week, diplomats said. Legally, the language of the resolution, particularly the use of the words ""essential and urgent,"" would give the U.N. agency some more leverage in its long-standing and often-stalled probe of Iran's nuclear program, which the U.S. suspects is intended to develop weapons, a charge Tehran denies. The move came as a bipartisan group of ambassadors, retired generals and foreign policy experts warn against a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities without a more thorough public discussion to weigh the costs and benefits. In a paper and letter to be released Thursday, the group argues that an attack could delay Iran's development of a nuclear weapon for up to four years, but would have other consequences, such as rallying the Iranian people behind its regime. ""We think the national debate of the issue should be well informed,"" said Thomas Pickering, a former U.N. envoy who helped to organize the group. ""People should understand it is not a slam dunk, these are very hard issues."" The atomic agency, meanwhile, doesn't have power to enforce resolutions, but not obeying a snap-inspection order would put Iran in violation of the U.N. nuclear safeguards treaty it signed on to in 1974 and could further isolate it diplomatically. The strongly worded resolution indicated a new sense of urgency to pressure Iran, particularly as Syria's civil war and growing calls within Israel's government to attack Iran stir tensions in the Middle East. During the drafting process, the U.S. and its European allies urged Russia and China to agree to the resolution's wording. Russia, which has close ties with Iran, initially had called for less-specific language, diplomats from both countries said. Barnes contributed to this article.

e0f6861a-9f9f-4bd7-9c46-31209458ddd8,"BEIJING -- China called on Russia to explain what it called an ""alleged attack"" on Chinese fishing vessels this week, as well as the fate of a sailor missing off Russia's east coast, in the latest bout of tension between Moscow and Beijing. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Cheng Guoping expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with Russia Thursday over the incident, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The report said that Russian forces opened fire on the Chinese boat and that one sailor was missing. ""China demands Russia thoroughly investigate the incident and inform China of the results in a timely manner,"" Mr. Cheng said, according to Xinhua, which added that he summoned an unidentified Russian diplomat to hear the demand. Chinese officials haven't responded to requests to comment, and attempts to contact the Chinese consulate in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok were unsuccessful. Chinese state-run media said this week that two Chinese fishing vessels were seized by Russia, one on Sunday and one on Monday, citing the Chinese consulate in Vladivostok. One ship carried 19 fishermen and the other 17, according to the reports. According to Russia's Border Guard Service, the vessel captured on Monday was inside the country's exclusive economic zone, tried to ram a Russian vessel, and then resisted when Russian personnel tried to board. The ship was fishing for squid, according to both sides, with the Russian reports saying its hold was filled with an unauthorized squid haul. In a similar episode in 2009, China said that a Russian warship fired on a Chinese cargo vessel, and that seven crew members were missing. Russian authorities had said the boat didn't stop despite warning shots. Though they are traditional rivals, China and Russia are in accord on a number of major global issues, including opposition to efforts at the United Nations Security Council to enact tougher measures against Syria and Iran. But they have struggled to reach agreements on natural-gas exports and are among the players jockeying for power in the resource-rich Central Asia region. Mr. Cheng said Russia should make sure that the detained sailors are safe, that their legitimate rights are guaranteed and that they are provided with humanitarian treatment, according to Xinhua.

ab16eb87-9d75-4a14-bcca-a3e31336b684,"News Stories and Documents AuthorAffiliation Richard Solash By Richard Solash March 11, 2013 WASHINGTON -- The battle over the Sergei Magnitsky case is moving to Europe. After being lobbied by activists for nearly three years, the U.S. Congress passed legislation in late 2012 to sanction Russian officials implicated in the prosecution and death of Magnitsky, a whistle-blowing Moscow lawyer who died in pretrial detention. The case has come to symbolize Russia's perceived rights failings. The U.S. law, which provides for asset freezes and visa bans on Russian officials who violate human rights, was never meant to be an end in itself. Instead, the legislation was a stepping stone to passing something similar in the European Union. And that effort is now gaining momentum. THE MAGNITSKY MONEY: From Russia...And Then What? ""Russians consider themselves, really, like a part of Europe -- Europeans,"" says Kristiina Ojuland, a member of the European Parliament from Estonia who has spearheaded the push. ""And therefore it's significant that Europe reacts, not only the Magnitsky case, but in broader terms, reacts against this corrupt, black money that is flying into the EU countries."" Asset freezes and visa bans in Europe would hit Russian officials considerably harder than similar sanctions in the United States. As Ojuland notes, Russian officials are fond of vacationing, shopping, and educating their children in EU countries. They are also more likely to keep money in European banks. Moral Stand Magnitsky was jailed in 2008 after implicating officials from Russian government ministries in a complex scheme to steal $230 million from state coffers. He was repeatedly denied medical care and beaten before his death in 2009. Several top officials implicated by Magnitsky have since received promotions. Russia has accused Magnitsky of tax evasion and is trying him posthumously. That trial was due to begin on March 11 but was quickly adjourned until March 22 to give the court-appointed defense team additional time to prepare. Ojuland's 2012 proposal recommended an EU-wide visa-restriction regime and asset-freezes to target implicated Russian officials. It was overwhelmingly approved by the European Parliament in a nonbinding resolution, but for EU-wide sanctions to come into effect, all 27 member states would need to agree to them. The bloc's foreign ministers have not taken up the issue. Neither has foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Lawmakers have continued to push, arguing that Europe is obligated to take a moral stand on Russia's rights and rule-of-law transgressions. Moscow's Leverage Supporters of sanctions also point to investigations into the money trail that Magnitsky uncovered. Millions of dollars allegedly stolen from the Russian treasury sit in bank accounts in the Baltics, Switzerland, Moldova, and elsewhere in Europe. In February, Russia's outgoing Central Bank Chairman Sergei Ignatiev said $49 billion exited the country in 2012 through ""questionable transactions."" But passing sanctions in Europe will also run into stiff opposition. The EU relies on Moscow for one-third of its gas and imported 198 billion euros' worth of goods from Russia in 2011, a record year for bilateral trade. There are fears that Russia could use this leverage to retaliate against European sanctions. After the U.S. legislation was passed, Moscow responded with a law banning Americans from adopting Russian children. RUSSIAN ADOPTION BAN: One U.S. Family Counts Its Blessings While Others Fight On Prior to last year's resolution, the European Parliament passed another back in 2010 that also called for sanctions in response to the Magnitsky case, but it went nowhere. Pressing Europe An EU official in Brussels with knowledge of the situation told RFE/RL that Ashton is not ignoring the parliament's actions and that Magnitsky sanctions are still ""on the table."" The official said, however, they are only considered a last resort. William Browder, CEO of the investment firm Hermitage Capital where Magnitsky worked in Moscow, says he is on a mission to make them a priority. ""After the passage of the Magnitsky Act in America, our single biggest priority became the passage of the same act in Europe,"" Browder says. ""The American action was extremely significant because it set the precedent, but the European action will be even more material to the Russians because they keep orders of magnitude more property and money in Europe."" The U.S.-born Browder has led an international campaign to seek justice for his former lawyer. He was instrumental in lobbying for the U.S. Magnitsky law and now says EU-wide sanctions are in sight, despite reservations at the top. ""What can happen and what will happen is that we're going to drum up such public support that the executive is going to start to worry about this becoming a political issue which they might lose their own support if they take an immoral view,"" Browder says. Browder launched his European campaign in February, meeting with foreign ministry officials and parliamentarians in Berlin and Paris. On February 27, he testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Irish Parliament. 'Spy' Charge Ireland is of particular interest in the businessman's campaign, as the country currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, allowing it to shape the agenda of the European Council of foreign ministers. Browder has done contingency planning as well. His country-by-country push could help convince at least one of the 26 states in Europe's Schengen Area to enact its own visa bans. The bans would then automatically apply to all other nations in the zone. As Browder plans more European travel, Russia has charged him with illegally purchasing $100 million in shares of the state-controlled Gazprom company. The pro-Kremlin television channel NTV recently aired a documentary claiming that Browder was a spy for Britain and had exploited Magnitsky's death for his own gain. The businessman says the Russian moves are part of a ""desperate"" effort to deter his campaign for sanctions. Meanwhile, European lawmakers and leaders will also be keeping a watchful eye on Washington next month -- and the reaction from Moscow that is sure to follow. The first round of names of sanctioned Russian officials is due to be published in the U.S. federal register by April 13. Ojuland says that will be a ""signal"" and ""encouragement"" to European governments. RFE/RL Correspondent Rikard Jozwiak contributed to this report from Brussels Copyright 2011.

2818c513-dd96-4254-938c-a58c33f7dabf,"Text of report by the website of pro-government Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda on 4 April Is a new Cold War possible? Who benefits from the conflict between Russia and the West, and what advantages can be extracted from it? We talked about this with political expert Fedor Lukyanov, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy. Fedor Aleksandrovich, events in Ukraine have led to a situation where Russia, perhaps for the first time in recent decades, has demonstrated to the West that it is not a tame country. Have we grown stronger or was it simply the way circumstances developed? Russia was never a tame country, even during the periods of the lowest points in its potential. In the early and mid-1990s, because of the collapse, the internal crisis, and the high dependence on financial aid from leading countries, Russia was forced to follow in the wake of America and Europe. But even then it tried to adjust the line that they were imposing on it. Russia always had a dissenting opinion - on Yugoslavia, on Iraq, and on other issues. And when, after 2003-2004, we were freed from acute financial dependence, the level of control of Russia's line from outside was first reduced and then effectively disappeared. But prior to the events connected with Crimea, even when our relations with the West deteriorated most sharply , there was still scope for compromise. After all, from Gorbachev's time until recently it was thought that relations with the West are valuable in themselves and that a common language must be found in any situation. But in the Ukrainian and Crimean clash Russia decided not to hold back, no matter what the cost in relations with the United States and Europe. I think this change marks not exactly a different Russia. It is still the same as it was. But now the country's leadership is proceeding on the basis that good relations with the West are necessary but not at all costs. Did this happen solely because such a crucial morsel as Crimea was at issue? Of course in the case of Ukraine and Crimea, psychologically, geopolitically, and historically, a particular nerve is touched. This is Russia's fundamental idea of its own security and its place in Europe. There is no room for concessions here. On the other hand, a feeling has long been developing in the Russian leadership that the West does not take it as an equal. No matter what you do, whether you make concessions, whether you put forward proposals - all the same, there is an invisible wall. And it seems to me that ultimately Vladimir Putin came to the same conclusion as many Russian leaders in history, who began with the desire to make some kind of qualitative change in relations with the West, but then, after trying once, again, and a third time, became convinced that you cannot change them qualitatively, you must return to the position that Russia is respected and valued only when it pursues a really autonomous policy. That does not mean an aggressive policy. It means that it is not determined by anyone else. Putin is frequently berated for never having tried to smooth relations with the West. Suffice it to recall his deliberately unfiltered speeches at many summits. Putin tried more than anyone. But he is very different from the statistical average world politician of today. Putin is not a clone and is much more open in his remarks than Western leaders. And in this sense this characteristic style has always created the sense of some kind of threat emanating from Russia. But that is the form. If you look at the content, in his first term as president, Putin was so committed to partnership with the West that he went even further than Yeltsin. It was Putin who closed the Russian military facilities in Cuba and Vietnam. It was Putin who offered the United States help in combating terrorism, Al-Qa'idah, the Taleban, who gave the de facto green light to the siting of American bases in Central Asia. Who repeatedly offered the Europeans major deals, such as technology in exchange for energy sources. But it always ran aground on something. The message from Russia to close the chapter of the Cold War and start anew was not accepted. What happened after that, when unfiltered speeches began to be heard from the president's lips in relation to the West increasingly frequently, was the reaction of disappointment to all these failures. And if Putin began from the premise that the Cold War must finally be buried and the chapter closed, now, it seems to me, he has come to the conclusion that the Cold War must be replayed. Not in the sense of all of it, but the final stage, from the results of which it transpired that the Soviet Union is apparently the vanquished side while the West is the winning side, and therefore we must do what they consider right and necessary. But the Cold War in the sense in which it existed in the second half of the 20th century will not happen again. Back then, the confrontation between the USSR and the United States was the crux of world politics, everything else was superimposed on it. Now, no matter what kind of relations we have with America and Europe, this is only a part of world politics, and not the most important part. Hence the impossibility of the kind of isolation of Russia that President Obama is talking about. Nobody is able to organize complete isolation, that is, to involve Asia, the Arab world, Iran, and Latin America, because everyone now makes up their own mind. Let Us Go East How dangerous are Western sanctions to us? The promised sanctions represent a stereotype that was used in Yugoslavia, Myanmar, Libya, Iraq, and Iran. I think their inapplicability to a country on the scale of Russia will become clear quite soon. The reciprocal damage is so great that it is not worth it. But the problem is that Russia has not become a full part of the global economy in order to extract the maximum benefit from this, like China, for instance. And now the West will probably try quietly to push us out of the markets. This could have both pluses and minuses. The level of consumption could fall and it will be necessary to return to a more modest existence. But the pluses lie in the fact that a review of the economic model is long overdue in Russia. This means an incentive really to begin diversification and to escape hydrocarbon dependence. It means the need to turn towards the East, towards Asia, because it is becoming most important in the world - in both economic and political terms. To attract more money, technologies, and specialists from there. What should happen in our relations with China now, for instance, happened in the mid-1960s in the USSR when the decision was adopted to build a gas pipeline to Western Europe and Siberian gas began to be exploited. As a result Brezhnev determined our situation and geopolitics of today. Without those gas pipelines we would have developed a different relationship with Europe, much worse, I think. But now this is doing much to stabilize everything. China has long been laying claim to the title of world leader, are there not dangers in an excessive rapprochement with it? Of course China is watching everything that is happening not without satisfaction. A Russia that has no choice and is forced to reorient itself is much more convenient to China than a Russia that can choose for itself whom to cooperate with. So it is extremely important that we should not see China as synonymous with Asia. And the fact that Russia, in parallel with rapprochement with China, has made very serious efforts to normalize relations with Japan, has collaborated increasingly with South Korea, and has renewed its links with Vietnam indicates that the Kremlin understands this. Everything will become slightly more complicated now, because the United States will put pressure on its allies, first and foremost Japan and South Korea, to try to steer them in the common anti-Russian line. I do not think this will succeed fully. The Japanese have such an interest in not allowing Russia to lock onto China that they could even try to resist Washington's pressure. Europe Under the Thumb Again Russia was thrown out of the G8 format. That was an interesting experiment that continued for more than 15 years. Boris Yeltsin made great efforts to get Russia in. We joined the club of prosperous, industrially developed states in 1998, literally on the eve of the default. Subsequently there were attempts to turn the G8 into a real organ of not Western but world governance. But after 2008 the ""non-Western world"" broke through into a new format - the G20. The G8 is a spent force. Crimea was the formal reason for its disintegration. I do not know what the G7 will do now. There will doubtless be an attempt at consolidation, at the revival of the West of Cold War times, which subsequently unravelled completely on the basis of interests. Will Europe not find itself entirely under the US thumb now? After all, the EU leadership made a mess of the operation in Ukraine. In the famous telephone leak, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland assessed the EU's diplomatic capabilities in unprintable terms. In fact she is right. Because the crisis in Ukraine is not a carefully planned special operation but the result of a total failure by the EU to understand whom they are dealing with. Not a trace remains of the euphoria of the late 20th and early 21st century, when it appeared that Europe was becoming united, strong, and extremely influential in the world and would speak on equal terms with America, Russia, and China. The weight of the united Europe in the world is less than the weight of individual European countries was 20 years ago. In effect the EU has recognized that it is forced to go back under US patronage. But then Europe will have to do something for itself all the same, because it is not a priority for the United States, either. Asia and the Chinese salient will be most important. Ukraine created the illusion that big world politics have come back here. I will venture to suggest that six months will collapse and it will become clear that in actual fact no events in Ukraine can affect the foundations of world affairs. Everything will return to the Middle and Far East. And everyone will forget about Ukraine? If the presidential election in Ukraine results in collapse and chaos, then it will be necessary to deal with this, although I do not think anyone particularly wants to. Otherwise the situation will turn into a slow-moving, chronic problem and interest will decline. Remember Georgia, which at one time was the West's favourite child. So much attention was paid to it, but then a great many more urgent problems arose. Ukraine is on a larger scale, of course, but it too is hardly likely to remain at the centre of events for long. That is the way the modern world is - the general consciousness cannot hold a single topic in its head for long. Who is interested in the war in Syria now? It is still going on, nothing has changed there, but everyone has switched to something else. Nobody Wants the Partition of Ukraine People in the West are afraid that Russia will start annexing the eastern oblasts of Ukraine. In political terms this would of course be a very serious shock. In this case the West's opposition would be many times higher than we are seeing now. But I consider this scenario unlikely. I do not think Russia will start partitioning Ukraine. Crimea's belonging to Ukraine was a historical accident and an injustice. The same cannot be said for the remaining territories of Ukraine, where the population's attitude will not be so unequivocal. The only scenario in which I do not rule out further actions by Russia is if Ukraine starts disintegrating spontaneously because of a flareup of struggle within the victorious group. Conflicts are already beginning there. And that is absolutely natural. Any revolution of this kind begins quite quickly to sort the participants into categories, and those categories fight one another. If an attempt is made to extend the nationalist ideology to the eastern lands of Ukraine's territory, which would undoubtedly provoke resistance, and if Kyiv stops suppressing the protests, then it would be difficult for the Russian leadership to ignore this. But that is the most extreme scenario. The revolutions that have swept through many countries in recent years have shown that it is very easy to take the conflict to extremes. Does the West want that, in the case of Ukraine? The West was not particularly prepared even for this phase. Nobody was expecting everything to happen so quickly and so radically. It seems to me that many people both in our country and in the West simply underestimated the extent to which the structure of the state of Ukraine was fragile and unstable. People in the West thought this was a second version of the Orange Revolution, that it would only be necessary to give a little help to the people who had risen up against the corrupt tyrant, and everything would be fine. But in Russia, based on the lessons of that same Orange Revolution, at a certain stage what they thought was this: We must show toughness and, from the outset, put an end to all demonstrations, and then everything will be fine. We were wrong, and so were they. It turned out that Ukraine had already reached a condition such that toughness would not work, but notions of a peaceful Orange revolution were not justified either. The structure of the Ukrainian political system simply crumbled. Now, it seems to me, the West is very concerned to prevent the total collapse of the Ukrainian project. And in the event of further inflammation, that is becoming very likely. On the contrary, they would most likely wish to stabilize the situation, to enable Ukraine to get back on its feet a little, and then start gradually affiliating it to the Western sphere. Yanukovych, with his absolutely senseless and incompetent actions, prepared the ground for the crisis. But the seeds were sown long ago, in an entirely different situation. In the early 2000s Western structures were working seriously in Ukraine and George Bush had a deliberate policy of dragging Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. It did not work out. First the Orange revolutionaries well and truly failed, then Georgia provoked Russia and suffered defeat in 2008. Barack Obama never displayed the same level of interest in the post-Soviet space as his predecessor. But now Bush's seeds have come up. After all, the right sectors did not spring up overnight, they developed step by step, partly autonomously, and partly somebody was encouraging them - both foreigners and their own oligarchs. And this exploded when nobody particularly needed it. Obama was completely occupied with other matters. In the first phase of the Ukrainian crisis it was evident that he did not want to get involved at all. But then he had to, because, as the saying goes, if you don't do foreign policy, it will do for you. They Will Bomb Less Frequently Can we forget about the Syrian conflict? It is not ruled out that it will be necessary to return to it soon. They are still fighting there over the same strategic points as a year ago. The clash over Crimea will most likely convince the Americans that in a certain sense it is necessary to return to Cold War tactics, when they did much less bombing. Back then, systematic work was conducted to create a military alliance and strengthen its aggregate power so as to have the possibility of putting pressure on your opponent not through raids but with your might. I think we could probably see something similar. First and foremost in regard to China, not Russia. The period of crazy activism when it was thought that it is easier to send in the aircraft or the expeditionary corps is in the past, it seems to me. At the end of last year Putin was recognized as the number one politician in the world. Will he retain the title this year? In the West, even before these events, there was a kind of reverential attitude to Putin as an omnipotent opponent. Now this is only growing stronger. The problem is that Putin's rating is much higher than Russia's own rating. In order to change this, it is necessary radically to reduce the level of corruption and bureaucratization in the country and give people the opportunity to fulfil themselves in business. Then Russia's rating will catch up with Putin's and even surpass it.

88bc7059-5a78-471c-8d89-a54c07f24b63,"ATHENS--Russia has only made a ""token"" withdrawal of troops from Ukraine's eastern border, U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Friday. Earlier this week, the top military commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization warned that with some 40,000 Russian troops massed near Ukraine's border, Russia could take large swathes of Ukraine in three to five days. Speaking on his way into a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Athens, Mr. Hague said there has been no ""real de-escalation"" of Russian pressure on Ukraine recently, saying the situation ""remains very tense."" There has been ""only a token withdrawal so far"" of Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border, Mr. Hague said. After Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow has no intention of sending troops further into Ukraine. Moscow has denied it is deliberately massing troops near Ukraine, saying the presence of its forces there is due to military exercises. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton urged Russia to withdraw troops from the border as a key step to de-escalate tensions. ""The description that somehow troops are moving back has not been verified by NATO, and it is really important that Russia shows that it is serious about the de-escalation by moving troops back,"" she said. ""But we'll be watching with great care what's happening there."" Mr. Hague said it was important for European policy makers to keep up their work preparing a third phase of broader economic sanctions against Russia that go beyond the individual travel bans and asset freezes already announced. However, he said the EU shouldn't impose the broader sanctions yet. ""This moment isn't the moment for phase three of sanctions but they have to be ready,"" he said. That view was echoed by Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans. ""I think the measures taken are proportionate to what are needed for the time being,"" he told reporters. ""In the middle of a crisis you need to stick to a strategy and not change course."" He said the bloc could impose further individual sanctions if Russia refused to ""come to the negotiating table,"" over its pressure on Ukraine. Mr. Timmermans also said the EU needs to stick by its pledges to offer assistance to Ukraine, whose economy faces serious challenges. Ukraine's interim government is seeking a medium-term loan program with the International Monetary Fund. The EU, the U.S. and others have also offered assistance. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters Friday that ""although the bloodletting on the streets of Ukraine has stopped, the country is facing...maybe years of difficulty."" Mr. Steinmeier said he believes Russia is seeking some form of de-escalation of tensions. However with Russian state-run gas giant OAO Gazprom raising the price of gas exports to Ukraine Thursday for the second time this week, Mr. Steinmeier was left hoping that the EU ""can convince Russia that it's in its own interests not to have an crippled nation on its doorstep."" The EU and U.S. had originally sought to enlist Russia in a broad international support package for Kiev. But those hopes evaporated when Moscow refused to recognize the interim authorities who took over in Kiev after the ousting of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in late February. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Friday he hopes the EU will agree to offer other partners the 90-day visa-free travel access to most EU countries that Moldova was formally offered on Thursday. Moldovan citizens will enjoy that easier visa access from May."
5e0ae3fb-2c44-4df4-a464-b5102289c5d9,"News Stories and Documents By RFE/RL March 16, 2014 The United States and the European Union have reiterated they will not recognize the results of Crimea's referendum on seceding from Ukraine, while Moscow has dug in with a vow to ""respect"" the choice made by Crimean voters. A U.S. official said that Secretary of State John Kerry, in a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov early on March 16, urged Moscow to pull back its military forces and let Ukrainians undertake reforms that would protect the rights of minorities and determine how political power is to be shared. Kerry also reportedly raised ""strong concerns"" about Russian military activities in a region bordering Crimea on March 15, as well as ""the continuing provocations in eastern cities in Ukraine."" In Kyiv, meanwhile, Ukrainian officials have warned that they will bring to justice separatists and insurrectionists ""and Russia will not save them."" ""All cheerleaders of separatism and division who now, shielded by Russian soldiers, are attempting to destroy Ukrainian independence, we will find them all -- regardless if it takes a year or two years -- we will bring them to justice and we will try them at the Ukrainian and international courts,"" Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. ""The earth will burn under their feet."" He added: ""Together with our Western partners, we will do everything possible to make sure that everyone who today feels protected enough by Russian guns to do whatever they please knows that they will have to answer for separatism and attempts to destroy the constitutional order. No place in the world will be safe enough for them to disregard the law. And Russia will not save them."" In the referendum, Crimea's pro-Russian authorities said voter turnout was more than 60 percent by mid-afternoon. Crimeans Vote In Disputed Referendumi March 16, 2014 Voters in the Ukrainian republic of Crimea faced a referendum on March 16 called by the pro-Moscow, breakaway parliament there on whether the region should join Russia. Russian troops currently occupy the peninsula. Many among Crimea's ethnic Tatar population and pro-Kyiv Ukrainians were expected to boycott the vote. Crimea's pro-Russian Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov said the regional parliament will confirm the referendum outcome at a session on March 17. ""Today, the agenda of the development of the autonomy is already being discussed with our Russian colleagues . Tomorrow at 10 o'clock we will be holding a parliamentary session that will adopt the results of the referendum and a number of other organizational issues,"" Aksyonov said. ""I believe we will present a full program of actions within a day or two. All is clear for us. Now we need this thing to proceed quietly and nicely. We'll toast the whole thing tonight."" In Brussels, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy in a joint statement reiterated that the 28-nation bloc considers the referendum ""illegal and illegitimate."" They said EU foreign ministers will decide ""on additional measures"" against Moscow on March 17. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a telephone call on March 16 that the referendum complies with international law and that Moscow will ""respect"" the choice of Crimean voters. Russian forces have been occupying Crimea since late last month. Ukraine's acting defense minister says there are currently some 22,000 Russian troops there. In the referendum, voters are being asked whether Crimea -- where ethnic Russians are about 60 percent of the population -- should break away from Ukraine and join Russia or opt for greater autonomy. The pro-Russian authorities in Crimea said that by two hours before polls were to close, voter turnout was over 70 percent. Many among Crimea's ethnic Tatar population and pro-Kyiv Ukrainians were expected to boycott the vote. The Kremlin said that in his telephone call with Merkel, Putin also voiced concern over tensions in Ukraine's south and southeast, which he said were being ""inflamed by radical groups with the connivance of Kiyv's authorities."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Lavrov, in his telephone conversation with Kerry, urged Washington to use its influence on Ukraine's authorities to make them stop what he called ""massive lawlessness"" toward the Russian-speaking population. A German government spokesman said Putin welcomed the German chancellor's proposal to swiftly expand the existing Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europea observer mission in Ukraine, especially in the east of the country. As voters in Crimea cast ballots, pro-Russian demonstrators rallied in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Luhansk, and the Black Sea port city of Odesa. In Donetsk, pro-Russian protesters stormed the regional prosecutor's office and the local headquarters of Ukraine's security service demanding the release of the self-appointed pro-Moscow ""governor."" Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on March 16 also urged the deployment of more OSCE observers to the east and south of Ukraine, including Crimea.

5735654e-eb23-4f7a-99e4-adbddfb090cc,"MOSCOW -- Top Russian officials and some of the country's wealthiest tycoons have been scrambling to assess the potential fallout of Western sanctions on an already sputtering economy. But insiders say that President Vladimir Putin isn't hearing their concerns. Instead, the Russian leader appears focused on making the breakaway Ukrainian region of Crimea part of Russia once again despite the costs, some of which are already being felt. ""Everyone's worried about the sanctions,"" said one senior government official. ""But there is no way to convey that concern up to the one who's making the decisions because he's surrounded by loyalists."" Since Russian forces took control of Crimea on Feb. 28, markets in Moscow have plunged to levels not seen since the global economic crisis, with the top 50 companies shedding $110 billion in capitalization. The ruble has hit record lows and many economists have slashed their 2014 growth forecasts by more than half. And that is before any sanctions have even been introduced. The increased nervousness within Russia's business community comes as Western leaders have turned up the volume in recent days on the threat of sanctions, seeking to head off a referendum in Crimea on Sunday on seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday urged Russia to change its course on Ukraine, saying to do otherwise would ""massively damage Russia economically and politically."" The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also put Russia's bid to join the group on hold. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that promised sanctions could make things ""get ugly fast"" for Russia and President Barack Obama has insisted that the sanctions threat has already been felt deeply in Moscow. But so far, Mr. Putin has shown no sign of backing down from increasingly tough talk coming from the West, and appears ready once again to dismiss complaints from Russia's moguls. The government official said those in Mr. Putin's inner circle are convinced they have a historic opportunity to regain Crimea, a territory ceded to Ukraine only in 1954, and see the possible economic cost as less important. A spokesman for the Russian president acknowledged that the country's leading businessmen had been in ""constant contact with the government"" about sanctions but said Mr. Putin had not met with any of them. A person who attended a recent meeting between some of Russia's richest industrialists and high-ranking government officials to discuss the overall economy said the mood turned tense when the issue of sanctions was brought up. ""Questions were asked about how the situation with Ukraine might further affect the market and how the government might respond,"" the person said. ""People wanted to know exactly how things might go."" On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin -- whose portfolio includes the defense industry -- said he met with the heads of Russia's weapons manufacturers and told them that sanctions would be just as damaging to the West as they would be to Russia. The scope of any economic measures remains to be seen. Western leaders have publicly discussed targeted sanctions against those deemed responsible for the takeover of Crimea. Still, veteran bankers in Russia say the threat alone has taken its toll on Russia's already sluggish economy. ""Even if they all start kissing and making up now, the momentum of the events of the last month means that any hope of the cavalry storming in and saving the day in terms of economic growth for this year has gone out the window,"" said one senior banking adviser in Moscow. ""The damage has already been done."" Russia was already dealing with slowing growth, rising inflation, a weakening ruble and persistent capital flight. Economic growth last year clocked in at an anemic 1%, and Russia's central bank has forecast just 1% growth this year. Russia's primary stock index plummeted 11% on March 3, the first day of trading after Russian troops entered Crimea, and has lost ground since. The ruble has declined 11% against the dollar since the beginning of the year and the central bank was forced to spend $11billion on the day of the market plunge to stabilize the currency. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin said in a meeting with the heads of Russia's central bank, finance ministry and economy ministry that the current rate of growth wasn't good enough, and ""we need to achieve stronger dynamics."" Russian officials have publicly brushed off the impact sanctions might have and have said they are preparing what Deputy Economy Minister Alexei Likhachev on Thursday called a symmetric response. Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said Russia had made great efforts in recent years to minimize the impact of political risk on the economy through diversifying its trading partners. He said the economy was now far more vulnerable to shifts in the global economy than to direct sanctions from the West. Regardless of what happens, Russia's already tarnished reputation among foreign investors is likely to suffer more, said Charles Robertson, chief economist and equity strategist for Renaissance Capital. ""The negative impact isn't coming from sanctions at all. The negative impact here is more from the perception of Russia from the main sources of global capital as a tough place to justify investment,"" he said. ""This takes 5% at the very least off the value of Russian assets for a long time to come."" In a recent research note, Deutsche Bank's John-Paul Smith advised clients to steer clear of Russia entirely and suggested no longer considering it an emerging market but rather a riskier frontier market.

The March 2 meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's main political decision-making body, is at the request of Poland. Warsaw has said it feels threatened by any potential Russian military intervention in neighboring Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced the meeting on March 1 on Twitter, saying: ""Urgent need for de-escalation in Crimea."" ""Russia must respect Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, & borders,"" he added. A meeting of the NATO-Ukraine commission is to be held on March 3 in Brussels. The NATO meetings come amid a flurry of Western diplomatic activity in response to the Ukranian crisis and fears Russia might intervene militarily. Live Blog: Ukraine On The Brink Those fears rose on March 1 after Russia's upper house of parliament gave President Vladimir Putin approval to deploy troops to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine and Russian naval forces based in the country's Crimea region. Diplomacy Earlier, Ukraine's Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh accused Russia of sending 6,000 troops and 30 armored personnel carriers into Ukraine's Crimea region since February 28 ""without warning or Ukraine's permission."" British Foreign Minister William Hague will visit Kyiv on March 2. He has called on Moscow to respect the independence of Ukraine in line with the 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by Russia, the United States, and Britain. Explainer: The Budapest Memorandum And Its Relevance To Crimea The memorandum, agreed following the collapse of the Soviet Union, engaged all three powers to respect the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the U.S. White House says that President Barack Obama had a 90-minute phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 1. Obama said the appropriate way for Russia to address any concerns in Ukraine ""is peacefully through direct engagement"" with the Ukrainian government and international mediating bodies. The U.S. president also warned that continued violation of international law by Moscow would lead to further ""political and economic isolation."" The Kremlin said Putin told Obama that Moscow will reserve its right to ""protect its interests and Russian-speaking populations"" in Ukraine. Both the United States and Canada have suspended their engagements in preparations for the G-8 Summit, currently planned for Sochi. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power accused Russia of violating its international commitments. Addressing an emergency session of the UN Security Council, she called for the ""immediate deployment"" of OSCE and UN observers to Ukraine to try to defuse the tensions there. ""It is time for the Russian intervention in Ukraine to end. The Russian military must stand down, the aspirations of the Ukrainian people must be respected, and political dialogue must be allowed to continue,"" Power said. Ukrainian Ambassador to the UN Yuriy Sergeyev called on the Security Council to ""do everything possible"" to stop Russian ""aggression."" UN Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson called for dialogue among all parties. ""It is important to recall the mission of this organization: to always search for peaceful settlement of dispute. This is the essence of the UN Charter and should serve as our primary guide in this situation. Now is the time for cool heads to prevail,"" Eliasson said.

701ca801-77dc-4474-b739-5d7e1c08ac6f,"CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN HOST: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the program. So what is next for Ukraine? Will Putin send in the tanks? Will the country split apart? Or can this beleaguered nation pull back from the brink where it lies squeezed between Russia and the West? A lot of questions but not so many answers. Ukraine's ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych, is still AWOL, though, in an interview this weekend, somewhere in the Ukraine, he claimed to still be president with Kiev, he said, taken over by bandits. Meantime those bandits, aka the opposition, are planning to name Ukraine's new government on Tuesday and for now they've issued an arrest warrant for Yanukovych after charging him with the mass killing of 88 people. Both protesters and police all gunned down in street battles last week. The United States and Europe are warning Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and they're frantically trying to come up with an aid package to tide the nation over because Yanukovych leaves Ukraine in a desperate hole. Take a look at this, troves of files fished out of a lake by divers documenting the fugitive president's lavish spending. Now the interim finance minister says Ukraine will need $35 billion in foreign aid by the end of next year. I'm joined now from New York by Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Yuriy Sergeyev, who today is asking many of the same critical questions. Ambassador, welcome; thank you very much for joining me. And may I start by asking you do you even know who you are working for right now? Do you accept that a new government will be presented tomorrow and it is one that you will be able to work for? YURIY SERGEYEV, UKRAINE AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: Thank you for inviting me. I used to work and I keep working for the state and for the people, not for the leaders and the governments. We are waiting for the new government to be appointed tomorrow. AMANPOUR: And how do you think that that is going to go? Is that going to be accepted? Do you believe that Ukraine is on a political path that will be constructed? Or are we still caught in a lot of instability? SERGEYEV: I'm absolutely sure that we have a lot of wisdom to keep the path for recovering from all these clashes, understanding well the roots of the social protests and to keep Ukraine going in the direction which could satisfy all the citizens of Ukraine from the west to the east, from the north to the south. AMANPOUR: So then, let me ask you, do you feel like many have voiced fears that there could be some kind of a split? Some people have posited the notion of not just a civil war, but that Russia might intervene in any which way, whether it's militarily or with influence, to try to prise the Russian-dominated eastern part of Ukraine away. Do you think that's a possibility? SERGEYEV: Thank you for that question because really, at these days, Russian propaganda, which is covering seriously Ukrainian information sphere, keep telling that we are to displayed it, that the process was launched. And luckily we have good signs. Let me quote you today's briefing of the governor of the biggest region of the East, Donetsk region, Andriy Schyschatskyi. He stated he following, I quote, ""Today, fortunately, we have stayed at least one legitimate authority in Ukraine, where Verkhovna Rada -- the southern parliament -- and today the only way to get away from this race is to enact legislation in the parliament. It is important to preserve the integrity and independence."" What he said reflects the real story, people, they don't want any civil war. People want to be united because people who were in the streets, they faced the same problem in their life. AMANPOUR: So that seems to be good news that you're feeling fairly confident of that, and of course President Putin has spoken with Angela Merkel and obviously the U.S. has been speaking to the foreign minister there and warning them to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity. But on the issue of where Ukraine sits as I said squeezed between Russia and the West, all of this started because President Yanukovych, former President Yanukovych, at the last minute, did not sign that association agreement with the E.U. Can Ukraine be someone or a country that has great relations with the West and great relations with Russia as well? The main trend, the main direction is to be associated with the European Union. There is -- this is exactly what we had in our legislation formally. This is what the previous government and the president tried to pursue the population. Now it is not logical to divide Ukraine either to Europe or to Russia or with Russia. So this is not alternative. We are for sure with Europe but we should have a good neighborhood relations with Russia as well. AMANPOUR: So what about this massive hole that Ukraine is in, the new interim finance minister says that your country's going to need some of that $35 billion of aid in the next year and a half, by the end of 2015. Who's going to give that to you, do you think? What is Ukraine going to have to do in terms of structural and political reforms? SERGEYEV: First of all, we had to learn exactly what happened last year the government, previous government, kept saying that we are in the raise that economy is getting good stance. But now we discovered that it is not -- it was not true. What should we do now? To retain confidence from our foreign and domestic investors, to attract the recovery of economy in general? Then we are to conduct the negotiations which were stopped with the IMF. We are to conduct the negotiations with European Union to get support from there. We had from both IMF and from European Union the recent statements about their readiness to help Ukraine. But not in the way to give just money, but money could -- which could work to help Ukraine to make necessary forum and to have a stable development in all our spheres. AMANPOUR: Ambassador, I just want to refer back to a few questions before I asked you, and you seemed to answer with an implicit criticism of the Yanukovych government, that they had done things which simply were not acceptable. Are you surprised by the level of corruption that has now been uncovered, personal corruption? And are you surprised by the violence and the order that was given by somebody to fire on those protesters using live bullets? The recent discoveries of Ukrainian journalists and just show by your channel, so shocked many, many because the demonstrative stance of President Yanukovych was, well, if you're a Christian, who was visiting churches, praying for the people, but as we know now that he prayed for them, but did absolutely different. He thought about only his wealth. He collected luxury cars in amount which comparable to Brezhnev. So even his own party was shocked with that and still there is a big faction, more than 100 people of his former party, that made a statement which so strong that explains the real situation that even his surroundings is surprise and started to reshuffle themselves and to separate themselves from what he did. Let me just quote a few things. I quote the statement of detection of the Party of Regions, it's from their official website. ""Ukraine was betrayed and people were forced to rebel. And all responsibility is in the hands of Viktor Yanukovych and his close circle."" The members of the -- the members of the -- of the Party of Regions strongly condemn the criminal orders which led to human losses, political and economic crises and put Ukraine on the brink of collapse leading to the threat of separation. This is what appears yesterday on the official site of the party. AMANPOUR: Well, it's very strong stuff, Ambassador, and clearly many people condemning Yanukovych for his responsibility in this regard. Just briefly and finally, do you feel that the new government will be able to lead Ukraine forward? We've seen reformist governments in the past collapse into squabbling sort of, you know, sort of, you know, they couldn't -- they couldn't move their way beyond their own political arguments. There should, as I stated yesterday at the big Ukrainian manifestation here in New York, this is exactly the time when Ukraine is fighting for its real independence. And to keep this independence, we should build this sustainable situation both in social, political, financial and economic. And we need to be united. AMANPOUR: Ambassador Sergeyev, thank you so much indeed for joining me. AMANPOUR: And so while Ukraine's president, as we said, has gone missing, Uganda's president is still on the job and wielding his pen to sign off on one of the world's toughest anti-gay laws. But laws aren't just made of ink and paper. They are flesh and blood with real human consequences for people like Kasha Nabagesera, one of the leading LGBT activists in Uganda and her partner. And this is Akram Kalungi, a Muslim shown here with his partner. You can see more photos of Uganda from this series at our website, amanpour.com. How will Uganda's harsh new law change their lives? AMANPOUR: Welcome back to the program. Uganda's president threatened to do it, and today he did it, criminalizing homosexuality, thumbing his nose at international pressure, Yoweri Museveni invited the international press to witness him sign one of the world's toughest anti-gay laws while claiming that Uganda is standing up to Western imperialism. YOWERI MUSEVENI, UGANDAN PRESIDENT: These are now an attempt at social imperialism, to impose social values of one group on our society. AMANPOUR: Rhetoric aside, this law is brutal, drawing sentences of 14 years to life in prison. The White House today called the law abhorrent and said Museveni took Uganda a step backward. As the law was being drafted, I asked President Museveni whether it would lead to the abuse of gays in Uganda. MUSEVENI: What does the world not agree with us about? Because I have told you, there is no discrimination. Certainly there is no killing. AMANPOUR: As you can see, this drafting has taken a long, long time. But now the law is on the books. Can gay Ugandans and their families now expect what's happening in Nigeria, where terrifying tales of torture and abuse have followed their president's signing an anti-gay law last month? I just reached out to Pepe Julian Onziema, a prominent gay activist in Uganda, who, like many in his community, are staying behind closed doors today. AMANPOUR: Pepe Julian Onziema, thank you very much for joining me from Uganda. You've seen what's happened in Nigeria since President Goodluck Jonathan has signed that law in there, criminalizing homosexuality. There have been all sorts of lynchings and torture and abuse. What are people saying to you in your own community about what they fear? PEPE JULIAN ONZIEMA, GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST: They fear that as well because we've had cases of -- call it attempted mob justice because people have intervened before the actual mob justice had had been. So people are afraid of losing their lives. Those who are felt that it's going to happen to them within their neighborhoods have left the country. They've fled to the nearest border where they feel much safer. Some of them have walked away or moved away from public life. Even with us, people call you to tell you don't call me again. I'm not going to be part of -- part of this advocacy anymore because I do not want to get in trouble. So people are really afraid about losing their lives, losing their families, those who are especially who are in the closet, people have lost jobs and their livelihoods have basically changed. And those are the same people who are committing suicide. Like people attempted suicide because they are like, I'm not going to live to see this country kill me. So I'd rather take my life. AMANPOUR: And what about you, speaking publicly right now? I mean, you theoretically could be prosecuted for advocating homosexuality, for any kind of criminal offense under this new law. But I'm not afraid, because I'm not doing something wrong. Speaking out is my right that is guaranteed in the constitution, and this law is not going to take away the person that I am and it's not going to take away my voice. And even if I'm arrested for being on a call right now with you, I will serve. But my conscience will be very clear. AMANPOUR: Pepe Julian Onziema, thank you very much for joining me. AMANPOUR: And here's a troubling thought. While President Museveni accuses the United States of trying to import social imperialism into Uganda by defending homosexual rights, who do you think is behind some of the anti-gay hysteria in Uganda right now? A group of evangelical Christians from that very same hotbed of social imperialism, the United States of America. My next guest, Roger Ross Williams, belonged to the organization called International House of Prayer in Missouri, whose missionary zeal fell on gays in Uganda. He decided to make a film about what he learned, and he called it, ""God Loves Uganda."" It ended up being a terrifying look at incitement to hatred. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to fight sodomy in Uganda. They say they are ready to fight. Those who are ready to kill those who are being homosexual, stand up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole world has got its eyes on Uganda because of what has happened to David Kato. David's death is a result of the hatred planted in Uganda by U.S. evangelicals. AMANPOUR: So he was referring to a prominent gay activist who was killed a long while ago there in Uganda. That was powerful stuff and the director, Roger Ross Williams, joins me from Albany right now. Thank you for coming on the program today. You know, your film was done as this law was being drafted. What do you think is going to happen now in Uganda? ROGER ROSS WILLIAMS, DIRECTOR, ""GOD LOVES UGANDA"": I'm having trouble hearing you. Let me just put it -- let me put it very bluntly. Tell me how you came to make this film and how you discovered what you have done. Well, I was -- my last film took place in Zimbabwe and I noticed a hold of sort of type of evangelical Christianity on the continent, sub-Saharan Africa. So I started reading about Uganda and what was going on there. And I just did a research trip, went there; met David Kato, who's the activist in my film, who was brutally murdered. And he said the story that hadn't been told is the story of the sort of damage that fundamentalists, evangelicals from America, were doing in his country. So that sort of started me on my journey. AMANPOUR: What did you know about the International House of Prayer? How did you see that sort of build there? WILLIAMS: The build, you know, well, I started on -- I, when I heard about Lou Engel from the International House of Prayer in Kansas City going to Uganda, you know, sort of when all these sort of American evangelicals were running away from Uganda for PR reasons, he went to Uganda and threw a huge prayer rally called The Call, which that led me to Kansas City. And I sort of started following members from the International House of Prayer and I followed a group of them to Uganda. AMANPOUR: And I know it's all in your film, but for those of us who -- or people who haven't seen the whole film, describe how it worked. How did they sort of gin up this anti-gay hysteria? How did an evangelical from the United States get to spend hours talking to parliament in Uganda? WILLIAMS: Well, someone who is very extreme, like Scott Lively, who is an extremist in America, but in -- when he goes to Uganda, he gets taken seriously because of what he represents. He's an American evangelical, and what America represents in a place like Uganda, represents power and wealth. And so he goes to Uganda and he can command the president, he can command the parliament for five hours. He did a three-day conference, where he told everyone about the threat of homosexuality, that they were there to recruit their children. And that's what really sort of started this whole bill on its -- on where it is now, today, this sort of tragic day. And Scott Lively's being sued in American federal court by Ugandan activists for what he's done there. A judge just ruled that he has to stand trial. AMANPOUR: Now in your film, you also talk to very sympathetic Ugandans, members of the Anglican Church there, who try to tell their flock that, no, this anti-gay hysteria is not Christian. Do they have any chance of getting that message across? WILLIAMS: I heard you have a -- were you talking about Bishop Christopher Ssenyonjo? You know, Bishop Christopher Ssenyonjo is an Anglican bishop who sort of went against the grain in Uganda. You have a bunch of pastors there who call themselves anti-gay activists, who show, like Martin Ssempa, who shows gay porn in church, who just sort of firing up people to -- as gay people have become this sort of scapegoat in Uganda, to distract from what the real problems are going on there, which is corruption. So you have Christopher Ssenyonjo, who is the only -- one of the only faith leaders who stood up and said, you know, this is human sexuality. And for that, he lost his -- he actually lost his right in the Anglican Church. And here's a really noble man and he won the Clinton award last year. But this is an amazing man who is -- was on the front page of a newspaper called the ""Rolling Stone"" with David Kato, the murdered activist, with his picture next to David Kato's, with the title, ""Hanging Killed Him."" AMANPOUR: You know what, your film is incredibly interesting and amazingly timely. Roger Ross Williams, thank you so much indeed for joining me today. AMANPOUR: And after a break, imagine if beautiful music not only made your life richer, it was instrumental in saving your life. The musical bridge between two remarkable women who not only survived the Nazi horrors but lived to inspire the world, the sound and the power of music when we come back. AMANPOUR: Welcome back to the program. And a final note tonight: AMANPOUR : That's well-known and well-loved music and the hills may indeed be alive with the sound of that music. But imagine a world where music can bring life even to the darkest valleys. AMANPOUR: Maria von Trapp, the last survivor of the seven brothers and sisters portrayed in the much-loved 1965 film died last week at the age of 99. She shared her name with her stepmother, the governess who was portrayed by Julie Andrews, who married Captain von Trapp and fled Austria with the rest of the family after the Nazi occupation. As the Trapp Family Singers, they then toured and entertained the world. It was that same love of music that saved the life of Alice Hurt Summer, the world's oldest pianist and oldest known Holocaust survivor. Like Maria, she was born into a musical family. And being Jewish, she became a target of the Nazis. In 1943, she, her husband and her son, were sent to a concentration camp. Because of her musical talent, Alice was placed in the camp orchestra, performing for inmates and guards alike. Somehow she kept her little boy with her, even though her husband was shipped off to Auschwitz. Later, he died in Dachau. After liberation by the Allies, Alice eventually settled here in Britain, still playing the piano nearly every day until her death this weekend at the age of 110. And also like Maria von Trapp, her story is now a film, ""The Lady in Number Six,"" a documentary that's nominated for one of this year's Academy Awards.

10909d2a-34a6-4b61-bb71-1123d1d8599d,"After months of speculation, the U.S. State Department announced in July that it had found Russia to be in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty over Moscow's testing of a new medium-range, ground-launched cruise missile . The accusation comes at a time of heightened U.S.-Russian tensions over Moscow's support for separatist forces in Ukraine. ""We have been attempting to address this very serious matter with Russia for some time, as the United States is wholly committed to the continued viability of the INF Treaty,"" Rose Gottemoeller, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said Aug. In remarks to a symposium at U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, Nebraska, she said the Obama administration was ""asking Russia to return to compliance with the treaty in a verifiable manner."" Gottemoeller said that the two countries previously ""have been down the road of needless, costly, and destabilizing arms races."" She added, ""We know where that road leads and we are fortunate that our past leaders had the wisdom and strength to turn us in a new direction."" The INF Treaty, signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, marked the first time the two superpowers agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals and utilize extensive on-site inspections for verification. The treaty, which is still in force, eliminated almost 2,700 intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, most of them Russia's. U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone about the INF Treaty on Aug. 1, according to the White House. According to a July 28 New York Times report, Obama sent Putin a letter that day in which Obama asked for a high-level dialogue with Moscow to discuss ways to preserve the treaty and bring Russia back into compliance. In an interview in early August, a diplomatic source familiar with the treaty controversy said senior Russian and U.S. officials are expected to meet in September to discuss the issue. U.S. Allegation Unspecified The Obama administration alleges that Russia is violating its INF Treaty obligation ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a GLCM with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers or ""to possess or produce launchers of such missiles,"" as a State Department report sent to Congress in July summarized it. At a meeting in early July, the Principals Committee, which includes the national security adviser, the defense secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretary of state, and the CIA director, ""unanimously agreed"" that the cruise missile flight test was a ""serious violation,"" the Times said. A senior administration official told Arms Control Today on July 29 that the intelligence community has ""high confidence"" in the assessment. The State Department report, which surveys compliance with arms control agreements by the United States and other countries, did not specify the type of cruise missile in question or say how many tests have been conducted or when they occurred. The senior administration official said that the testing took place at the Kapustin Yar test site in western Russia. According to the Times story, Russia began testing the cruise missile as early as 2008, and the administration concluded that it was a compliance concern by the end of 2011, although officials do not believe the missile has been deployed. Gottemoeller first raised the issue with Russian officials in May 2013, according to the Times. Unconfirmed reports have focused on Russia's R-500 Iskander-K short-range cruise missile as the missile that precipitated the U.S. allegation. That system uses a road-mobile launcher, similar to the Iskander-M, which is a short-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile. Russia reportedly is deploying the Iskander-M near Luga, south of St. Petersburg, near Russia's borders with NATO member countries in response to U.S. missile defense plans. It is not clear if the range of the R-500 exceeds the lower limit of the INF Treaty. In the August interview, the diplomatic source said that according to the United States, the R-500 is not the focus of the allegation. That appears to be consistent with other available information on the allegation and the history of the R-500. According to the Times report, the GLCM considered to be a violation was first tested in 2008 and has not been deployed. The R-500 reportedly was first tested in May 2007 and deployed in 2013. At an April 29 congressional hearing, Rep. Brad Sherman offered an alternative explanation of the nature of the alleged violation and the platform involved. He said that Russia claims to have tested a new intermediate-range missile for use at sea, which is allowed under the INF Treaty if the missile is tested from a test launcher, but that Moscow used ""what appears to be an operational, usable ground-based launcher,"" which is not allowed. Sherman said that ""it appears as if were developing a ground-based capacity for this intermediate missile."" Russia Denies Charges Russia denies that it is breaching the INF treaty. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a July 28 statement that the allegations are ""as baseless as all of Washington's claims that have lately been reaching Moscow. Absolutely no proof has been provided."" The United States has accused Moscow of providing military support to rebel forces in eastern Ukraine, including the surfaceto- air missile that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July. ""We have many complaints to make to the United States with regard to the Treaty,"" the statement continued. ""These include missile defense target missiles having characteristics similar to those of shorter- and intermediate-range missiles and the production by the Americans of armed drones which clearly fall under the land-based cruise missiles"" in the INF Treaty, the ministry said. Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, told Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staffon July 31 that Moscow was committed to adhering to the INF Treaty, Reuters reported. According to the diplomatic source, Gerasimov expressed concern about U.S. plans to field the Mark-41 missile launcher in Romania and Poland as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, the Obama administration's policy for missile defense in Europe. 1 statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry, the sea-based MK-41 ""can be used to launch intermediate-range cruise missiles, but groundlaunched version will be a gross violation of the INF Treaty."" The MK-41 is currently used on U.S. Navy ships to launch missile defense interceptors, such as the Standard Missile-3, but it is also used to launch the Tomahawk intermediate-range cruise missile. As a sea-based missile, the Tomahawk does not run afoul of the INF Treaty. But once the MK-41 is based on land, as the United States plans to do next year, it would, in Russia's view, conflict with the INF Treaty's prohibition on possessing a groundbased launcher for intermediate-range cruise missiles. The United States has not responded publicly to the Russian allegations. It is not clear if the land-based MK-41 would maintain its capability to launch intermediate-range cruise missiles or if the United States intends to modify the launcher to eliminate this capability. Hill Response In response to the State Department's charge against Russia, Sen. Marco Rubio said in a July 31 press release that Russia's action ""cannot go unanswered."" Along with Sens. Jim Risch and Orrin Hatch , Rubio introduced legislation that would, among other things, initiate U.S. research and development on missiles banned by the INF Treaty. Such work is allowed under the pact. Congress does not appear to be pressuring the administration to withdraw from the INF Treaty to protest Russia's actions, in part because there is an apparent political consensus that the best outcome for the United States would be for Moscow to come back into compliance. ""I do not believe the appropriate remedy in this case is for the United States to withdraw from the treaty,"" Stephen Rademaker, an official in the George W. Bush administration, told the House Armed Services Committee on July 17. ""Rather, since Russia so clearly wants out, we should make sure that they alone pay the political and diplomatic price of terminating the treaty."" Last summer, Sergey Ivanov, the Kremlin chief of staff, publicly questioned the value of the treaty, saying Russia has more potential threats on its borders than the United States does. ""The Americans have no need for this class of weapon they didn't need it before and they don't need it now,"" Ivanov said, according to RIA Novosti. ""They could theoretically only attack Mexico and Canada with them, because their effective radius doesn't extend to Europe."" Russia has indicated that another answer to its concerns might to be to expand the membership of the treaty. In 2007, Russia and the United States issued a statement at the UN General Assembly reaffirming their ""support"" for the treaty and calling on all other states to join them in renouncing the missiles banned by the treaty.-TOM Z.

8efb7610-53b6-4bc6-8d60-30ff2b2b591e,"Face-to-face talks between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents failed to produce a breakthrough for ending the conflict over eastern Ukraine, as Kiev released videos of captured Russian soldiers and rebels pushed toward a government-held city. The one-on-one session, which Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko described as ""tough and complex,"" ended early Wednesday after a day of talks on the crisis in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. Mr. Poroshenko said afterward that he would prepare a ""road map"" toward a possible cease-fire with the pro-Russia separatists, according to a statement carried by news agencies. Russia's President Vladimir Putin expressed support as well as apparent skepticism. ""Russia will do everything possible for the peace process, if it begins,"" he told reporters separately, adding that it ""should get started as soon as possible."" Mr. Putin also played down the significance of the Russian troops caught on the Ukrainian side of the border this week. Just ahead of the talks, Ukraine released videotaped interrogations of the soldiers, who it said were part of a column of Russian infantry vehicles that its forces had attacked on Monday. The Russian Defense Ministry said the soldiers had strayed accidentally into Ukraine while patrolling an unmarked section of the border, according to the news agency Interfax. ""Ukrainian servicemen happened to be on our territory as well. It was never a problem and I hope that in this case it won't be a problem from the Ukrainian side,"" Mr. Putin said, apparently referring to recent incidents when Ukrainian troops crossed into Russia to escape rebel fire. The two leaders, together for the first time in two months, were joined by officials from the European Union, Belarus and Kazakhstan in an attempt to end the bloodshed in Ukraine, which has flared into the biggest East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. But Mr. Putin focused on trade issues during the initial round-table discussion, sidestepping mounting concern over the insurrection that has claimed an estimated 2,000 lives this year. In his public comments, Mr. Putin highlighted the dangers he said Russia faces if Ukraine pursues closer ties to the West. Since the onset of the crisis, Mr. Putin has accused the West of meddling in Ukraine's internal affairs and trying to spoil its relations with Moscow. Mr. Putin said that a trade agreement between Kiev and Europe will flood the Ukrainian market with European goods, which may then find their way into Russia. ""In this situation Russia cannot stand idle. And we will be prompted . to take retaliatory measures, to protect our market,"" Mr. Putin said. In a seemingly conciliatory sign after their face-to-face talks, however, Mr. Putin said he and Mr. Poroshenko agreed to restart talks on natural-gas deliveries. Moscow cut off supplies to its neighbor earlier this year, claiming that Kiev has to repay mounting debt. Ukraine's latest political crisis began after Ukraine's previous president, Viktor Yanukovych, abruptly moved late last year to sign a trade agreement with Russia instead of the EU. Mr. Yanukovych was toppled in February after months of street protests. Mr. Poroshenko, elected in May, has since revived the agreement with Europe. At the same time, Ukraine is battling an insurgency in the east that began in April. Kiev accuses Russia of funneling men and arms across the border to support the separatists, a charge Russia denies. The round-table discussion was followed by a four-hour private meeting. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said afterward that Minsk would serve as the setting for continued talks. ""Of course all of us would like a breakthrough,"" including a cease-fire and ""a start to political dialogue in Ukraine,"" Mr. Lukashenko said. ""But the fact of today's meeting itself is a success, a step in the only proper direction."" Ukrainian defense officials reported new fighting Tuesday near the port city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea -- which for weeks they have said was solidly under government control. Andriy Lysenko said a column of Russian armored vehicles and artillery was shelling army positions a few dozen miles from the city. Lysenko said Ukrainian forces had destroyed much of the column Monday after it had crossed the border, but that some remaining tanks and howitzers were firing on Ukrainian units from villages near the border. Russia denies sending the vehicles across the border. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior Interior Ministry official, said in televised comments that the Russian armor brought into Ukraine to support the assault was a relatively small column, and looked less like an invasion than an attempt to sow panic. In the videotapes, the soldiers said they were part of a paratroop unit based in Kostroma, about 210 miles northeast of Moscow. They said they had been ordered to the Ukrainian border for military exercises, and had been given uniforms stripped of any indications that they were Russian military units. One of the soldiers said they knew they were heading into Ukraine, but another said they thought they were on an exercise inside Russia. ""They started shooting at us, and my vehicle blew up,"" said one. ""Then I knew this wasn't an exercise; it wasn't just a march."" James Marson in Mariupol, Ukraine, contributed to this article.

f180f725-b26d-4b67-885a-23c1575408c3,"The last time the U.S. accused Russia of downing a civilian airliner, nuclear war nearly broke out. The most bizarre conspiracy theory surrounding the recent downing of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine comes from a leading pro-Russian separatist, Igor Girkin. Relying on second-hand information, Girkin asserted that many of the passengers from the crash had already been dead before the plane had even taken off. His underlings had reported to him that the bodies were badly decomposed and drained of blood. This, of course, was news to all the families of the victims who'd seen offtheir loved ones at the airport in Amsterdam. The separatists have denied responsibility for shooting down the plane and have pinned the crime instead on the Ukrainian government. Until recently, the rebels restricted access to the crash scene and the bodies, which gave them ample opportunities to tamper with the evidence-such as sawing the cockpit in half and lugging away pieces of the plane. Now that the bodies are in the hands of outside investigators, presumably the rebels have moved on to more plausible exculpatory explanations. The United States, meanwhile, argues that it has conclusive proof that the rebels not only shot down the plane but also gloated over their success on social media . Moreover, Washington argues that Moscow is ultimately responsible for the disaster because it gave the separatists the surface-to-air missile system in the first place. Russia denies delivery of the Buk missile system and has claimed that a Ukrainian fighter jet was near the civilian airplane shortly before it was hit. The problem with the latter claim is that the fighter jet that Moscow asserts was trailing Malaysian Airlines Flight 17-a Ukrainian SU-25-couldn't actually reach that particular altitude and doesn't have the weaponry onboard capable of taking down a plane 10,000 feet further above. The Ukrainian government has denied having any missile batteries within firing range of the flight that day. But, strangely, Ukraine didn't completely shut down the airspace over the disputed territory and direct traffic to safer routes. It was permitting overflights above 32,000 feet, and Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was cruising at an altitude of 33,000. Moreover, as Russ Wellen points out in the FPIF blog Focal Points, the Ukrainian government knew that the rebels possessed the capacity to bring down planes that high up, and yet Ukrainian air traffic controllers rejected a request from MH17 to fly 2,000 feet higher. Was the government in Kiev guilty of poor judgment, or was some darker motive at play? Unless a plane completely disappears-a truly unlikely scenario until it happened to another Malaysian airliner back in March-it's usually possible to get to the bottom of air disasters with the help of black box recordings, satellite data, and the scraps of wreckage. But it takes time to siftthrough the evidence. And during that time, all manner of wild speculation can take place. Sometimes that speculation is idle and produces only flame wars on the Internet. But sometimes it can lead to a very dangerous escalation in tensions between armed combatants. I was returning to college in 1983 when news broke that the Soviet Union had shot down Korean passenger jet KAL 007, killing all 269 people on board. For a couple days in early September, the campus worried that this tragic incident would spark something even worse: a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. President Ronald Reagan had been rapidly escalating his anti-Soviet rhetoric. Soviet Premier Yuri Andropov, directing Soviet policy from his hospital bed by that point, was firmly convinced that Reagan was planning a first nuclear strike. Indeed, a false alarm later that September-Soviet satellite sensors had mistaken high-altitude clouds for incoming nuclear missiles-nearly triggered a Soviet launch. Only a single quick-thinking lieutenant colonel in Soviet military intelligence saved the world from nuclear annihilation. There were plenty of rumors back in 1983 about KAL 007. The jet had veered more than 200 miles offcourse to enter Soviet airspace, so perhaps it was gathering intelligence for the CIA or testing Soviet air defenses. Or maybe the Soviets deliberately downed the airliner knowing that it was a civilian craft. You can still find conspiracy theories on the Internet claiming that the airplane was never shot down in the first place and the Soviets had taken all the passengers into custody . After a number of exhaustive investigations, including an analysis of the black box recordings, the shooting down of KAL 007 turns out to have been the result of error, misinterpretation, and incompetence. Five years later, it was the United States' turn to engage in criminal negligence when the U.S.S. Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655 in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people on board. The Iranian government used language very similar to Reagan's in 1983, calling the attack a ""massacre"" and an ""atrocity."" The United States denied that the attack was deliberate. It eventually paid reparations to Iran and expressed regret for the incident, though it did not issue a formal apology. Here, too, it appears that errors of judgment determined the tragic outcome. The evidence that the Iranian plane was civilian should have been clear to the U.S. warship, but the chain of command was apparently so convinced that it was dealing with a military target that it ignored all contrary indicators. In this case, however, the Airbus disaster didn't escalate the war between Iran and Iraq . Within two weeks of the downing of the plane, Iran signed a UN ceasefire. The eight-year struggle was over within the next two months. The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 can produce either of these results. It can serve as a wake-up call to the combatants that, because their actions are resulting in inexcusable civilian casualties, they should negotiate an immediate truce. Or it can lead to the most serious escalation in tensions between Moscow and Washington since 1983. Back in the early 1980s, the United States was convinced that the Soviet Union was fomenting instability in an ""arc of crisis"" that stretched from the Horn of Africa to South Asia. Moscow, or so Washington asserted, was bent on seizing a warm-water port, securing access to Middle East oil, and picking up allies in its Cold War competition with the United States. It was yet another example of Washington overestimating Moscow. Certainly the Soviet Union wanted the region along its vast borders to be friendly. But there was no secret plan for Eurasian dominance. The Soviet Union was acting more out of weakness than strength when it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Its rash intervention was not the beginning of a neo-imperial surge to the south, but the beginning of the end for the overextended Soviet Union. Vladimir Putin's seizure of Crimea and involvement in eastern Ukraine-taken alongside Russia's encouragement of separatists in Georgia and Moldova and its support for Assad in Syria-might look like a sequel to the arc of crisis. And indeed some on the right are dusting offsome of the language from this period. But Putin's ambitions are circumscribed. He is not interested in reconstituting the Soviet Union, much less the former Soviet sphere of influence incorporating Eastern Europe and client states elsewhere in the world. At most, Putin wants to recreate a greater Russia, which involves some swathes of the ""near abroad."" But even that plan has its limits. Latvia and Estonia, where there are large numbers of ethnic Russians, are both firmly in the EU and NATO. Kazakhstan, home to the second largest number of Russians outside of Russia, has already proposed new laws criminalizing separatist rhetoric. And given the sheer incompetence of his Donbas allies, Ukraine may well turn into Putin's Afghanistan. What Putin has done so far in Ukraine is inexcusable. But it's not part of a plan for global or even regional domination. All of which is to say that the United States should not overreact to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. This should be an opportunity for Washington and Moscow to work together on investigating the tragedy, which Putin has agreed to do. This is a chance for the combatants to lay down their arms, which Putin has also urged. Yes, sometimes Moscow's words and deeds do not match, but Washington suffers from flare-ups of the same disease. Before this war in Ukraine claims more victims and sends U.S.-Russian relations into a deep freeze, both Obama and Putin need to realize that both sides benefit a great deal more from cooperation than confrontation. A full reset in U.S.-Russian relations is obviously not in the offing. But returning to the status quo ante that existed before the change of government in Ukraine would at least prevent a replay of those perilous scenarios of 1983.

The U.S. and European Union warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the threat of punishing new sanctions against Russia remained unless he did more to help de-escalate the crisis. But if the cease-fire holds and talks appear to be progressing, the likelihood of any quick imposition of new sanctions would diminish. The rebel announcement was broadcast live on Russian state television. ""We agree to suspend all fighting from our side"" until Friday, when the cease-fire announced June 20 is set to expire at 10 a.m. local time, said Alexander Borodai, the self-proclaimed prime minister of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, comprising Ukraine's Donetsk region. Another separatist leader said the rebels would also move to release a group of observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who were taken captive weeks ago. Former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma represented Mr. Poroshenko at Monday's meeting, which took place at a rebel-held government building in the Donetsk regional capital. ""I hope that, God willing, we will gradually resolve all the problems,"" he said. The U.S. State Department took note of the separatists' decision but said they were watching for evidence of an actual halt in hostilities. ""There are words out there people have spoken about supporting the cease-fire, but we haven't seen actions taken to back that up yet,"" spokeswoman Marie Harf said. The White House said earlier that President Barack Obama spoke with Mr. Putin on Monday and urged him to cut off aid to separatists and support a peaceful solution to the crisis. ""Though we believe that a diplomatic solution is still possible, Russia will face additional costs if we do not see concrete actions to de-escalate the situation,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Moscow has denied providing military support to the rebels. European leaders are set to discuss a tougher round of sanctions against Russia at a meeting on Friday. Europe, along with the U.S., have said repeatedly they are ready to move if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates. However, there are disagreements within the EU about what should trigger that step and many European governments are reluctant to risk an all-out economic conflict with Moscow. ""There is an opportunity now for everybody in eastern Ukraine if they support the plan put forward by President Poroshenko,"" said U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""And in the absence of that, the European Union will be able to take further measures, further sanctions on Russia. .so we now look to Russia to support the peace plan."" The Donetsk meeting -- which was held in a room decorated with the separatist flag -- was a significant step by both sides. The two sides, however, remain far apart. Mr. Poroshenko for weeks has said he wouldn't negotiate with anyone with ""blood on their hands,"" despite pressure from the Kremlin for the government to engage in unconditional talks. Rebels had previously scoffed at the cease-fire and earlier Monday, Mr. Borodai said rebel forces would put down their weapons only if the government pulled back its forces from the two regions under militant control and recognized them as independent republics. Monday's agreement to a large degree puts the ball back in Kiev's court. Mr. Kuchma, Ukraine's second president after independence in 1991, long sought to balance ties between Russia and the West. But he set the stage for the pro-Western Orange Revolution in 2004 when he tried to engineer the election of Viktor Yanukovych as his successor."

ea0e8221-c788-41d6-a408-8d2656cd7dea,"The starting point of the Sino-Soviet conflict was represented by the 20th Congress of the Soviet Union Communist Party in the period 14-25 February 1956. The impact of the denouncement of the personality cult and the Stalin's public conviction was viewed differently from one country to another, depending on the national characteristics and the political-economic situation. Despite the reluctance towards the decisions that were adopted on the 20th Congress of the SUCP, the Chinese leaders wanted to maintain a close relationship with the Soviet Union, but, at the same time, decided to follow their own way in the edification of the socialism according to the national specific characteristics, represented by the defiance of the Soviet leadership and challenging it to a competition, both political and ideological. Since the 50s, the People's Republic of China, together with the leaders of the European Socialist countries, started to get involved in normal party relationships, regular mutual visits between the governments and institutions, cooperated within the organizations and international conferences, made commercial exchanges that were very significant in the Chinese export trade, there was a significant economic cooperation through industrial partnerships, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation projects, students and sports people exchanges, etc. The Chinese authorities seemed satisfied with these relationships, until the mid-60s, when the Sino-Soviet rupture took place. The difference mainly appeared in the public arguments of the Communist Party of China and the Soviet Union Communist Party about the Marxist-Leninist ideology, affecting the party and state relationships. In this context, the relationships of the Communist Party of China with the European socialist countries were influenced by the positions that the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had following the conflict. Punctul de plecare al conflictului sino-sovietic îl reprezinta Congresul al XX-lea al Partidului Comunist al Uniunii Sovietice din perioada 14-25 februarie 1956. Impactul denuntarii cultului personalitatii si condamnarea în public a lui Stalin, a fost diferit de la o tara la alta, depinzând de caracteristicile nationale si de situatia politico-economica. În ciuda rezervelor fata de deciziile adoptate la Congresul al XX-lea al PCUS, liderii chinezi au dorit sa pastreze o relatie apropiata cu Uniunea Sovietica dar, în acelasi timp, au hotarât sa urmeze un drum propiu de edificare a socialismului în functie de specificul national, caracterizat de sfidarea conducerii sovietice si provocarea acesteia la întrecere, atât în plan politic, cât si ideologic. Republica Populara Chineza împreuna cu liderii tarilor socialiste europene s-au implicat începând cu anii '50 în legaturi de partid normale, vizite reciproce regulate între guverne si institutii, au colaborat în cadrul organizatiilor si conferintelor internationale, au avut schimburi comerciale de o mare însemnatate în comer tul exporturilor Chinei, au existat cooperari economice semnificative prin parteneriate industriale, proiecte de colaborare stiintifica, tehnologica si culturala, schimburi de studenti, sportivi, etc. Autoritatile chineze au parut multumite de aceste relatii, pâna la mijlocul anilor '60, când s-a produs ruptura sino-sovietica. Divergentele s-au manifestat în special în certurile publice ale Partidul Comunist Chinez si Partidul Comunist al Uniunii Sovietice despre ideologia marxist-leninista, afectând relatiile de partid si stat. În acest context, relatiile PCC cu tarile socialiste europene au fost influentate de pozitiile luate de catre Republica Populara Chineza si Uniunea Republicilor Sovietice Socialiste în urma conflictului. 1956, Eastern Europe, communist countries, Soviet Union Communist Party, People's Republic of China, ideology. In the period of 1953-1956, the personality of Joseph V. Stalin in USSR , after his death, began to be left in a shade. Although in the hierarchy and peak of the party there were no significant changes in this period, his image started to vanish from the official evocations and praises, and the references to him in the press of that period became few and far between. Nikita Khrushchev began to take a series of measures, aiming at decentralizing the leadership, the liberalization of the political system and reducing the bureaucratic apparatus. He tried to discuss and revise the objectives and relations inside the international communist movement in an objective way that offered continuity and long life to those relations The international situation after Stalin's death faced a process of resettling, the beginning of an expansion . Despite all this, the contradictions between the ideology and the political reality of the Soviet model already existed Three years after Stalin's death, in the period of 14-25 February 1956, took place the 20th Congress of the SUCP that represented one of the most important moments in the post-Stalinist history of USSR. During the Congress, Nikita Khrushchev presented a ""secret report"" inside the closed meeting on the 25th February 1956, called About the personality cult and its consequences4 in which he excused Stalin of practising the personality cult, of deviating from the Leninist principles of life in the party and power abuse. In brief, Khrushchev's speech was based on the deprecation of Stalin's abuses and persecutions against the party members, taking decisions without the approval of the Central Committee of the Party, his mistakes as military leader, the policy of repression on a large scale against the military personnel5. Khrushchev accused Stalin of megalomania, loss of the sense of reality, suspicion and arrogance not only against the people in the country, but also against parties and entire countries6, but also of the mistakes made in the external policy, especially towards the Eastern countries bloc. In Khrushchev's opinion, Stalin's personality cult spread in a negative way during Stalin's life, he isolated himself from the people and the party, his lack of interest in the important problems and emergencies regarding the party and country's life7 affected the party's construction and the economic activity, leading to the violation of the internal democracy of the party and the Soviet democracy and the instauration of fear inside the party8. All these were considered by Khrushchev to be a negative consequence of Stalin's personality cult and as his exclusive fault, which did not have any relationship with the policy promoted by the communist party, because the main purpose was to criticize Stalin's actions and not the communist party that represented the essential foundation of power in the Soviet system9. And all these things happened while Stalin was alive, under his leadership and with his consent Although the report was meant to be secret, it became public in June 1956, when a Polish journalist sent a copy of the text of the report to the New York Times, to be published The polemics between the People's Republic of China and the USSR started in 1956, within the 20th Congress of the SUCP, where the reevaluation of the personality of Joseph V. Stalin was accepted with reluctance by the representatives of the European socialist countries, especially by the Communist Party of China The speech was approached reluctantly by the representatives of the communist states in the Congress. In a series of countries, such as Poland or The German Democratic Republic after the 20th Congress, the newspapers started a hard criticism on the Stalin's personality cult In the USSR, the speech held by N. Khrushchev managed to separate the Soviet society in partisans and enemies. It was an important moment in the defrost policy promoted by Khrushchev;13 the exposure of Stalin's personality cult confirmed his leading role in ruling the party and the state. Khrushchev's speech had different effects inside the states from the communist bloc. It was going to be received with reluctance by the leaders of the European communist countries and some of the communist parties started to question the Soviet policy. The reactions of the European socialist parties' leaders were not long in coming. They started, on the one hand to attack and criticize those deviating from the ideological line of the parties, on the other hand, started a rehabilitation policy of those unfairly considered - class enemies The most obvious change in Khrushchev's official speech was that regarding the international relations. The main idea launched in the 20th Congress of USSR was that of peaceful cohabitation. Nikita Khrushchev launched the calling to a peaceful competition between the two systems, being convinced of the communist system victory over the capitalist one. Thus, the Leninist thesis about developing peaceful relations between states with different political systems was given currency. ""The Great Lenin proclaimed and substantiated the possibility of a peaceful cohabitation between states with different social-political systems. In its external policies, the Soviet state relentlessly went by this Leninist principle. If for some of the communist states bloc, the policy supported by Moscow caused instability and led to crises in the leadership, other states took advantage of the decision of the Soviet Union leader in order to adopt ""the new way"". The Soviet Union played an important role in the relationship between the People's Republic of China and the European socialist countries in the 50s. After Stalin's death, the People's Republic of China started to develop bilateral relationships with the European socialist parties, through official visits. During Stalin's period, the relations were mainly nominal, after his death, the development of the relations started. In the People's Republic of China, Khrushchev's speech and attitude were characterized by the leader Mao Zedong as being the first step on the way of the revisionism, adopted by the leadership of SUCP.The leader of the CPC felt vexed that he wasn't treated with respect and the Soviets did not consult with the brotherly parties in advance In GDR, Walter Ulbrich stated that Stalin was not a classicIn Hungary, the party pleaded László Rajk19 not guilty and in Poland - in the party, but also in the intelligentsia, different voices raised that requested more thorough reforms of the Stalinist system. The public conviction of Stalin's policies by Nikita Khrushchev, whose measures Mao Zedong easily identified with, was in obvious opposition with Mao's internal struggle against the reformist wing of CPC. This one was afraid that his policy was illegitimate, that is why he became hostile to the official line of the USSR. Also, being a radical, he didn't agree with USSR's attempts to normalize the relationships with the USA, the communism land and the capitalism land not being able to cohabitate, in Mao's opinion. However, his main fear was that the superpowers could get to an agreement in the detriment of China From the President Mao Zedong's point of view, ""Stalin, was mainly fair, he played a positive role, but also made mistakes"" that ""were explained by the peculiarities of conditions in the internal development of the Soviet Union."" In Mao's opinion, mistakes had been made and would be made in the future by the political parties, it was important to ""take measures, to prevent them and when such mistakes were made, to eliminate them. No country's experience is available for another country. The experience must be taken as referential, as documentary material, of reference. Mao Zedong was afraid that Khrushchev's speech was going to cause confusion and doubt, even perturbation inside the Communist Party of China, as it had already happened in some European socialist countries. In the editorial article from ""Renmin Ribao"", on the 5th April 1956, named About the historical experience of the proletariat dictatorship, the CPC showed that an essential thing is correcting the mistakes and not allowing to repeat and extend them,22 as a consequence to the wave of confusion and torment caused by Khrushchev's speech in some European socialist countries. Mao Zedong approached the criticism against Stalin as an attack to the theoretical and practical bases of building the socialism, where a central role was played by the proletariat dictatorship. In addition, the Chinese communist leaders were dissatisfied by the fact that by disclosing Stalin's mistakes ""it was offered the possibility to the reactionaries in the whole world to gladly debate the self-criticism of the SUCP"" and thus had the opportunity to discredit the Soviet Union and the other communist parties Because of this, the PRC adopted a very prudent attitude towards the European socialist countries; the main policy of the CPC was one of treating separately and of trying to adopt a varied position towards every separate country, because every separate European socialist country had a different attitude towards the disagreements, then towards the split in the Sino-Soviet relations. There were several types of relations between PRC and the European socialist countries. Mention must be made that these relations were subordinated to the Sino-Soviet relations, the main attitude of the People's Republic of China in the relation with the European socialist countries being determined by the Soviet factor. A first type of relationship was the Sino-Albanian one. When the USSR participated in a repression of a Hungarian revolution in the autumn of 1956, Tirana and the Beijing supported Moscow's action. The leaders of the Party of Labour of Albania virulently attacked the line and decisions of the 20th Congress and openly and strongly denunciated the personality cult and its negative effects. Albania had its recognition by the P.R. of China as a socialist country and was awarded substantial grants and loans to support the development of the Albanian society. When the PRC opposed the Soviet revisionism, the Sino-Albanian relationships were close until 1970, when Albania accused the PRC of revisionism after improving the Sino-American relationships and this thing led to the degradation of the Sino-Albanian relationships. The Sino-Yugoslavian relationships were marked by a different evolution, that at the beginning were characterized by arguments, then they improved. Yugoslavia represented a unique situation. At the beginning of the relationships with the PRC it opposed the Yugoslavian revisionism, so that later, in the 70s, China and Yugoslavia normalized their relationships, the mutual reason being that of opposing the policy of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, regarding the relationships between Yugoslavia and the USSR, although Josip Broz Tito, the president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia advocated that he supported the new series of measures and political perspectives of the Soviet government after the 20th Congress of the SUCP, for managing the existing international tensions. This thing did not happen anymore because the actions and the policy after the Congress of the USSR were actually opposed to the allegations The relationships between the PRC and the Romanian People's Republic was rather linear, it did not face extreme ups and downs. The diplomatic relationships started after the proclamation of the People's Republic of China on October 5th 1949, the RPR being the third country that recognized the PRC. Romania maintained a neuter position regarding the Sino-Soviet disagreement, the Romanian Communist Party avoided involving in the theoretical arguments, debates or confrontations of the PRC and for a while, the RPR played the role of mediator between the PRC and the USSR. The relationships between the PRC and Poland, GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria developed on another pattern. We cannot place the relationship with each country on the same line, but all these five countries had something in common in the mid-50s, that is, going through a process of familiarization and normalization of their relationships with the P.R. of China. Since the mid-50s, the PRC adopted a series of new relations towards the European socialist countries. In the middle of the PRC's external policies was the theory, according to which, the inter-state relationships must be based on the five principles of peaceful cohabitation, especially after the events in Poland and the incidents in Hungary of the autumn of the year 1956, taking the decision that these principles had to apply according to the relationships between the socialist countries. This position was expressed for the first time in the declaration of the Chinese government of the 1st November 1956, as an answer to the Soviet declaration on the 1st October 1956. It was the first time that these principles were included in an official document and it was used in order to guide the relationships between the socialist countries. After the 20th Congress of the SUCP the governments of the political parties in Poland, GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria associated at different levels with the Soviet Union in the criticism against the CPC as well as in adopting negative attitudes towards the People's Republic of China. Although, after the Plenum of the Central Committee of the SUCP in October 1964, when the position of leader of Nikita S. Khrushchev from the SUCP was occupied by Leonid Brezhnev, and the criticism of these countries regarding the PRC was diminished, still, the relationships between PRC and these countries will be affected by the end of the 1980s. Nevertheless, all these countries had remarkable contributions to re-establishing the legitimate rights of the PRC within the United Nations Organization and other international organizations. We may remark that since the 1980s, the relationships between Poland, GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria on the one hand and the PRC on the other hand, could be considered normal relationships between nations that were not motivated by doctrinal considerations or own national material interests. In October 1956, during the Polish incidents, the PRC supported Poland and opposed the Soviet military intervention, the main reason of the support and the Chinese attitude was of opposing the SUCP that assumed its role of patriarchal party and had intervened in the internal affairs of another country from the communist bloc. Mao Zedong had expressed his point of view before, stating that the relationships between the brotherly countries should be equal and the USSR should not assume the role of father, while the other socialist countries had to assume the role of son. At the beginning of the development of events in Poland, Wladyslaw Gomulka, who, in 1948, was denounced as a right-wing nationalist leader, was criticized, removed from his position and sent to prison, then he became the first secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party. He wanted Poland to take its own way in building the communism. His return to the leadership meant a reversal of the verdict regarding the right wing nationalism in 1948 which he was accused of. This thing agitated the leaders of the Soviet Union that did not tolerate changes without a personal approval and Khrushchev did not approve of the appointment of Gomulka as first secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish People's Republic. In Beijing, Mao Zedong expressed his disapproval towards Khrushchev's attempt of intervening in a military way in Poland, being against the Soviet policy and this thing had an important echo in the relationships between the PRC and Poland. In the press release given by the Government of the People's Republic of China in November 1956, regarding the relationships between the European socialist countries, the People's Republic of China showed that the relationships between socialist countries are not exempted from errors and these errors, in time, led to ruptures and distance between the European socialist countries and with time, these ruptures led to a tense situation that wouldn't have been created otherwise, an example being the events in Poland While the events in Poland from the autumn of 1956 were overcome without bloodshed,26 the revolution in Budapest represented one of the most violent episodes in the post-war history of the countries in the Soviet BlocThe Central Committee of the CPC had a different view of it and changed its attitude towards the events in Hungary. During the first days, the event in Hungary was not considered a revolution by the Chinese leaders; from their point of view, the manifestations in Hungary were influenced by those in Poland. On October 23rd there were hundreds of thousands of people who manifested on the streets. At the beginning the demonstrations were peaceful and the people only expressed their discontentment towards the party policy and the personality cult of Mátyás Rákosi. But later, after the situation got out of hand on the 24th and the 25th and some members of the communist party and of the security forces were killed, the nature of the event changed. Those days, the vice-president of the PRC, Liu Shaiqi went to the Soviet Union and discussed this matter with the Soviet leadership. Although from the point of view of the P.R of China the events in Poland were caused by the unfair Soviet attitude towards a brotherly party, at those moments, for the Chinese leaders, the nature of the events in Hungary was changing. In this context, Khrushchev reminded that, during the critical moments in Poland and Hungary, he was to consult with his brotherly Communist Party of China After the meeting between the Chinese coomission led by Liu Shaoqi and Khrushchev, the Soviets decided to send troops to Hungary in order to stop the rebellion, a decision that was supported by the Chinese government. The Hungarian revolution may be defined as a political revolution, the effects of the events from the entire year 1956 in the context of the international communist policy being decisive for the Chinese communist leadership in the relationships with the European socialist countries. After the degradation of the relationships between the PRC and USSR in the 1960s, regarding the relationships with the European socialist countries, the Beijing authorities used the policy of the contradictions between the countries in the Soviet bloc and USSR to alienate from the Soviet policy. At the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, the relationships between the People's Republic of China and the European socialist countries started to normalize. Many factors contributed to this evolution. It was the result of an adjustment in both the Chinese external policy and Soviet external policy, that changed the course of the Sino-Soviet relationships and this thing led to the change in the relationships between the USSR and the European socialist countries. There were different points of view regarding the starting point and the causes that led to the rupture between the PRC and USSR. From the PRC point of view, the main fundamental reason of the rupture was the Soviet chauvinism. The Soviet Union assumed a patriarchal position towards the socialist countries and wanted to control everything. The Soviet Union put pressure on the countries that did not want to obey its orders and even used military force to intervene in other countries' internal affairs. The Sino-Soviet disagreement started in 1921, since then, the Communist Party of China came into being. Then, in 1956, after the 20th Congress of SUCP, the ideological differences between the two countries led to the exacerbation of the conflict. The most serious consequences on the PRC were represented by the renouncement of the Soviets to the agreement regarding the cooperation in the field of nuclear weapons and withdrawing the Soviet experts from China. The dialogue could not resolve the different points of view of the two countries, the Soviets wanted that PRC obey their strategy and did not tolerate any different point of view and, on the other hand, the CPC completely rejected the external Soviet policy. The relationships of the communist China with the European socialist countries started to change along with the changes taking place on international level, especially the changes that occurred in the Sino-Soviet relationship. Compared to the Sino-Soviet relationship, within the relationships of the PRC with the European socialist countries there was no major conflict of interests. Since the mid-50s, the European socialist countries, excepting Yugoslavia, took advantage of the ""new course"" and left the ideological differences behind the economic, commercial, cultural and scientific exchanges with the PRC. No matter if it was a limited opening or a more thorough opening, such as the case of Poland or Hungary, the air of the liberalization was felt in the entire bloc The year 1956 represented an important point in the history of the world communism. The Sino-Soviet rupture was a long-term historical process that went beyond the conventions and the dogmatic and ideological limits. In this context, the relationships between the People's Republic of China with the European socialist countries were motivated mainly by the different position and attitude, adopted by every European socialist country, towards the PRC and the Soviet Union. Because the political restlessness after the 20th Congress of the SUCP in February 1956 affected almost all the socialist world, the PRC followed its own policy towards the European socialist countries. At the same time, the European socialist countries tried to have closer relationships than those they had with the People' Republic of China before, , in order to limit the Soviet influenceNevertheless, the internal radicalization in China led to a rupture in the relationships with Yugoslavia in 1957-1958 and subsequently led to a distance in the relationships with all the other Eastern-European countries, excepting Albania, after 1958 Because every European socialist country adopted a different attitude towards the Sino-Soviet differences, the PRC thought out differently the policies towards each country separately. The People's Republic of China did not want the ideological differences that they had with the USSR, starting with the mid-50s, to affect the inter-state relationships, that is why they had a different approach to the relationships with the European socialist countries. This may be the reason why there was no fundamental conflict of interests between the PRC and the European socialist countries, the foundation of the relationships between the PRC and the European socialist countries being the relationship between the CPC and USSR."
10bc37b0-af90-4408-b829-3182bfabcb82,"Undeniably, the post-Soviet space in the recent years has become the staging ground for ambitious power play for establishing regional supremacy and global hegemony between Moscow and Washington. Russia, while determined to reestablish Kremlin's great power status by reasserting its regional hegemony by keeping out the US behind the redline, Washington endeavors to establish its global supremacy by containing Russia in its own backyard through its own networks. After Georgia in 2008, the recent victim of this geopolitical engagement between Moscow and Washington is Ukraine. The intensive worldwide discussion and debate over Ukraine crisis over the last several months speaks about the aggravation of position between Russia and the west, particularly the US, in the geopolitical space of Kiev. Yet, the taproot of the Ukraine crisis goes far beyond Kiev and Crimea. The NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe; staging of movements like Orange, Tulip and Color revolutions; construction of alternative gas pipeline to undermine Russian monopoly over the control and administration of gas lines; and resurgent Russia under Putin's leadership with an intent to reinstate Russian hegemony in and around the post-Soviet space for all practical purposes have been the central elements of discord between Russia and the west where Ukraine plays just a role of catalyst. Against this background, this paper makes a modest attempt to understand Ukraine crisis from a geopolitical perspective. It endeavors to analyze the nature of reengagement of Russia and the US in the geostrategic belt of former Soviet Union. The study looks into the Russian strategies to reassert its influence in the near abroad. Besides, the US policy towards the former republics of the Soviet Union in order to ease the Russian overpresence in the region is also studied minutely. Finally, the paper proposes how Ukraine is not a victim and instead a catalyst in the game played out in eastern Europe and warns about the far-reaching consequences it will have for the regional order. Introduction Since the end of the Cold War, for the second time, unilateral America and the resurgent Russian unresolved contradictions are out in the open, that too in the former Soviet space. The post-Soviet space in the recent years has become the staging ground for ambitious power play for establishing regional supremacy and global hegemony between Moscow and Washington. While Russia is determined to reestablish Kremlin's great power status by reasserting its regional hegemony by keeping out the US behind the redline, Washington endeavors to establish its global supremacy by containing Russia in its own backyard by creating its own network of eastward expansion of NATO in east Europe; construction of BTC pipeline-an alternate pipeline to undermine the Russian monopoly over the pipeline routes-and creation of regional disorder by supporting and sustaining Color, Tulip and Orange revolutions in the post-Soviet space to challenge the Russian hold over the strategic region. Determined to keep the US out of the Russian geopolitical orbit, Kremlin has been actively reasserting itself in the post-Soviet space, particularly after Putin's emergence to power in Moscow. However, right after the disintegration of the great Soviet Union, Russia wanted to have a united alliance with all the former Soviet Republics through the elaborate structure of the Commonwealth of Independent States, then through Collective Security Treaty Organization , later by use of energy as an instrument of political pressure, and to some extent by Shanghai Cooperation Organization , and even by military means like the 2008 Russo-Georgian war and the recent Ukraine crisis. Among all the above-mentioned initiatives taken by Russia to keep intact its influence in the post-Soviet space, the last two events that happened in Georgia and Ukraine created ripples in the world politics and led to aggressive engagement between Russia and West, especially between Russia and the US. Against this background, the paper makes a modest attempt to analyze the Russo-American relations in the light of the recent Ukraine crisis. The study looks into the Russian strategies to reassert its influence in the near abroad. Besides, the US policy towards the former republics of the Soviet Union in order to ease the Russian overpresence in the region is also studied minutely. The paper follows Ukraine's turbulent history since independence to the Orange Revolution and investigates the underlying causes of the ""frozen conflicts"" of Crimea and Ukraine. Since the Ukraine crisis is geopolitically conditioned by great power engagement in the geostrategic space of Kiev for asserting Russian supremacy and American hegemony, the crisis is seen in such light. The paper tries to understand the present state of affairs in Ukraine. The Slavic state betting for high stakes and risks for vacillating between west and east has been challenged by multifarious historic, ethnic and geopolitical factors responsible for the current state of complexity and unpredictability in the post-Soviet space. Further, the paper also adds an Indian dimension for its relevance to the Indian readers as to the implications of Ukraine crisis for India, particularly to the defense sector. The Ukraine Crisis Ukraine-an East European country with an estimated area of 603,628 sq. km- is in fact the largest country in the entire EuropeGeopolitically, Ukraine holds greater importance both for Russia and the west as the former Soviet republic borders Russia in the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to the west, Romania and Moldova to the southwest, and Black Sea and Sea of Arov to the south and southeast, respectivelyA massive country with 45 million population, Ukraine has struggled with its identity crisis since it gained independence with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, the country's most prolonged and deadly crisis since independence started on November 21, 20133 following protests and demonstrations against the Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych's decision to drop the plans to forge close trade ties with European Union , paving the way for the country's integration with the EU, which has since spurred a global standoffbetween Russia and the Western powers headed by the US. The root of the crisis can be traced back to the days soon after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Ukraine has been vacillating between Russia and EU over the years. This is so because, Ukraine is an economically devastated state now. Thinking that its association with EU and Russia will provide comfort and lease of life to its dying economy and gas to its energy-ravenous population and projects, Kiev has developed its relations with EU to ensure help in reducing trade deficit and stayed well in the geopolitical orbit of Russia to ensure the much-needed security from the Kremlin front along with lucrative gas and energy packages. But to the dismay of Ukraine, the economic package offered by the EU, if accepted, would have a disastrous effect on the Ukrainian economy. Hence, the incumbent President of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovych, after due deliberation, decided not to sign the associated membership treaty with EU and instead chose to remain the strategic partner of Russia, for which Moscow had promised to provide Ukraine with $15- bn worth of credit and supply of gas with 60% discount that would certainly help revive the ailing economy of the trouble-torn countryThis decision of Yanukovych did not go down well with the western quarters, which had since then been orchestrating a campaign to take away Ukraine from the geopolitical orbit of Russia, and started conspiring against Yanukovych for ousting him from the top post. Thus, a good guy in the eyes of the west for years turned into a bad one overnight. He was dubbed a dictator, authoritarian and enemy of real Ukrainians. On top of it all, the Yanukovych government, charged with bankruptcy and corruption, was facing massive protests and demonstrations domestically with hundreds and thousands out on the streets. Seizing this opportune moment, the Radical Opposition Party of Ukraine staged a protest in the streets of Kiev with the active financial and strategic support of the western powers. According to the account of the Russian media, even the protesters were trained and were provided with logistic support in the embassies of the western powers in KievWhen the protest went out of control and became violent, President Yanukovych ordered the state militia to fire against the protesters. As many protesters died in the mass protest, there was popular outrage against the Yanukovych government. With the support of the west and some officials in Kiev, the protesters with their fascist agenda captured the government buildings and offices. Finally, the protests, with material, money and logistic support from the west turned into a coup d'état, forcing President Yanukovych to flee the capital. Nevertheless, in exile, Yanukovych declared himself as the legitimate President of Ukraine and refused to resign. The fascist forces, with the tacit help of some opposition leaders, have appointed the Speaker of the Supreme Rada, Olexander Torchinov, as the acting President. The new President, after assuming office, has been behaving like a stooge of the west. He has taken several anti-Russian measures, reversing all the agreements signed by the previous President with Moscow and canceled the status of Russian language as the second official language in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian majority provinces of Ukraine, i.e., Crimea and the south and eastern Ukraine, have declared themselves as autonomous provinces and refused to recognize the new authority at Kiev. Accelerating the crisis further, Crimea declared its independence and passed a resolution through a referendum to break away from Ukraine and integrate with Russian Federation by all means. This has resulted in a standoffbetween the two Slavic states, further fueled by the intervention of Europe and the US. Since Ukraine holds strategic significance for Russia, both in terms of security and geopolitics, any move of Ukraine away from the Russian Orbit towards the European and western powers amounts to a threat to the geopolitical interests of Russia. Knowing all this well, Russia protested the move of the new government at Kiev and refused to recognize it as legitimate. With this standoffbetween Russia and Ukraine, the pro-Russian supporters of Ukraine have protested against the new authority and declared it as illegitimate. The new government in retaliation used forces against the ethnic Russians in Crimea and Ukraine. In order to protect the Russians in Ukraine, the Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the new authority in Kiev not to proceed with its misadventures and also conveyed that war, as a last resort, could be declared. When the Radical Nationalist Army captured certain government offices in Ukraine and Crimea, the Ukrainian new authority complained that Russia has attacked Crimea and taken it under its control. Therefore, the US along with the European powers executed a plan and warned Russia of severe consequences if it went ahead with its aggression against Ukraine. Russia, ignoring the economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the western powers, declared that Russia has the right to protect its national interests if the need arose and could also use war as the last resort. Ukraine, at this juncture, is having serious problems with its decision to side with the west at the cost of east as the Crimea autonomous province, through a referendum, has declared its intention to secede from Ukraine and passed a resolution in its Parliament to merge with the Russian Federation with the consent of Moscow. However, recognizing the territorial integrity of Ukraine, Putin is ready to give another chance to Kiev to reconsider its decision to join EU. Amidst all these problems, Ukraine went for a tense Presidential Election on May 25, 2014The US backed and supported billionaire Petro Poroshenko to win the recently held election in the civil war-torn and deeply divided country on nationality lines. Yet he declares himself to be the President of Ukraine, despite Russian objection to his election and non-participation of Ukrainian Russians in the voting process. As the new leader's pro-American intention is beyond doubt, it would be interesting to see the future course that Ukraine takes, with a resurgent and energetic Russia out on a war path against the west on the issue of Crimea. East Europe as It Stands Today East Europe in recent times has been turned into a war zone. The aggressive and incessant confrontation between the pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian radicals have created civic unrest in the region leading to human casualities of more than 2,600 and several thousands injured so far. In spite of all this, the standoff between Russia and the west in Ukraine does not seem to be dying down, instead it is worsening day by day. Ukraine has determined to create another 60,0007 strong national guards to defend the country in its eastern border, while the NATO has already sanctioned a strong force of 4,0008 to support the Ukrainian soldiers against the pro-Russian rebels, claimed to be actively supported logistically and militarily by Kremlin. The recent act of Russia expelling the Polish ambassador to Russia and open snubbing of Putin by the west in the G-20 Summit held in Brisbane in November 2014, signals the danger of the engagement in the Eurasian landscape. MH17 Shot Down Over Eastern Ukraine By far the most tragic incident of Ukraine crisis is the shooting down of Malaysian airline MH17 over eastern Ukraine killing all 298 people on boardIt has created a diplomatic ripple in Europe and beyond, as the west has claimed Russian hand in the shooting down of the civilian plane. In this regard, Ukraine Intelligence has gone further in blaming Russia entirely for the incident and claimed that the plane was hit by the rebels using a BUK surface-to-air launcher, a Russian-made weapon. However, Kremlin strongly denied the charge and requested for an impartial international investigation into the incident. Ukraine is central to Russian identity and origin. Kiev has been the capital city of Kievan Rus-the first Slavic state of east dating back to 9th century ADA country that has been a part of the great Soviet empire for centuries, closely aligned, and sharing superb bonding, and splendid socio-cultural affinities over the years, cannot be suddenly foreign to Moscow. The neighbors, though separated from each other through the Malta Accord in December 8, 1991, never became so indifferent to each other until now. Geostrategically, Ukraine constitutes a natural border for Russia in the west, making it very important for its security and territorial integrity along with regional peace. At a time when NATO is freely attracting countries of eastern Europe using the lure of defense, economic and trade packages along with security guarantees, Ukraine's moving away from Russia's geopolitical orbit is completely unacceptable to Moscow. Because, Kiev's integration with the EU will leave the security of Russia in the western border wide open and will pose serious challenges to Moscow from the NATO for years to come. Hence, the recent effort of EU to invite east European members to join the organization using the lure of best economic packages and a western model of governance has attracted countries like Ukraine and at the same time alarmed Russia of its weakening hold over the regional order. The EU's Eastern Partnership Program, established in 2009, is aimed at forging tighter bonds with six former Eastern bloc countries. Russia sees it as a stepping stone to organizations such as NATO, whose eastward expansion is regarded by Russia's security establishment as a threat. Ukraine belongs to NATO's Partnership for Peace program but is seen as having little prospect of joining the alliance in the foreseeable future. Similar concerns about Georgia contributed to Moscow 's deployment of forces at the Georgian border in 2008, which led to a brief war and Russian occupation of the breakaway regions, South Ossetia and AbkhaziaMilitarily also Ukraine is important to Russia as Kremlin's Black Sea fleets are based in Crimea under a bilateral agreement. Ukraine is also a buffer between Russia and the west in Europe. Economically, Ukraine is a valued partner of Russia. Moscow 's emphasis on Kiev on economic terms can be understood from the Eurasian Union vision of Kremlin due for 2015 that includes Ukraine along with Kazakhstan, Belarus and ArmeniaUkraine plays an important role in Russia's energy trade; its pipelines provide transit to 80% of the natural gas Russia sends to European markets, and Ukraine itself is a major market for Russian gas Ukraine obviously is the redline for Russia without which Russia can never retrieve its global great power status. The west, well-aware of this fact, is hell-bent upon tearing Ukraine away from the Russian geopolitical orbit and bringing it into the NATO fold. The west tried once in 2005 to instigate 'colored revolution 'to prevent Victor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian political leader, to assume power even after he was elected as the President in a fiercely-fought electionThe west succeeded in managing Victor Yuschenko, the new President of Ukraine, by use of street force. The pro-American leader did everything possible to make his country a NATO member and launched dubious initiatives like GUUAM to inflict damage on vital Russian interests in every sphere. Yuschenko was arming and providing all support to Georgian President Mikhail Shakashvili during the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. However, Yushchenko lost the presidential election held in 2010 to his rival Yanukovych and polled hardly 4% of the votesBut what Russia does not want in her neighborhood is another Georgia in the form of Ukraine. That is the main reason why Russia looks worried as its security will be vulnerable due to the presence of west in Ukraine. Nevertheless, this time around, unlike the Russo-Georgian crisis of 2008, power equation is slightly in favor of Kremlin. While Russia is resurging in global power status ladder by meaningful use of its strategic energy reserves, the US is a declining world power because of its war mongering attitude all around the globe. In a situation like this, Putin cannot let down Moscow by allowing the ill-design of the west to prevail in its neighborhood. More so, the national interest of Russia lies in Ukraine's closeness to Kremlin and dissociation from EU and the US. Therefore, it is indisputable on the part of Russia to make every attempt not to allow Ukraine to move away from the Russian geopolitical orbit as it will undermine Russian power position in global politics and reduce Moscow to merely a regional player. On top of it all, Russia's attachment to Ukraine is beyond political and economic considerations, it is more psychological and cultural, as Moscow regards Kiev to be the heart and soul of the Slavic states. Hence, any integration treaty of Ukraine with EU will take Kiev away from the Russian orbit. In addition, Ukraine has massive percentage of Russian ethnic population whose security is the responsibility of Putin's regime. Therefore, Putin reasserted the security and protection of Russians abroad as the topmost priority of Moscow come what may. This strong resolution of Vladimir Putin has not gone down well with certain western quarters and particularly with the Obama administration which further has led to heightened tension in the region. Role of the US and EU in the Ukraine Crisis Europe and the US are at the center of the Ukraine crisis. It is the EU's Eastern Partnership Program established in 2009 to expand political and economic ties between the EU and other east European countries that were not original members of EU that has led to irreparable damage to Ukraine's very existence and survivalThe association agreement negotiated by EU officials with Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych in November 2013, involving a deep and comprehensive free trade deal has not gone down well with KremlinPressure from Moscow, along with a lucrative deal of huge economic package for Ukrainian economy, compelled Victor Yanukovych to back out from the EU agreement citing that the EU package would be too heavy for the Ukrainian economy to bear, leading to lots of resentment both within and outside Ukraine, accusing Yanukovych of acting against Kiev's interests. West, already having serious problems with Russia since the Georgian crisis, wanted to have another kind of revolution in Ukraine to throw out Yanukovych from power. The western powers with the help of Radical Opposition Party of Ukraine stage-managed protests and demonstrations against the Yanukovych government citing massive bankruptcy, corruption and maladministration as reasons. It is true that Yanukovych government was facing massive corruption and other charges, but to topple him with active strategic and financial help and logistic support offered by the western powers in their embassies located in Kiev is nothing but interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine by the west. What Is the Status of Crimea? Before the famous referendum to break away from Kiev, Crimea was an autonomous province of Ukraine with 2 million people and with its own Parliament to make law. It is also a majority Russian-inhabited province of Ukraine. Interestingly, Crimea, an integral part of Russia until 1954, was gifted away to Ukraine in commemoration of 300 years of Ukraine's integration with Soviet Union by Nikita Khrushchev, the Ukrainian-born Soviet PresidentHence, Crimea though remained as a geographical part of Ukraine was always under Russian control. Crimea is also the Black Sea naval base headquarters of Russian Federation, hence very important for Russia from a strategic standpoint. After the ouster of Yanukovych in February 2014 and declaration of a new government headed by the Speaker of Ukrainian Parliament, Kiev has adopted a very tough stand against Moscow and signed the treaty of accession to EU. Making its anti-Russian stand very clear, the administration at Kiev tried to deal with the proRussian protesters with a heavy hand, which led to a crisis in Crimea as well. Crimea's parliament called for the March 16, 2014 referendum and the peninsula's 1million voters opted overwhelmingly for union with RussiaThe Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, a city with a special status in the Crimean Peninsula, where most residents are Russians, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian authorities brought to power by the coup. Crimea and Sevastopol adopted declarations of independence on March 11. They held a referendum on March 16, in which 96% of Crimeans and 95% of Sevastopol voters chose to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the reunification deals on March 18 Following that vote, Russian legislators passed a resolution nullifying Ukrainian laws in Crimea and putting in force Russian legislation. The parliament set a deadline of January 1, 2015 for the integration of Crimea's economic, financial, credit, and legal systems into the Russian Federation. It said matters related to military service in Crimea and Sevastopol will be settled by then as well Russia-America Confrontations Over Ukraine Russo-American standoff on the issue has further aggravated the Ukraine crisis with never-ending solutions, as words were exchanged between both the capitals. The US intervention in the crisis and unwarranted interests of EU have led the Russian authorities to take a hardened stand against Ukraine since its independence. The US President Barak Obama refused to attend the G-8 Summit scheduled to be held originally at Sochi in Russia and changed the venue to Hague for the summit on March 25, 201422 with the purpose of isolating Moscow and to send a strong message to Kremlin that any design to annex Crimea will be met with severe challenges from the western front. The west has also warned of political isolation and ""significant consequences"" for Moscow's actions in Ukraine. As expected, there was a sharp reaction from Russia, and the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, had contended that all economic and financial issues are being discussed at the G-20 meetings and not at the G-8. Russia's position was further bolstered by the strong reactions by leaders of the BRICS on March 25, 2014 insisting that no single member can unilaterally determine this issueBut at the same time there was a speculation that Russia could be excluded from the G-20 meeting to be held on November 26, 2014 as indicated by the Australian Foreign Minister The confrontation between Moscow and Washington worsened further with US' imposition of visa sanctions on 30 senior Russian officials and seizing of their properties, including Gennady Timchenko, Putin's chief of staff, and close associate, Sergei Ivanov, Vladimir Yakunin, the influential head of Russian Railways and wealthy businessmen in Putin's ""inner circle"", including Yuri Kovalchuk, the head of Bank Rossiya, which is called ""the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation"" having close ties to Russia's leadership. The list also includes Putin's advisers Sergei Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov, Federation Council Chairwoman Valentina Matviyenko, and Sergei Naryshkin, of the State Duma In reaction to the US visa restrictions, Russian Foreign Ministry banned nine US lawmakers and officials from traveling to Russia. Not lagging behind, Putin's political advisor Vladislav Surkov has also ridiculed the US visa ban imposition and in response said that neither they have any assets in America nor any interests to visit that countryWith the exchange of words at official and diplomatic levels, imposition and counter-imposition of restrictions against each other have further exacerbated the already fueled tension between the two arch rivals. With the Russian military seen moving in Crimea, Obama pointedly warned Russia of harsher actions, which led to further strain in the relations between the Cold War rivals. While EU took active interest in the matter and wanted to engage Moscow through dialog, the terms dictated by the US did not bear any fruit. Despite Russia's repeated statements that the Crimean referendum on secession was in line with the international law and the UN Charter and in conformity with the precedent set by Kosovo's secession from Serbia in 2008, the west and Kiev have refused to recognize the legality of Crimea's reunification with Russia Some Russian and Crimean officials and companies have been subjected to sanctions by western nations, including visa bans and asset freezes after Crimea's incorporation by Russia. In its sharp reaction, Moscow has dismissed all threats of penalties and economic sanctions and asserted that punitive measures will have a boomerang effect on western countries. While the EU has a three-stage plan for sanction on Russia-largely symbolic halting of negotiations with Russia, visa ban and freezing of assets and legal sanctions-the American aggression and irresponsible diplomatic activities have all further deteriorated the environment. Economic Sanctions Against Russia Apart from political and diplomatic isolation, Russia was slapped with severe economic sanctions by the western powers led by the US. Barak Obama issued a stern warning of imposing pointed economic sanctions if Russia continued to proceed on its mission in Ukraine. Possible economic sanctions as contended by the US are: * To impose multilateral sanctions on FDI in Russia that will have direct implications for Russian economic slowdown. * European banks' refusal of short-term debts to Russian private and public sector enterprises which account for over $650 bn at present * To impose sanctions on Russian foreign trade, affecting Russian economy. * Sanctions on Russia's energy trade and excluding it from world trade. * To freeze the accounts of Russian millionaires leaving abroad, thus putting pressure on Russia to mend its ways. China's Gain in Russia-Ukraine Crisis So far China has trod a fine line in the Ukraine crisis in an effort not to take sides. China abstained from a vote on a United Nations Security Council draft resolution that condemned the referendum in Ukraine's Crimea in March 2014 that paved the way for Russia to annex the Black Sea peninsular region. However, Chinese officials have not publicly recognized Crimea as part of RussiaChina is emerging as the winner in the Ukraine crisis even as Russia's relations with the US and the EU go from bad to worse. It has secured a huge gas deal with Gazprom and is making strides towards greater involvement in the Russian oil and gas production. After holding out for better terms for most of a decade, Gazprom finally signed a 30-year contract with China in May that is unofficially valued at $400 bn, locking the two countries into a long-term gas partnership, which should help ease Russian dependence on European gas marketsAt the same time, China has maintained very good working relations with all the countries that are not good with Russia in recent times. The Chinese stand remained same till date as the west is the aggressor in Ukraine creating, funding and fanning Color revolution. Nevertheless, China has benefited most from the crisis, having secured several lucrative oil and gas deals from Russian side, while maintaining good relations with the west. Indian Concerns Although India has nothing to do with Ukraine crisis, it will have to suffer a lot if the crisis persists. A good friend of New Delhi, Ukraine, since Soviet days, shares close diplomatic ties, warm and friendly relationship, superb bonding and sociocultural affinities with India over the years. Apart from being a good ally in international politics, Ukraine also has been a strong trading partner of India in several sectors. The trade relations between these two countries are based upon the longstanding relations they have shared over the years. In 1992, India and Ukraine's trade turnover was at around $138mnOver the years, the trade relations between both the countries took an upward turn and reached a robust $3,103bn in 2013India's exports during this period were $519mn and imports were $2,584mn . The FDI from Ukraine to India was $1mn as on February 2013 Pharmaceuticals account for a majority of the Indian exports to Ukraine . A number of Indian companies like Ranbaxy, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Sun Group, etc. have their representative offices in Ukraine. Representatives of major pharmaceutical companies have set up an Indian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association in Ukraine. The trade figures for the last five years are as follows: The meetings of Joint Working Groups, e.g., on Fertilizers ; Trade and Economic Cooperation ; Tourism ; Pharmaceutical ; and S&T were held in April 2013 in New Delhi More than 17 bilateral agreements have been signed between India and Ukraine, including agreements on Cooperation in Science and Technology, Foreign Office Consultation, Cooperation in Space Research, Avoidance of Double Taxation and Promotion and Protection of Investments. In the economic field, bilateral cooperation continued to strengthen with nearly 20 Indian companies from the Federation of Indian Export Organizations participating in the Ambiente Ukraine-a plastics exhibition in Kiev during October 9-12, 2013 in Kiev. This was followed by a 17-member Indian business delegation under ASSOCHAM which took part in the INTERAGRO FAIR in Kiev during October 30-31, 2013 But important among all is Ukraine's trade with India in the defense sector. While Ukraine was still a part of the Soviet Union, it was the base for about 30% of military industrial complex. Since the breakoff with Soviet Union, it is still in the process of modernizing its defense industrial facilitiesImportantly Kiev has been very friendly towards India since Soviet days and has been providing India best of opportunity for joint research and development along with co-production of the fifth generation fighter aircrafts and multirole transport aircrafts. In this regard, India and Ukraine have signed agreements to jointly develop and produce aircrafts in the model of BrahMos supersonic missiles and inked many such defense pacts to further expand their partnership in the fields of security to strengthen their already robust military arms and ammunitions business ties. In 2009, India and Ukraine inked a deal for upgrading 100 AN-32 medium transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force. Ukraine has already upgraded 25 of these planes while the rest would be modernized at IAF facilities in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh Having inherited defense industrial complex from the Soviet era, Ukraine has made best use of those defense manufacturing facilities to emerge as the world's top 10 defense producers, attaining the top status in manufacturing of battle tanks and military planesOne among all is the shipyard facility in Kiev that Ukraine has inherited from Moscow. India too uses Ukraine's shore-based takeoff and landing facilities to train its naval pilots to operate from the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov Furthering their defense pacts, Ukraine and India in the recent year have entered into a tie-up to co-develop a transport aircraft with Indian firms. If this fructifies, India and Ukraine may even decide to export the planes once their own domestic needs are met. Being a key developer of transport aircraft , Ukraine offers a lucrative defense program for India. India is in confusion and torn between Russia and Ukraine. Both the countries have been benevolent to India and shared great friendship through all weathers. In such a scenario, siding with one nation is not at all to the liking of India. However, India remained silent for some days and gave an official statement in February 2014 through the National Advisor, stating that certain ""legitimate Russian interests were involved in Crimea.This led to serious criticisms in several diplomatic quarters, interpreting this to be an endorsement of India of the Russian position in Ukraine. Reacting to the official position of India, the Ukrainian Ambassador to India responded strongly noting, ""We are not sure how Russia can be seen having legitimate interests in the territory of another country. While India's endorsement of Russian intervention in the internal matters of Ukraine can be interpreted differently, what needs to be noted here is how India will revive its relations with Ukraine post the crisis. Ukraine is a country which offers India lucrative deals and packages both in defense and science and technology and provides India a huge market for its pharmaceuticals and trade in goods, New Delhi. Therefore, it is better for India if the tension eases out in Ukraine and normalcy returns soon. Conclusion Whatever may be the nature of the crisis, Ukraine will be the biggest loser since Russia is its largest trade and economic partner. It is not only losing some billion dollars as fees for Russian gas transit through Ukraine but also earned an enemy in Kremlin by trying to go out of the Russian geopolitical orbit, which does not augur well for Kiev. Indeed, a new phase has started in Russo-Ukraine relations where the plight of Ukraine would be no better than Georgia. Further, the active intervention of the west in Ukraine has aggravated the ill-feeling between the two Slavic states. Given that the new Government in Ukraine is supported by the EU and the US, its relations with Russia is not going to be restored to normalcy at least in the foreseeable future. It is also to be taken as granted that Crimea will no longer be a part of Ukraine as it is quite clear from the referendum. In addition to having complete control over Crimea, Putin has to ensure that Russia resolves the crisis. Europe has a lesson to learn from the crisis, that is, not to meddle in the internal affairs of any former Soviet state. Because Russian attachment to the former Soviet states and its resurgence to power politics lately will not allow any interventionist attitude of the US. A lesson to be learnt for the US is that the Cold War days are over and the unipolar days are gone with the wind. Russia under Putin is a decisive and energetic power and is in a position to reclaim its prestige and power in global politics. As far as Indian apprehensions are concerned, the PMO and foreign office need to maintain caution while addressing the official position of India with regard to the Ukraine crisis. Although our friendship with Russia is sweet and longstanding, Ukraine as a valued partner of India in world politics should not be ignored. Maintaining equidistance is better than taking a unilateral stand without knowing well what the future holds."
edb9133e-8b4a-4509-82d6-b3cb108079f8,"News Stories and Documents By Carl Schreck January 1, 2015 WASHINGTON -- When Islamic State militants seized the Iraqi city of Fallujah in January, U.S. President Barack Obama likened the current crop of jihadists to a ""JV team,"" compared to Al-Qaeda. Six months later, IS jihadists overran Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, which they still control. Three months after that, Obama vowed to vanquish ""these terrorists are unique in their brutality"" and warned that they could pose a threat to the United States ""if left unchecked."" The militant group's unexpected and meteoric rise was among the numerous crises in the turbulent foreign policy waters the Obama administration navigated in 2014, from a hot war in Ukraine to talk of a new Cold War with Russia, an ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in Syria, to a seemingly unbreakable impasse in Israeli-Palestinian relations. ""Overall, the year has created the impression that it's an administration that's besieged,"" former U.S. State Department official David Kramer told RFE/RL. Foreign policy analysts say 2014 proved to be a year in which various international crises diverted Obama's energies from the domestic front and compelled him to deploy American military and economic might to try to stamp out fires in various corners of the globe. ""I think the president has made pretty clear that he would like to, as he says, focus on 'nation-building at home,'"" said Richard Fontaine, a former National Security Council staffer under Obama's predecessor, George W. ""And the problem is that the world isn't going to let him or any other president do that to the exclusion of the rest of the world."" Strange Bedfellows In Syria The rise of IS militants also presented complications in Obama's handling of the raging civil war in Syria, where he says President Bashar al-Assad has lost legitimacy for ""ruthlessly murder thousands of his citizens."" U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel conceded in October that Assad ""derives some benefit"" from U.S. military action targeting IS militants, who are also battling Assad's forces. Obama said weeks later that Washington is not considering coordinating with Assad to fight IS forces. ""There's no expectation that we are going to in some ways enter an alliance with Assad. He is not credible in that country,"" Obama said, adding that his administration was also not discussing removing Assad. The issue of balancing the fight against IS militants and the White House's position on Assad was the subject of a memo sent by Hagel to Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, in October in which he expressed ""concern about overall Syria strategy,"" a senior U.S. official told CNN. A month after he wrote the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times, Obama accepted Hagel's resignation amid reported tensions between the Pentagon chief and the president's closest advisers. Hot War, Cold War The so-called ""reset"" policy with Russia launched in Obama's first term had been on the rocks at least since President Vladimir Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012 after a four-year stint as prime minister. But the overthrow of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin ally, in February amid massive street protests in Kyiv and other major cities sparked a series of events that plunged U.S.-Russian ties to lows unseen since the end of the Cold War. The Kremlin proceeded to invade and annex Ukraine's Crimea territory in March, and fighting then erupted between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists that U.S., EU, and Ukrainian officials accuse Moscow of backing. Since the conflict between Ukrainian forces and the separatists exploded in April, more than 4,600 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine. The conflict has left more than half a million people internally displaced and forced hundreds of thousands of others to flee the country, according to UN officials. The Obama administration and EU allies imposed several waves of sanctions against senior Russian officials and wealthy businessman close to Putin in order to punish Moscow for its role in the conflict. These measures, Obama has argued, are taking a significant toll on the Russian economy, which has seen its currency's value plunge and is facing a potential recession amid tumbling global oil prices. But U.S. lawmakers have criticized the White House for not taking a more forceful stand against Russian aggression, including by providing lethal military aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, pro-Russian rebels continue to control areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, however, and 85 percent of Russians approve of the job Putin is doing as president, according to a November poll by the respected Levada Center. 'Poison' Atmosphere The collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians in April marked the second unsuccessful attempt by the Obama administration to facilitate a lasting agreement and strained ties between Washington and Tel Aviv. Months after the talks ended in an impasse, Israel launched a massive offensive in the Gaza Strip in a campaign to halt rocket fire by Hamas militants into Israeli territory. The Israeli operation left more than 2,000 Palestinians dead, most of them civilians, while dozens of Israeli soldiers were also killed. The pressure on Washington as a broker in the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate continued in December when the Palestinian Authority announced a draft UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands by November 2016 -- a move rejected by Israel. 'Big News' The Obama administration did boast of major foreign policy successes in 2014, including a landmark agreement with China on climate change last month. Under the agreement, which the White House described as ""big news"" in announcing it on Twitter, the United States would slash its carbon dioxide emissions by up to 28 percent by 2025 compared to 2005. China, meanwhile, announced that its emissions would peak in 2030. Meanwhile, negotiations by the United States and other world powers with Iran over its nuclear problem have not fallen through completely. The sides failed to reach a comprehensive deal with Iran on its nuclear program by the self-imposed November 24 deadline but have have extended the deadline until July 1, 2015. A deal could be complicated by a push by U.S. lawmakers to impose further sanctions on Tehran, which Western powers fear could obtain nuclear weapons. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended exclusively for peaceful purposes. Question Of Strategy Obama faced withering criticism in 2014 for what political opponents describe as a lack of strategy and vision for his foreign policy, which 54 percent of Americans disapproved of as of December 9 compared to 50percent at the beginning of the year, according to the Huffington Post's poll tracker, based on regularly updated data from 25 pollsters. Much of this criticism has, unsurprisingly, come from Republican lawmakers, though officials from his own party questioned his approach to global crises as well. After Obama told reporters in September that ""we don't have a strategy yet"" for combatting IS militants in Syria, U.S. Senator Al Franken wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder that he was ""troubled"" by the comment. The White House, meanwhile, ultimately did formulate what it called a strategy to ""degrade and destroy"" IS militants, one that included waves of air strikes targeting jihadists both in Iraq and Syria and authorizing the deployment of more than 3,000 troops to Iraq. It was a dramatic re-engagement of U.S. military forces in Iraq for a president who fulfilled a campaign promise in 2011 by declaring an end to the American-led war in Iraq and bringing U.S. troops home after nearly a decade of conflict there. Obama has repeatedly reassured war-weary Americans that U.S. military personnel in Iraq will be advising local forces and not be sent into combat. Fontaine, the former NSC staffer and president of the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, told RFE/RL that Obama's reluctance to move boldly on several policy fronts -- including with ""meaningful arming of the Syrian rebels"" and a residual force in Iraq -- can be traced to his wariness of his predecessor's policies. ""Some of the worries the world has and some of the events that have happened are at least arguably due in part to the desire to pull back from what the Obama administration saw as the excesses of the Bush administration's engagement abroad,"" Fontaine told RFE/RL. Whether Obama's last two years in office will offer any respite on the foreign policy front remains unclear. Less than a week before his resignation was announced, Hagel told the U.S. political talk show host Charlie Rose last month that his greatest concern is whether the United States and its leaders are ""going to be able to get through this time, which is a very defining time and a difficult time."" ""I told not too long ago, 'I don't know of a time that's it's been more difficult to be president of the United States or lead in this country than right now,"" Hagel said.

8b08aab3-7b9e-42b0-950c-fccb6a7eb5a1,"Russia announced plans to impose sanctions on an array of Turkish economic interests in response to Turkey's shootdown of a Russian warplane, as Ankara called for calm. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday told government ministers to prepare measures within two days restricting economic ties, including trade, tourism and joint investment projects, in response to what he called ""an act of aggression."" In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Moscow to drop its ""emotional"" stance over the incident and dismissed Russian demands for an apology. ""We do not find it correct to expand an incident -- where the whole world finds us to be right -- into political and economic areas,"" Mr. Erdogan said. Russia has responded furiously to the downing of its jet during a bombing campaign in Syria, an incident President Vladimir Putin on Thursday described as ""treacherous backstabbing by those we considered partners."" But Russia has played down the possibility of a military response to the incident, opting instead for measures that could punish Turkey's economy. While Russia didn't announced a full list of proposed measures on trade and tourism, Mr. Medvedev said restrictions against Turkey could be expanded to include financial and commercial transactions and bans on Turkish business in Russia. Russia's economy minister said plans to expand a natural-gas pipeline under the Black Sea would likely be put on hold, along with a nuclear-power station Russia is building and helping to finance in Turkey. Mr. Erdogan has previously said Turkey can find other partners to build its first nuclear plant. Moscow began implementing some measures against Ankara Thursday, even as Mr. Erdogan warned the Russian government against undermining ties by responding to the military incident with economic measures. Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachyov ordered tighter control on agricultural products from Turkey, including additional checks at the border and at production sites, saying 15% of Turkish products don't meet Russian standards. Harmful and prohibited substances had been found in some animal products, and excessive amounts of pesticides and nitrates had been discovered in fruit and vegetables, he said. Russia has introduced restrictions on imported foodstuffs amid tensions with other countries before. Past measures including a ban on wine from Georgia from 2006 and restrictions on various Ukrainian products. Russia banned European food products last year in response to Western sanctions. Turkish trucks seeking to enter Russia were subjected to long delays at the border on Thursday, according to trade organizations. Russian and Turkish leaders on Thursday continued verbal sparring over the incident, underscoring the deep divisions over Syria between Ankara and Moscow. Mr. Putin reiterated Russia's position that the aircraft was in Syrian airspace when it was downed, saying Turkey's leadership was ""intentionally pushing Russian-Turkish relations into a dead end"" amid the crisis. ""We have yet heard neither apologies from the high military and political level in Turkey, nor about compensating the damage, nor a promise to punish criminals for the offense committed,"" he said. Turkish officials continued to defend the shootdown, saying they had repeatedly warned Russian leaders about the risks their planes faced if they violated Turkish airspace, and that the Russian plane was warned several times before it was downed. ""If the same violation happened again today, Turkey would respond once again in the same manner,"" Mr. Erdogan said. The Turkish leader said Turkish forces didn't specifically target Russia in the strike. Turkey, he told CNN in an interview later, wouldn't be apologizing. Relations between Russia and Turkey, particularly in trade, have expanded rapidly in recent years. Trade between the countries stood at $18 billion in the first nine months of this year, according to Russia's Federal Customs Service, mostly accounted for by gas supplies to Turkey, the second-largest purchaser of the fuel from Russia. On a visit to Ankara in December 2014, Mr. Putin announced plans to expand a natural-gas pipeline and touted closer trade ties with Turkey, amid increased Russian isolation from the West over its interventions in Ukraine. Mr. Erdogan said at the time that he wanted to triple trade volumes to $100 billion by 2020. Since then, Turkish businesses made significant inroads into Russia, ramping up previously banned dairy exports and securing bargains in purchases ranging from wood to energy, according to the Moscow-based Russian Turkish Business Association. ""The Russians had provided Turkey with many advantages, we were finding ways to make investments we previously could not execute; many big companies were entering the market,"" said Oguz Kalaycioglu, trade adviser at the Russian Turkish Business Association. ""At this moment, practically all of our burgeoning trade is at risk."" Now, Turkey could lose around $12 billion, or around 1% of its annual gross domestic product, from Russian economic measures, according to Nomura International. --- Dion Nissenbaum contributed to this article.

6cf31d31-1247-41c3-91b3-f7305daa4928,"With the Pentagon's top expert saying that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons, both Russia and China are threats to the international order and U.S. global dominance, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Carter said that Russia poses a great threat to the world order with its military invasions in Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and the Baltic states, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's alarming actions with his country's nuclear weapons. Speaking to the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, Carter added that the U.S. defense establishment is actively seeking ways to deter Russian aggression and protect U.S. allies. He noted that China's expanding influence and increasing military might also pose great challenges to U.S. global dominance, saying that both Russia and China are conducting ""challenging activities"" at sea, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace. ""Most disturbing, Moscow's nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about Russian leaders' commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons,"" Carter said. Political and military experts noted that Carter's remarks were perhaps the strongest he has ever expressed about the United States' former Cold War enemy. However, Carter said that the White House does not seek a ""cold, let alone a hot, war"" with Russia, nor does it. seek to make Russia an enemy. ""But make no mistake; the United States will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all,"" he said. Carter's comments come amid Russia's ongoing military operation in Syria, in which it bombs U.S.-backed rebels and ISIS militants, while China makes confident steps at asserting its dominance outside of its borders. U.S. risks nuclear war with China and Russia With the ongoing hot conflict between Washington and Beijing over the disputed islands in the South China Sea, there is a high possibility of a military confrontation in the region, according to the authors of an op-ed published in The Age last week. Hugh White and Michael J. Cole argued that ""the harsh reality"" is that by supporting Taiwan against Chinese claims on its sovereignty, the U.S. risks unleashing a nuclear war against China. ""U.S. leaders might have to ask themselves whether they are willing to risk a nuclear attack on the continental US in order to defend Taiwan from China. If the answer is no, then Taiwan's status quo might become harder and harder to sustain,"" the authors wrote. And with Vladimir Putin recently ordering his security council to develop defensive nuclear equipment, the Pentagon says the Kremlin is poised to use nuclear weapons to ""bring a speedy peace,"" as reported by ValueWalk on Friday. But a war involving the world's two largest nuclear powers - Washington and Moscow - would ""probably spell, if not the end of humanity, the end of any possibility of a comfortable future for humanity,"" as reported by ValueWalk, citing Press TV's interview with Don DeBar, U.S. political analyst. Despite the deadly consequences, a nuclear war with China and Russia is ""our likely future,"" according to a Reagan-administration official. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former U.S. assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy, warned that Russia and China will never accept U.S. hegemony, which will likely bring more conflicts and confrontations between the two sides, including a nuclear war. Roberts also wrote earlier this year in his blog that China is ""confronted with the Pivot to Asia and the construction of new U.S. naval and air bases to ensure Washington's control of the South China Sea, now defined as an area of ""American National Interest."" ISIS, Russia and China threaten the global order: Carter Carter referred to several pillars of the global order that he believes must be protected and strengthened: respect for state sovereignty, freedom from coercion, peaceful resolution of disputes and freedom of navigation, all of which have been violated by China and Russia to some extent. ""Some actors appear intent on eroding these principles and undercutting the international order that helps enforce them,"" he said. ""Terror elements like ISIL, of course, stand entirely opposed to our values. But other challenges are more complicated, and given their size and capabilities, potentially more damaging."" He stated that neither Russia nor China can ""overturn"" that order, but both ""present different challenges"" for it. As for Russia's military operations in the Middle East, Carter accused Putin of escalating the situation. ""In Europe, Russia has been violating sovereignty in Ukraine and Georgia and actively trying to intimidate the Baltic states,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, in Syria, Russia is throwing gasoline on an already dangerous fire, prolonging a civil war that fuels the very extremism Russia claims to oppose."" Carter promises more U.S. patrols, China ready to respond militarily As for China, Carter promised more U.S. sea patrols in the South China Sea to demonstrate freedom of navigation. Two weeks ago, an American guided-missile destroyer, the USS Lassen, came within China's 12-nautical-mile zone around the Spratly archipelago. The incident sparked outrage among the Chinese, with China's Foreign Ministry issuing a statement in which it warned that the nation will defend its sovereignty, security and rights in the maritime space. And the Chinese side is ""ready to give an appropriate response to any country's provocations,"" according to the statement. The United States' decision to send additional patrols to the disputed area raises concerns about whether Beijing will be as restrained as it was two weeks ago or whether it will be prepared to respond militarily. ""As a rising power, it's to be expected that China will have growing ambitions and a modernizing military,"" Carter said. ""But how China behaves will be the true test of its commitment to peace and security."" He also added that Washington is shifting its focus toward the Asia-Pacific region with plans to deploy its best naval and other military equipment and ships to the area which China has large influence over. ""We are also changing fundamentally our operational plans and approaches to deter aggression, fulfill our statutory obligations to Taiwan, defend allies, and prepare for a wider range of contingencies in the region than we have traditionally,"" Carter said.

adba6709-a864-46d9-bc47-c4a3dc9b9d48,"Courtesy of ZeroHedge . Last week, tempers flared anew between Ankara and Moscow after Turkey accused Russia of violating its airspace near the Syrian border. This time around, Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador - a much more prudent course of action than shooting down a Russian warplane, which is what Ankara decided to do back in November. Of course every geopolitical action has an equal and opposite reaction. Russia's response to the downing of its Su-24 by Turkish F-16s was to tarnish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's international image by linking his government to Islamic State's illicit crude trade. The Kremlin's anti-Erdogan PR campaign came complete with dozens of videos depicting oil tankers barreling across Turkey's border with Syria unimpeded and the Russian Defense Ministry delighted in broadcasting footage of airstrikes that turned hundreds of the tankers to dust. Now, Russia is hitting back at Turkey after the latest spat over Moscow's alleged incursion into Ankara's airspace and once again, The Kremlin is breaking out the videos. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Turkey is shelling civilian areas in Syria from a border outpost. Igor Konashenkov showed video footage depicting the attacks at a press conference. ""This facility is a Turkish border outpost, which did not have any firing points a few months ago,"" he said, adding that "" This is called fact. This is irrefutable proof that the Turkish Armed Forces are shelling settlements on the Syrian border from heavy artillery systems. ""Play Video So why is Turkey shelling Syria you ask? Well that's an open question but there are two rather obvious possibilities. First, Ankara could be hitting the YPG, who Erdogan deeply distrusts and equates with the PKK. It's also possible Turkey is attempting to assist the opposition as Russia and Iran bear down on the rebels and militants. Sputnik said on Monday that one Syrian soldier was killed in shelling from Turkey in norther Latakia. ""At present, it is the region where the Syrian Armed Forces are carrying out an offensive against the Nusra Front militants and a number of other extremists,"" Sputnik notes. ""The jihadists aim to establish full control over the Turkish border, through which they regularly receive reinforcements such as equipment and fighters."" So Turkey, it would appear, is now actively involved in the ground battle - on the side of the terrorists. "" We expect an immediate reaction and explanations of the actions of Turkish military by NATO and the Pentagon ,"" Gen.

In particular, threats from Russian aggression, Chinese assertion in the South China Sea and terrorism will drive spending in coming years. Meanwhile, threats posed by North Korea and Iran have the potential to escalate quickly, and cyberwarfare risks are set to grow rapidly over the long term. These challenges will shape procurement priorities. Amid healthier domestic defence spending and increasing exports, the US defence sector outlook is brightening. That said, while the US will remain the largest defence exporter in the world for the foreseeable future, its share of the global market will reduce gradually longer term as other players such as China and Russia strengthen their positions.

Source: BMI, NATO In February 2016, the government requested USD619bn in defence funding under the FY2017 budget. This included base funding of USD523bn for the DoD (and USD7bn in mandatory funding for the DoD); USD58bn for overseas contingency operations; USD20bn for nuclear energy programmes; and USD8bn in non-DoD-related defence spending. The proposed budget has yet to be approved at the time of writing; Congress will resume negotiations following the November 2016 presidential election. For the army, the FY2017 budget request focuses on existing platforms undergoing upgrades, and the future armoured multipurpose vehicle under development by BAE Systems. Over the longer term, the army is seeking to replace its Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The request also includes funding for an amphibious combat vehicle programme. In the naval segment, the proposed budget covers acquisition of two Virginia-class attack submarines, two DDG51-class destroyers; one LHA8-class amphibious assault ship and two LCSs. The request also includes funding for R&D on the Columbia-class submarine programme, modernisation of 11 Aegis cruisers, and additional funding for CVN79/80-class aircraft carriers. A number of planned military aircraft acquisitions have been delayed according to the FY2017 budget request. The request covers the purchase of 43 F-35A fighters for the air force and the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 7 BMI Industry View Recent Updates United States Defence & Security Report 2016 purchase for 110 helicopters for the army . The navy has requested two F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets and 20 F-35C joint strike fighters. It has also proposed to lose one of its 10 carrier air wings. The Marine Corps has asked for funding for 16 short take-off/vertical landing variants of the F-35B, 78 AH-1Z/UH-1Y Cobra helicopters, and 16 MV-22 Osprey helicopters. The FY2017 budget request also proposes significant increases in US spending on cyberdefence and space programmes. In his annual assessment for 2016, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper identified attacks by 'homegrown' Islamist extremists as among the most imminent threats to US territory. In December 2015 a married couple allegedly inspired by Islamist extremists carried out an in San Bernardino, California, which resulted in 14 deaths. In June 2016, 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando by attackers who claimed affiliation to Islamic State. US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, in his speech on February 2 2016, listed Russia as a top threat to national security. In March 2016, the US Department of Defense announced the US' Eastern European military presence would be scaled up from 2017. In November 2015, President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law, providing a legal framework for the US to expend defence ties with South East Asian countries. The US has also stepped up 'Freedom of Navigation Operations' in the region, with US patrols sailing through what China perceives as sovereign territory in an effort to challenge the latter's sovereignty claims. The government in July 2015 announced plans to cut the US army by 40,000 active personnel by FY2018. 17,000 civilian employees are also to be cut from the Department of the Army. In July 2016, Obama announced that 8,400 US troops would remain in Afghanistan into 2017. Defence Industry Risk Reward Index US military spending is by far the highest globally, and the country retains its position as the largest defence exporter in the world. In addition, the US operational environment is highly competitive, as the country boasts strong levels of economic and investment openness, a highly skilled workforce and a solid industrial base. For these reasons, the US ranks in first place in our Developed States Defence Industry Risk Reward Index by some margin, with high scores across both the Risks and Rewards segments. We expect this to remain the case for the foreseeable future, given the role that the country plays in international security and its resultantly large military budgets, as well as the advanced capabilities of its local defence sector and high defence R&D investment levels. Nevertheless, we note that the military spending and capabilities gap with countries such as China are set to gradually narrow over the longer term. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 8 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 SWOT Defence Industry SWOT SWOT Analysis Strengths The US is the world's most influential defence actor at present, with a range of international security commitments. Given this role, the US military budget is the largest globally. The US has the most developed domestic defence industry globally, and is the world's largest defence exporter by some margin. Defence R&D investment levels are high on a global comparison. Weaknesses Military spending growth currently constrained by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Medium-term plans exist for reductions in armed forces personnel numbers. Efforts to strengthen ties to tech firms in Silicon Valley have yielded limited results to date. Opportunities The US is strengthening ties to allies in Asia, creating opportunities for higher volumes of defence exports to the region. Military spending likely to see healthier growth under the new president. Investment into defence R&D likely to be driven by growing concerns that the US military capabilities gap with countries such as China is narrowing. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 9 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 SWOT Analysis - Continued Threats Lower-than-expected economic growth in the US would likely negatively impact defence spending. Growing competition on the global defence market from emerging players such as Russia and China. US defence export control legislation to remain a barrier for sales to some overseas customers. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 10 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 BMI View: US defence spending will likely see healthier growth under the new president relative to the past five years, given that both candidates have indicated they would increase the military budget in campaign statements, and due to the diverse range of security challenges that the country is now facing. The US is set to remain the largest defence exporter in the world throughout the next decade, though its share of the global market will reduce gradually over the longer term as other players such as China and Russia strengthen their positions. Defence Expenditure The US Department of Defense has struggled with budget restrictions since 2010, amid adverse economic conditions. The 2011 Budget Control Act introduced defence funding caps, which have led to substantial cuts in targets for US defence spending out to FY2021 . This has negatively impacted US government investment into defence R&D and procurement, and led to reductions in armed forces personnel levels. In February 2016, the Obama administration requested USD619bn in defence funding under the FY2017 budget . This included base funding of USD523bn for the DoD ; USD58bn for overseas contingency operations; USD20bn for nuclear energy programmes; and USD8bn in non-DoD-related defence spending. The proposed budget, which has yet be approved at the time of writing, was largely in line with the past couple of years and meets the abovementioned spending caps . The various US armed forces branches have subsequently submitted additional funding requests. Congress will resume FY2017 budget negotiations following the November 2016 presidential election: in September, it approved a temporary measure to keep the DoD and wider government funded from the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1, through to December 9 2016.

This means that some procurement programmes will likely be delayed or reduced . That said, we believe US defence spending will see healthier growth under the new president relative to the past five years, based on previous campaign statements by both candidates and given the diverse range of security challenges that the US is facing. In particular, the threats from Russian aggression, Chinese assertion in the South China Sea and terrorism will continue to drive spending in the coming years. We note that threats posed by North Korea and Iran have the potential to escalate quickly, while also highlighting a Business Monitor International Ltd Page 12 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 growing focus on cyberwarfare throughout our forecast period and beyond. These threats will shape priorities in US defence procurement, which will focus on areas such as maritime security, ISR, missile and cyberdefence and aerospace. United States - Defence Expenditure, USDmn Brightening Outlook For US Defence Spending 2016-2020 = BMI forecasts; excludes pensions. Source: BMI, NATO The US is the largest defence exporter globally, accounting for a 33% share of the world total in 2015 . US defence exports have risen in recent years amid rapid growth in defence spending in key export markets, and as US defence companies have focused increasingly on overseas customers amid difficult economic conditions at home. Meanwhile, US defence imports have also grown over the past five years, reflecting the increasing globalisation of the industry. We expect the US to remain the world's largest defence exporter throughout our forecast period to 2025, given the local sector's advanced capabilities, the country's strong defence ties with a vast number of governments across the world, and US defence companies' growing focus on foreign sales. In particular, Asia, the Middle East and Europe will be lucrative markets for American defence companies over the coming decade. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 13 Defence Trade United States Defence & Security Report 2016 That said, the US' share of the global defence market is likely to reduce gradually over the long term, as other players such as China and Russia strengthen their position in segments such as aerospace, cybersecurity and ISR, and grow defence trade with their strategic allies. While US defence imports will continue to increase, the US government will continue to procure the vast majority of equipment from local companies , meaning the country will maintain a large defence trade surplus for the foreseeable future. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 14 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 US military spending is by far the highest globally, and the country retains its position as the largest defence exporter in the world. In addition, the US operational environment is highly competitive, as the country boasts strong levels of economic and investment openness, a highly skilled workforce and a solid industrial base.

The country receives a score of 75 out of 100 for Industry Rewards, placing first out of the nine developed states included in our rankings. Country Rewards The levels of economic and investment openness in the US are high, making the process of establishing in-country operations easy. Moreover, Washington has an exceptionally wide range of strategic international alliances and defence agreements with countries across the world - both fellow NATO members and EMs -which enables it to draw upon a number of potential export markets and trade partners. The US also has good access to manpower available for military services, boosting its Rewards score in our Index. Overall, the US scores a high 83 out of 100 for Country Rewards, again placing first in our rankings. Industry Risks Though US defence expenditure has seen cuts in recent years amid the government's austerity measures, we expect to see healthier budget growth under the new president. As such, we believe the country's military spending will remain the highest globally over our forecast period, providing ample contract opportunities both for local and foreign defence suppliers in the coming years. Overall, the US scores 65 out of 100 for Industry Risks, ranking first out of nine developed states. Country Risks Investors in the US will face low levels of corruption, which means that the associated risks of hidden costs, loss of physical or intellectual property and biased court rulings are limited. The country does face growing threats from terrorist organisations; however, the security risks linked to establishing operations in the US are very low. Meanwhile, the local manufacturing sector is well developed, which reduces the costs of setting up an industrial base. The quality of the American labour market is high on a global comparison, and businesses are likely to be able to find skilled workers in-country. Due to these factors, the US receives a high score of 81 out of 100 for Country Risks, once again ranking top out of the nine states included in our RRI. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 16 Risks United States Defence & Security Report 2016 BMI View: We hold a relatively positive outlook on the US defence sector over the coming years, as we believe the US defence budget will see healthier growth under the next president and as we expect defence spending across many of the US' key defence export markets to expand substantially throughout our forecast period to 2025 . A diverse range of threats, from both state and non-state actors, spanning the conventional, nuclear and cyber segments, will translate into strong US demand for defence equipment across all market segments - but particularly in ISR, maritime security, aerospace, missile and cyber defence. Domestic Defence Market The US possesses the largest and most competitive defence sector in the world - largely the result of the country's high defence spending compared globally, as well as a strong focus on defence research and development . American companies produce much of the most technologically advanced equipment available across all segments of the defence market today, and the US accounted for over 33% of global defence exports in 2015 . The largest US defence export category is aircraft, followed by air defence systems, armoured vehicles, artillery, engines, missiles, naval weapons, sensors and ships. In recent years, budget restrictions have negatively impacted US defence procurement and R&D. As a result, American defence companies have increasingly focused on external markets, with many also expanding their civilian segment businesses. We hold a relatively positive outlook on the US defence sector over the coming years, as we believe the US defence budget will see healthier growth under the next president , and as we expect defence spending across many of the US' key defence export markets to expand substantially throughout our forecast period to 2025 . Key Development Programmes: F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter: A fifth-generation joint strike fighter aircraft programme led by Lockheed Martin. In addition to the US, the USD1trn programme involves nine partner nations with another three foreign military sales customers. The aircraft consists of 300,000 parts from 1,500 international suppliers. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 17 Market Overview Defence Market Overview United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Lockheed Martin describes the F-35 Lightning II as 'a fifth-generation fighter, combining advanced stealth with fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment'. The US air force is the single largest customer of the programme. KC-46A Pegasus tanker: an aerial refuelling tanker developed by Boeing. The programme was awarded a USD2bn contract by the US air force in August 2016 for initial low-rate production. Columbia-class submarine: a programme to replace the US navy's Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. Procurement of the first vessel is scheduled for 2021, with advanced procurement funding to be awarded from 2017.

Designed to 'defeat growing littoral threats and provide access and dominance in the coastal water battlespace', according to Lockheed Martin. Stryker armoured vehicle: an eight-wheel, medium-weight armoured vehicle, designed to manoeuvre in close and urban terrains. The main contractor is General Dynamics Land Systems. Abrams tank: a main battle tank, manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems. According to the GDLS website, the vehicle has been designed with a strong focus on survivability, in addition to mobility, lethality, adaptability and maintainability. Joint light tactical vehicle : The JLTV, for which Oshkosh received a USD30bn contract in 2015, is to replace the US army's AM General High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle currently in service. The vehicle is being developed with a particular focus on high-level ballistic/mine protection and cross-country mobility. Key domestic players are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, United Technologies and L-3 Communications . Lockheed Martin, headquartered in Maryland, is the largest security and aerospace company in the world. It is a market leader in the provision of air platforms, and the biggest military aircraft manufacturer globally. Lockheed Martin is also a major service provider in the sea and land domains. As well as developing complete platforms, the company has substantial expertise in the subsystem domain and in the civilian aerospace sector. Boeing is the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, jetliners and military aircraft. Military aircraft technology includes: advanced systems for surveillance and reconnaissance, airborne antisubmarine warfare and intelligence, global strike systems, and guided missiles. Missile defence products include the Ground-Based Midcourse Defence system. United Technologies' business spans the commercial aerospace, defence and building industries. The defence segment accounts for around 12% of its net sales. It includes aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems. In 2015, United Technologies announced the USD9bn sale of helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft to Lockheed Martin. Raytheon is a major provider of electronics, mission systems integration and, according to its website, 'other areas of sensing; effects, and command, control, communications and intelligence systems'. It was ranked the fourth largest defence company globally in 2015 by Defense News. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 19 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Directly behind Raytheon in the 2015 rankings is General Dynamics, headquartered in Virginia. The company has four core businesses, namely aerospace, combat systems, information systems & technology and marine systems. Northrop Grumman has accrued substantial experience in the aerospace sector, providing complete platforms along with major subsystems. In recent years, the company has also deepened its expertise in the field of land systems, along with enlarging its civilian business. L-3 Communications, a subsidiary of L-3 Communications Holding is another world-leading defence contractor, with expertise in the defence electronics sector. The company has a global presence and develops specialist products across the land, sea and air domains. In addition, the firm has a thriving business in the civilian sector, specialising in satellite communications and aerospace technology. Strengthening Ties To Silicon Valley? In recent years the US DoD has made efforts to strengthen ties to non-traditional defence suppliers, with a particular focus on forming partnerships with tech companies in Silicon Valley. The Pentagon has established a research hub in California to this end - the DIU. The initiative is driven by concerns regarding the US' narrowing military capabilities gap with countries such as China and Russia and the future global competitiveness of the US' defence sector. The DoD is looking to maintain its qualitative edge and speed up defence equipment development through closer cooperation with commercial technology firms. This trend may become more pronounced in coming years, should funding for such initiatives increase and procurement processes be made simpler, in turn putting competitive pressure on traditional defence suppliers. That said, this depends on the level of support for the programme from the new US administration following the November 2016 election. We also note the lingering distrust among elements of the US tech industry towards the government following the Edward Snowden case of 2013 as a potential barrier to this development. Foreign Players Entry into the US defence market by foreign players can be difficult, given the highly developed capabilities of local defence companies, and the government's view that most large US defence contracts should be awarded locally. Nevertheless, the large size of the market means there are still significant opportunities in the country for external players with advanced technological capabilities in niche areas, particularly through Business Monitor International Ltd Page 20 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 cooperation with US firms. An example of this is the fifth-generation joint strike fighter aircraft programme, which involves over 1,500 international suppliers. France's defence & security electronics producer Thales is represented in the US by Thales USA. Thales has several joint ventures based in the US, including ThalesRaytheonSystems , DRS Sonar Systems and ACSS. The three of them serve both military and civil aviation customers. TRS focuses on air operation command and control systems, surveillance radars and ground-based weapon-locating radars. DRS Sonar Systems, a JV between DRS and Thales, develops and markets undersea warfare systems for defence applications. ACSS, meanwhile, is a JV between L-3 Communications and Thales. European aerospace giant Airbus is active in the North and Latin American markets through the US-based Airbus Americas. Israeli electronics manufacturer Elbit Systems has a US subsidiary named Elbit Systems of America. Elbit Systems of America also owns other US-based companies, such as EFW, Kollsman, International Enterprises, Innovative Concepts, Tallahassee Communications Industries and 50% of Vision Systems. Another Israeli defence company with a US-presence is Israel Aerospace Industries - through IAI North America and Stark Aerospace. Global defence industry giant BAE Systems has a presence in the US through its subsidiary BAE Systems Inc. A range of other European defence manufacturers are also active in the US, including Italy's Leonardo-Finmeccanica , Germany's small arms and ammunition manufacturer Heckler & Koch and Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen. Meanwhile, Canada has defence agreements with the US that allows it access to the American market on the same terms as local companies. 80% of Canada's defence exports are directed towards the US. The US is facing a diverse range of threats - from both state and non-state actors, spanning the conventional, nuclear and cyber segments. This will translate into strong US demand for defence equipment across all market segments over the coming years -particularly maritime, aerospace, ISR, nuclear and cyber and missile defence. As we expect the next US president to increase military spending , we believe the US defence market outlook will brighten from 2017 onwards, compared to the previous five years. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 21 Domestic Defence Market United States Defence & Security Report 2016 FY2017 Budget Request Ground Vehicles: The FY2017 budget request focuses on the US army's existing platforms - the Stryker, Abrams and Bradley - which are undergoing upgrades, as well as the future armoured multipurpose vehicle under development by BAE Systems. Over the longer term, the army is seeking to replace its Bradley infantry fighting vehicles with a 'future fighting vehicle'. The JLTV, intended to replace the Humvee, has entered low-rate production . The request also includes funding for an amphibious combat vehicle programme, established to meet a US Marine Corps requirement. Shipbuilding: the proposed FY2017 budget included the acquisition of two Virginia-class attack submarines ; two DDG51-class destroyers ; one LHA8-class amphibious assault ship and two LCSs . Over the five years to FY2021, the US navy is looking to procure a total of 38 ships. The FY2017 budget request also included funding for R&D on the Columbia-class submarine programme , the modernisation of 11 Aegis cruisers, and additional funding for CVN79/80-class aircraft carriers. Aircraft: a number of the US armed forces' planned aircraft acquisitions have been delayed. In terms of the air force, the FY2017 budget request includes funding for the acquisition of 43 F-35A fighters and for the B-21 development programme . For the army, funding for helicopters has been reduced substantially, covering 110 units, down from 144 projected in FY2016. Included are 36 UH-60M Black Hawks, 22 CH-47 Chinooks and 52 AH-64 Apaches. For FY2017, the navy has requested two F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets and 20 F-35C joint strike fighters. It also proposes to lose one of its 10 carrier air wings. The Marine Corps, meanwhile, has asked for funding for 16 short take-off/vertical landing variants of the F-35B, 78 AH-1Z/UH-1Y Cobra helicopters, and 16 MV-22 Osprey helicopters. The FY2017 defence budget also proposes significant increases in US spending on cyberdefence and space programmes. BMI View: The US armed forces may see some cuts in overall personnel numbers in the short-to-medium term, given budget constraints. However, given the range of threats currently faced by the country, and the Business Monitor International Ltd Page 22 Armed Forces Overview United States Defence & Security Report 2016 fact that Washington views the maintenance of its global military dominance in future as vital, drastic reductions in the force's size over the longer term are unlikely. President Obama's successor is likely to raise military spending, which means current force size reduction targets for the coming years may be revised once they assume office. The US military consists of five distinct branches, namely the army, navy, marine corps, air force and coast guard. As of August 31 2016, the overall number of US armed forces personnel stood at 1,343,912, with 475,333 serving in the army, 327,077 in the navy, 184,250 in the marine corps, 316,958 in the air forces and 40,294 in the coast guard, according to the US Defense Manpower Data Center . The overall number of reserves stood at 820,773. Table: Armed Forces Personnel Total armed forces, '000s 1,4011,4181,4271,4251,3991,3821,3381,310Total armed forces, % of population 00000000 Source: BMI, NATO The US government in July 2015 announced plans to cut the US army by 40,000 active personnel by FY2018, given budget restrictions. This would take the force down to a total of 450,000 personnel. In addition, 17,000 civilian employees are to be cut from the Department of the Army in the same timeframe. The reduction is in line with the trend seen over the previous five years , which experienced a13% decrease in army staff. According to the Department of Defense's 'Future Years Defense Plan' the number army personnel is to remain at 450,000 out to 2021. The navy would also see active personnel cuts in the short term, down to a targeted 322,900 in 2017 -before increasing slightly, averaging 323,300 for the remainder of the FYDP period . These targets - outlined in recently released budget documents , have been lowered from the previous year, again as a result of fiscal pressures. According to the FYDP, the US Marine Corps and Air Force would see largely flat growth in personnel levels out to 2021. That said, we do note that the latter has requested a personnel increase up to 321,000 for FY2017, after the budget release date. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 23 Armed Forces United States Defence & Security Report 2016 If these targets are maintained by the next US president, then the overall size of the US military would see some reduction over the medium term. That said, given the range of threats currently faced by the US, and the fact that Washington seeks to maintain its global military dominance in future, we believe drastic cuts to personnel levels over the longer term are unlikely. We note that Hillary Clinton, and in particular, Donald Trump have indicated they would raise military spending if elected to office, which means these targets may be revised from 2017. United States - Armed Forces Personnel, '000s Personnel Levels Impacted By Budget Constraints Source: BMI, NATO Current Deployments As of June 2016, the DMDC estimates the overall figure of US active duty personnel stationed overseas at 201,433 . The US maintains large numbers of personnel in South Korea to counter the North Korean threat. We expect this to remain the case for the foreseeable future, as North Korea remains a key security challenge both to the South and the US, and as the latter's work to develop South Korean military capabilities will take Business Monitor International Ltd Page 24 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 a number of years. The US also has a large number of troops in Japan - although American military presence in the country is unpopular amid elements of the population given crimes against locals allegedly carried out by US military personnel. Nevertheless, we expect the US to maintain a high number of troops in Japan throughout our forecast period to 2025, given rising regional tensions and threats posed by North Korea and China. For similar reasons, we expect the US to strengthen its military presence in other allied countries in the Asia-Pacific in coming years. In Europe, the US has thousands of troops in Germany - and to a lesser extent, Italy and the UK, reflecting the role that the US plays in NATO. Following Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine in 2014, Washington decided to strengthen the US military presence along NATO's eastern borders, to counter the Russian threat and demonstrate its commitment to the Alliance. In addition to the around 62,000 US personnel permanently assigned to Europe, another 4,200 have been deployed to the continent on rotation since 2014. In March 2016, the US Department of Defense announced the US' eastern European military presence would be scaled up further from 2017. President Barack Obama initially announced US withdrawal from Afghanistan from 2011, however, thousands of American troops remain in the country to this day given local forces' still-limited capabilities, and the persistently high threat of Islamist militant groups. In July 2016, Obama announced that 8,400 US troops would remain in Afghanistan into 2017, given the 'precarious security situation'. While we do expect a gradually reduction in the overall deployment size, we believe the US will maintain a military presence in Afghanistan over the next several years, as work to build up domestic security forces will take time. The US has a large military presence across much of the Middle East, amid efforts to provide support to its allies in the region, secure oil exports, counter Islamist militancy and the Iranian threat. Over 3,000 are stationed in Iraq, where they provide support to local armed forces fighting Islamic State . Significant numbers are also deployed to smaller Gulf states, including Bahrain, Kuwait and the UAE. American troops are assigned to a number of countries across Africa; however, the overall size of deployments is relatively limited. We expect this to remain the case in the coming years, given pressing military commitments elsewhere, and the view among many in Washington that military support to African states should be led by European states, which are geographically closer and have historical and cultural ties to the continent. While the US has been involved in counter-IS operations in Libya over recent quarters, we note that the group's presence in the country has reduced substantially, and as a result we do not expect the US military presence there to increase dramatically in the near term. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 25 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 US military presence in Latin America is also relatively limited, and primarily focused on supporting local drug trafficking combat operations. We expect this to remain the case over the coming years.

Source: DMDC Business Monitor International Ltd Page 27 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 BMI View: The US will face a diverse range of security threats of the coming decade. These stem from both state and non-state actors, and span the conventional, nuclear and cyber segments. A key challenge for the US will be to prepare for the handling of escalations in several of these threats simultaneously. Meanwhile, though the American military is still by far the most developed in the world, the capability gap with its rapidly modernising equivalents in major countries such China will gradually narrow over the coming decade. Domestic Threats Extremist Movements According to an FBI national threat assessment report for 2014, obtained by media that same year, the bureau identifies eight types of domestic extremist movements: anti-government militia groups; anarchists; white supremacy extremists; violent animal rights extremists; anti-abortion activists; pro-abortion activists; black separatists; and Puerto Rican nationalists. The report did not cover Islamist terrorism, at the time identifying this as an external threat. It assessed the domestic extremist threat as moderate or 'low-medium', with the expectation that it would remain at the same level over coming years. The report did note that high-profile racially charged crimes or clashes could lead to an increase the black separatist threat in future, warning that a scenario in which radical black activists reinitiate violence comparable to those levels seen in the 1970s - as a result of perceptions of devolving racial equality or observation of racially-motivated police brutality or racially biased injustice or judicial rulings - could not be ruled out. As an example, the report highlighted the protests and civil disorder that took place on the day of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, August 9 2014. In turn, an escalation in racial tension across the US would likely raise the security threat posed by the country's white supremacy extremists. 'Homegrown' Islamist Extremists In his annual assessment for 2016, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper identified attacks carried out by 'homegrown' Islamist extremists as among the most imminent threats to US soil. He noted that the 'perceived success' of attacks by Islamist extremists on the West in recent years could serve to motivate others to carry out similar actions in the US 'with little or no warning'. Illustrating this threat is the December 2 2015 attack by a married couple allegedly inspired by Islamist extremists in San Bernardino, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 28 Security Overview United States Defence & Security Report 2016 California, which resulted in 14 deaths. Moreover, in June 2016, 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando by attackers who claimed affiliation to IS. Indeed, according to a summary by the Homeland Security Committee from September 2015, the total number of US terrorist cases involving 'homegrown violent jihadists' jumped from 38 in July 2010 to 124 at the time of publishing. We expect the threat of attacks by homegrown Islamist extremists within the US to remain relatively elevated over the coming years, as elements of the country's Muslim population are radicalised and inspired by international Islamist militant groups such as IS and al-Qaeda - a process increasingly facilitated by the accessibility of relevant information and networks online - and as the US continues its involvement in counterterrorism campaigns abroad. Though US counterterrorism forces are considered among, if not - the -most capable globally, attacks by homegrown Islamist extremists can be difficult to prevent, particularly if carried out by so-called 'lone wolfs' with limited or no links to known terrorist organisations. Regional Threats The US does have outstanding territorial disputes in the region. Specifically, the US has an outstanding dispute over the sovereignty of the Arctic Ocean off Canada's northwest coast. The two countries disagree on how to divide the Beaufort Sea, as well as the position of the so-called 'Northwest Passage' - though they continue to cooperate on surveys of the Arctic Continental Shelf. Meanwhile, the US and Bahamas disagree on a maritime border. That said, the risk of these disputes resulting in interstate conflict is negligible, given strong political and economic ties between the parties involved. Transnational Crime/Trafficking Trafficking of narcotics - including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana - from Latin America - poses a security challenge to the US. This activity continues to be dominated by Mexican, and to a lesser degree, Colombian criminal organisations: the latter is a top supplier of cocaine and heroin to the US, while the former is s key transit country for cocaine, and also a major supplier of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine to the North American market. In addition, the US continues to act as both a transit country and destination for human trafficking, illegal immigration and arms smuggling from Latin America. According to the 2015 DEA National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican transnational criminal organisations pose by far the biggest criminal drug threat to the US at present, and will continue to do so, at least over the short term, as no other organisations currently have the infrastructure and influence to challenge their control of the North American drug market. Mexican gangs are actively attempting to increase their share of this market, primarily serving as wholesale suppliers in order to avoid US low Business Monitor International Ltd Page 29 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 enforcement. Meanwhile, Colombian traffickers are increasingly using the Caribbean as a gateway to the US, in order to avoid cartel-related violence and increased law enforcement presence in Mexico. Colombian criminal organisations' presence within the US centres on the East Coast. Dominican gangs are heavily involved in the transport and distribution of drugs within the US. With transnational criminal gangs - whose operations are becoming increasingly sophisticated - working to expand in the US drug market, and drug use across many segments continuing to increase among the American population, we expect drugs trafficking from Latin America to remain a major security challenge to the US over the longer term. While Mexican organisations will continue to pose the most prominent threat, increasing trafficking through the Caribbean may present a growing issue in the coming years. International Threats US - Russia US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, in his speech on February 2 2016, listed Russia as a top threat to national security, and suggested sharp increases in the US' military spending and presence in Europe to deter Russian aggression. Tensions between Moscow and Washington - and NATO, more broadly - have been on the rise in recent years, particularly following the latter's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and more recently, as a result of their conduct in the Syrian civil war in recent months . In September 2016, Russia accused the US of deliberately targeting Syrian government troops in an airstrike that Washington claimed was a mistake, while the US accused Russia of bombing a UN humanitarian convoy near Aleppo. Russia subsequently stepped up airstrikes in Aleppo in support of the Syrian government, prompting Washington to suspend diplomatic contacts with Moscow on October 3. On the same day, Moscow announced it was withdrawing from a 2000 agreement under which both the US and Russia must dispose of stored plutonium that might otherwise be used to manufacture nuclear weapons -indicating that heightening bilateral tensions over Syria will be affecting other aspects of US-Russia relations, such as the security situation in Eastern Europe, cyberwarfare and even domestic politics on both sides. In our view, Washington will continue to view Russia as a major security threat for the foreseeable future, given long-term differences and factors including: Legacy of mistrust: Russian and the US continue to view each other with deep suspicion. Moscow believes Washington is looking to overthrow pro-Russia leaders in Eurasia for the purpose of weakening Business Monitor International Ltd Page 30 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Russia geopolitically, and ultimately seeking 'regime change' in Moscow itself. For its part, Washington sees Russia as the world power most actively challenging the US-led international order. NATO expansion: Moscow objects to NATO's expansion in Eastern Europe, viewing it as aimed at containing Russia. In particular, it fears the potential inclusion of Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance . Meanwhile, the US and many of its Eastern European allies feel vindicated in expanding NATO in light of Russia's brief invasion of Georgia in 2008 and its intervention in Ukraine in 2014 . US missile bases in Eastern Europe: Similarly, Russia sees the US' establishment of ballistic missile defence systems in Romania and Poland as aimed at countering Russian missiles, rather than their stated purpose of countering Iranian missiles. Moscow fears these bases will eventually form a wider missile defence shield designed to undermine Russia's nuclear arsenal and thus negate the concept of mutually assured destruction. Cybersecurity: The US and Russia remain suspicious of each other's cyberactivities. US leaders believe Russia has conducted substantial hacking into the US, including into the Democratic National Committee's systems in July, and remain angry about the continued presence of fugitive National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in Russia. Less is known about US hacking into Russia's computer networks, but Moscow remains suspicious. According to our CR team, a Hillary Clinton presidency would be highly likely to adopt a tougher stance on Russia, as she is known to favour robust US leadership on global security issues. Clinton as president could conceivably seek to impose a no-fly zone in Syria, attack the Syrian regime, or step up weapons supplies to Syrian rebels, all of which would incense Russia and increase the risk of direct US-Russia confrontation. Meanwhile, a Donald Trump presidency would offer opportunities for a rapprochement, owing to Trump's seemingly Russia-friendly positions. However, this would be far from assured, because Trump's volatile personality and habit of making unguarded comments could lead to confusion in Moscow about his true beliefs and policies. Moreover, Trump favours a robust US military profile, and even if this is not directly aimed at Russia, a Trump-initiated military build-up would still be viewed as a potential threat to Russia itself. US - China China presents a key long-term security challenge to the US. China is the only one country that could emerge as a possible alternative global hegemon to the US, and it has become increasingly assertive in recent years. Overall, we expect the two countries to step up their competition for influence in Asia for the foreseeable future . China has become increasingly confident on the world stage over the past couple of decades, as its economy has boomed. Beijing has slowly but steadily modernised its armed forces, including the development of a blue-water navy for the protection of China's trade routes and commercial interests overseas. Meanwhile, Business Monitor International Ltd Page 31 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 from 2010, China began behaving increasingly assertively towards Japan over the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, and towards the Philippines and Vietnam over disputed islands and areas in the South China Sea. This has prompted Tokyo, Manila, and Hanoi to look to Washington to counterbalance Beijing in Asia. More broadly, most Asian countries have sought to counterbalance deepening economic ties with China by maintaining or strengthening security ties with the US. These security ties have gained greater urgency since 2013, when China started building artificial islands in the South China Sea that could be used to station air and naval forces . In November 2015, President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law, providing a legal framework for the US to expend defence ties with South East Asian countries. The US has also stepped up 'Freedom of Navigation Operations' in the region, with US patrols sailing through what China perceives as sovereign territory in an effort to challenge the latter's sovereignty claims. In response, the Chinese military has carried out snap air and naval drills in the area. We note that a scenario in which an accident, miscalculation or provocation by either superpower escalate this geopolitical struggle into an outright war cannot be ruled out. That said, though tensions are mounting, the likelihood of a US-China war is low: this would be highly unfavourable for both countries given the severe global economic repercussions such an event would have. China's 2015 Defence White Paper emphasises the importance of some level of military cooperation with the US, stating: 'China's armed forces will continue to foster a new model of military relationship with the US armed forces that conforms to the new model of major-country relations between the two countries, strengthen defence dialogues, exchanges and cooperation'. Nonetheless, we highlight that although Beijing does not seek conflict with the US, this does not mean China will not resort to creating or exploiting military crises in the South China Sea to further its own strategic goals and thwart US efforts to preserve its influence in the region. Beyond 2016, we believe both a Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump presidency would adopt a tougher line towards China, with the former driven primarily by geopolitical priorities, and the latter by more protectionist economic policy . Overall, we believe a deterioration in Sino-US relations as a result is likely. A Clinton presidency would accelerate the US' stated 'pivot' towards Asia, whereas Trump would reduce support for traditional American allies such as Japan and South Korea. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 32 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 US - North Korea North Korea is the most militarised country in the world in terms of armed forces' troop strength as a percentage of the total population . Its entire defence posture is based on the need to deter three main external enemies: the US, South Korea, and Japan. The US is declared enemy number one, while South Korea is considered an enemy mainly because it is perceived as a US puppet state willing to attack the North on Washington's behalf. Japan is despised due to its colonisation of the Korean Peninsula in 1910-1945 and Pyongyang's perception that Tokyo is rearming under American auspices. North Korea's nuclear weapons programme remains the main obstacle to improving relations with the US and many other countries. The US has deployed tens of thousands of troops in South Korea in order to defend its ally against North Korean aggression. Although North Korea's long-range missiles may not be able to hit continental US, and although Pyongyang has substantial conventional retaliatory capabilities against the South and Japan, possession of a nuclear arsenal substantially raises the psychological ante. On September 9 2016, North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, further demonstrating its determination to press ahead with developing nuclear arms, regardless of domestic economic and international political consequences . We believe the test was partly motivated to signal to the next US president that Pyongyang is a fully fledged nuclear power, and that Washington will have to accept this reality. In our view, North Korea's leadership favours the election of Donald Trump as US president, as he has publicly stated his willingness to hold direct talks with Kim Jong Un. This is a complete break with previous US presidents or presidential candidates, who have never suggested head-to-head meetings. However, as we view Clinton as more likely to win the November election, we expect broad continuation of the current US policy towards North Korea. That being said, the possibility of US military action in North Korea appears remote for the foreseeable future, given the latter's massive conventional and nuclear retaliatory capabilities, and the fact that this would probably start a new war on the Korean Peninsula - one that could rapidly escalate beyond control and devastate South Korea, while drawing in China and Japan. US - Iran Prospects of genuine improvement in relations between Iran and the US are the best they have been since the late 1990s. Should the nuclear deal between the P5+1 and Iran hold - successfully Business Monitor International Ltd Page 33 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 preventing or strictly limiting Iranian nuclear activities over the next decade and in return facilitating Iranian economic growth - then this will substantially reduce the threat of military engagement between the two sides. That said, much depends on the outcome of upcoming presidential elections in both states, which could result in new leaderships that take a more hard-line stance against the other country. Hillary Clinton - who, as mentioned - we perceive as the most likely candidate to win the US elections in November - has endorsed the nuclear deal, and we believe she will choose to preserve it, as it has greatly reduced the risk of war with Iran . In addition, the US can ill afford to raise tensions with Iran at a time when it is facing the conundrum of how to defeat IS - which Tehran is also keen to see destroyed. Even so, Clinton is likely to adopt a cooler attitude towards Iran than Obama. Clinton's strong commitment to Israel means she would take a tough line towards any Iranian moves that hurt Israel's security. Clinton would also be more likely to speak out against human rights violations in Iran and champion anti-regime dissidents in Iran, both of which would raise Tehran's ire. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has described the Iran nuclear deal as a 'disaster', leading to speculation that he might seek to renegotiate it in part or in whole. However, he would have reason for caution as any attempt to do so would likely be regarded in Tehran as an abandonment of the deal, with potentially significant domestic repercussions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dedicated a great deal of political capital on the negotiations, which were reluctantly backed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself. A breakdown of the deal ahead of Iran's May 19 2017 presidential election would severely undermine the position of Rouhani, potentially paving the way for a hardliner to be elected president. Were that to happen, relations between Iran and the West would deteriorate once again, and Iran could revive its nuclear programme. The risk of an Israeli or US strike on Iran would once again rise. More broadly, significant opposition to closer relations with the US remain in Iran, due to the legacy of mistrust that has prevailed since 1979 . In addition, while a lasting agreement would significantly reduce the risk of US military action against Iranian nuclear facilities, the two countries' regional security interests will still diverge, which means the potential for tension to escalate persists. For example, Tehran's support for Assad's regime in Syria, and its assistance to radical Shi'a groups such as Hizbullah and Hamas, are directly opposed to US aims and policies in the Middle East. Although unlikely, even with the deal remaining in place, we therefore cannot exclude the possibility of an attack by US armed forces on Iranian proxies in the region - or vice versa - resulting in a deterioration of relations. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 34 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 That said, there also remains a possibility that the nuclear deal - if upheld - could result in a very gradual wider US-Iran rapprochement over the long term, as Iran becomes more integrated with the rest of the world and ties between Washington and Tehran strengthen. Afghanistan Despite President Obama's initial decision to withdraw from Afghanistan from 2011, the US maintains a significant military presence in the country to this day. This is largely due to the limited capabilities of Afghanistan's current security structures, particularly in the context of Islamist militancy, as the threat of Taliban and IS expanding their presence in the country persists. In July 2016, Obama announced that 8,400 US troops would remain in Afghanistan into 2017, given the 'precarious security situation'. While we do expect a gradually reduction in the overall deployment size, we believe the US will maintain a military presence in Afghanistan over the next several years, as work to build up domestic security forces will take time. Islamic State US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in his February 2016 annual threat assessment statement that IS poses the biggest security threat among militant groups at present, because of the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria, and its determination to launch attacks on US soil. At present, the US is leading international air strikes against IS targets in Syria and Iraq, and has stationed around 3,500 troops in Iraq to train the local armed forces. In addition, the US provides weapons and training to what it perceives as moderate rebel groups in Syria. President Obama has been extremely reluctant to put US troops on the ground in the fight against IS, following unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the recent past. The next US president will face pressure to prioritise the fight against IS, with both the US and several of its allies already having suffered a number of attacks organised or inspired by the group . Given that IS territory comprises parts of Syria and Iraq, this means Washington will have to define a clearer policy towards those countries. Counting in the US' favour, IS has already suffered significant territorial setbacks in its heartland, and has also lost ground in Libya, where the group established a presence in the city of Sirte in 2015. However, there is a danger that IS could lash out in desperation by carrying out more attacks against the West and its allies. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 35 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 At the very least, we would expect either Clinton or Trump to intensify the air campaign against IS, with a view to accelerating its defeat amid growing political pressure. Beyond this, despite her hawkish reputation, Clinton appears opposed to sending a large US ground force to fight the group. Indeed, there would be a risk that the US becomes bogged down in another guerrilla war in the Muslim world, for the third time in less than two decades. Nevertheless, with the Obama administration having already deployed 4,000 military advisers to Iraq and Syria, Clinton may well be tempted to expand this number. For his part, Trump has sent mixed signals on the deployment of ground troops. In late 2015, he warned of the dangers of such a move, citing the negative US experience in Afghanistan and Iraq. In March 2016 Trump stated that he might send 20,000-30,000 ground troops to fight IS, and in July he said that he would send 'very few' troops. Overall, we believe that he would most probably expand the existing ground presence in Iraq and Syria, like Clinton. The trigger for a large-scale US ground force would probably be a new terrorist attack attributed to IS in the US itself. However, even Trump's earlier suggestion of 30,000 troops might not be enough. US intelligence estimates that IS has 30,000 fighters, and based on a 3:1 ratio assumed by the US military for an invasion, the Pentagon would need 90,000 combat troops to defeat IS, with many more thousands in a support role. We also note that the threat posed by al-Qaeda to the US persists: despite being substantially weakened by US counterterrorism efforts and attacks on its leadership over the past decade, elements the group and its affiliates have proven resilient - particularly the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula branch. Al-Qaeda may strengthen and expand further over the coming years, and may also seek to carry out large-scale attacks on US targets or US soil. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 36 United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Company Overview Boeing is the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, jetliners and military aircraft. Military aircraft technology includes advanced systems for surveillance and reconnaissance, airborne antisubmarine warfare and intelligence, global strike systems, and guided missiles. Missile defence products include the Ground-Based Midcourse Defence system. Boeing's five main business areas are: commercial airplanes, defence, space and security , financial services, in-flight entertainment and air traffic management. However, 99% of Boeing's revenues originate from the first two areas: commercial airplanes and integrated defence systems . Boeing's Defence, Space and Security operations engage research, development production, modification and support of products and related systems. The main customer is the US Department of Defense , NASA, international defence markets, civil markets and commercial satellite markets. Boeing has offices in a wide range of overseas destinations, including: Australia, France, Italy, South Korea, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Spain, Canada, India, Israel, Turkey, China, Russia, the UK and the Middle East. Boeing Defence, Space and Security international operations include Boeing Defence U.K. Ltd., Boeing Defence Australia, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Aviation Training International Ltd and Boeing Sikorsky International Services LLC. Boeing Defence Space and Security faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics. Non-US companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the US market by reinforcing their US operations and partnering with US defence companies. Moreover, some competitors have irregularly formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. We expect that this strong competition trend will continue in the coming years. Strategy Boeing struggled through the 2008-2009 recession, facing lower demand for civilian freighters and passenger aircraft. Like the rest of the defence industry, Boeing needs international markets as it faces multiple challenges in the domestic US defence sector. The company faces stiff competition from Lockheed Martin and Airbus, which are also making inroads into emerging markets, notably India. Boeing expects to generate about half its total international defence revenue from the Middle East over the next five years as it continues to reposition itself to win overseas contracts amid slowing defence spending growth. Brazil is also a key defence market Business Monitor International Ltd Page 37 Company Profile Boeing United States Defence & Security Report 2016 for Boeing, with its local unit there reporting some of the fastest growth across the company. Asia is likely to grow as a defence market for Boeing in future, in line with the broader US government's 'pivot' towards the region.

Through the abovementioned subsidiary, Lockheed Martin has offices in a range of countries across the world, including: Australia, Canada , Germany, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Turkey, the and the UAE. Lockheed Martin's primary customer is the US government. The sales proportions are: 57% US Department of Defense, 20% NASA & Other Government Agencies, 6% US commercial and 17% International Sales. Strategy Lockheed Martin's business strategy is to hold a product and technology portfolio alongside original investments that are aligned with the extreme challenges that its global customers face today. A wide range of products and latest-high-technology offerings have allowed them to stay ahead of the game. That said, Lockheed Martin has seen relatively flat revenue growth in recent years. This is explained by the substantial defence spending cuts implemented by the US government. Given the reduced domestic demand for its products, the company has focused increasingly on foreign sales. We expect Lockheed Martin's exports to continue to grow over coming years as a result of strengthening international trade ties. We also forecast healthier US defence spending growth under the new president. Consequently, we see opportunities for significant revenue growth by the company in the next decade. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 41 Lockheed Martin United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Products The star product for Lockheed Martin is its Joint Strike Fighter programme. This is a joint development between nine countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. Lockheed Martin develops the majority of the systems. LONGBOW system is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The LONGBOW Fire Control Radar rapidly and automatically searches, detects, locates, classifies, and prioritises multiple moving and stationary targets on land, water and in the air in all weather and battlefield conditions from standoff ranges. Other products include: C-5, C- 130 Hercules, L 100, L 382, C 141, F 16, F 22, P3 Orion, L 188, S3, F50 trainer jet, PAC- 3, Multiple Launch Rocket System . Other initiatives developed by Lockheed Martin include: Fixed Wing Sensors, Army Tactical Missile System , Hellfire II Missile, Vessel Traffic Management Information System , Vessel Traffic Management Information System , Sharpshooter Targeting Pods and Pathfinder Navigation Pods, Radars, C4ISR and Command and Control Capabilities, C4ISR and Command and Control Capabilities.

The firm has accrued significant experience in the aerospace sector, providing complete platforms along with major subsystems. In recent years, the company has also deepened its expertise in the field of land systems, along with enlarging its civilian business. Northrop Grumman manufactures systems and products in the aerospace, electronics, information systems, shipbuilding and technical services segments. Northrop merged with Grumman in 1994. This was to bring about economies of scale in the face of rapidly rising research and development costs of high-tech weapons systems, the demand for which has largely overtaken previous Cold War needs for military equipment. Northrop Gunman has six business sections: Electronic Systems, Information Technology, Integrated Systems, Ship Systems, Newport News and Component Technologies. The biggest portion of Northrop's revenue derives from the Electronic Systems and Information Technology segments. Northrop Gunman has a strong global presence, with corporate offices in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Australia, South Korea and Japan. Northrop Grumman also sustains a network of regional offices in Europe and in Singapore, Taipei and New Delhi. Strategy According to its website, 'as a primary international security corporation, NorthropGrumman is dedicated to perform at the vanguard of technology and innovation, delivering higher capabilities in the best cost efficient manner'. The company is working to strengthen its presence on the global market, and 'reinforce its international partnerships'. It is focusing particularly on the Asia region - a trend we expect to continue in coming years, in line with the broader US foreign policy direction. Products Some of the company's products include: B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, F-14 Tomcat,E-8C Joint STARS surveillance aircraft, RQ-4 Global Hawk, T-38 Talon supersonic trainer, RQ-5 Hunter unmanned air vehicle, BQM-74, RQ-4 BAMS UAS, C-2 Greyhound, E-2 Hawkeye, EA-6B Prowler, AMASS, AN/APG-68 radar, the AN/APG-80 control radar Advanced Electronically Scanned Array , Scalable Agile Beam Radar , AN/APG-77 AESA radar, AN/APG-81 AESA radar, AN/AAQ-37 electro-optical Distributed Aperture System and the APQ-164 Passive Electronically Scanned Array radar.

The precise form of model we use varies from industry to industry, in each case determined, as per standard practice, by the prevailing features of the industry data being examined. Common to our analysis of every industry is the use of vector autoregressions. These allow us to forecast a variable using more than the variable's own history as explanatory information. For example, when forecasting oil prices, we can include information about oil consumption, supply and capacity. When forecasting for some of our industry sub-component variables, however, using a variable's own history is often the most desirable method of analysis. Such single-variable analysis is called univariate modelling. We use the most common and versatile form of univariate models: the autoregressive moving average model . In some cases, ARMA techniques are inappropriate because there is insufficient historic data or data quality is poor. In such cases, we use either traditional decomposition methods or smoothing methods as a basis for analysis and forecasting. BMI mainly uses OLS estimators and in order to avoid relying on subjective views and encourage the use of objective views, we use a 'general-to-specific' method. BMI mainly uses a linear model, but simple nonlinear models, such as the log-linear model, are used when necessary. During periods of 'industry shock', for example poor weather conditions that affect agricultural output, dummy variables are used to determine the level of impact. Effective forecasting depends on appropriately selected regression models. We select the best model according to various different criteria and tests, including but not exclusive to: R2 tests explanatory power; adjusted R2 takes degree of freedom into account; Testing the directional movement and magnitude of coefficients; Hypothesis testing to ensure coefficients are significant ; All results are assessed to alleviate issues related to auto-correlation and multi-collinearity. BMI uses the selected best model to perform forecasting. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 46 Methodology Industry Forecast Methodology United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Human intervention plays a necessary and desirable role in all of our industry forecasting. Experience, expertise and knowledge of industry data and trends ensure that analysts spot structural breaks, anomalous data, turning points and seasonal features where a purely mechanical forecasting process would not. Sector-Specific Methodology Our Defence is forecasted by assessing the combination of historic and projected defence expenditure or military budgets passed by governments. Based on our assessments we then forecast defence expenditure as a % of GDP, taking into consideration other wider fiscal and country macro-economic factors. Our manpower calculations are based on population projections from the World Bank and UN, and, defence imports and exports are based on the general trade outlook of the country. Human intervention may play a necessary role, for example where there has been an; outbreak of war, civil conflict and external threats etc. This can all change the scope of the defence budgets dramatically and can only be factored in by our analyst's expertise. In addition, our analysts also take into consideration general macro-economic and industry factors when intervening, bringing together our country risk and industry knowledge to give a complete forecast of the industry. BMI's Risk Reward Index provide a comparative regional ranking system evaluating the ease of doing business and the industry-specific opportunities and limitations for potential investors in a given market. The RRI system divides into two distinct areas: Rewards: Evaluation of sector's size and growth potential in each state, and also broader industry/state characteristics that may inhibit its development. This is further broken down into two sub categories: Market Rewards: This is an industry specific category taking into account current industry size and growth forecasts, the openness of market to new entrants and foreign investors, to provide an overall score for potential returns for investors. Country Rewards: Tthis is a country specific category, and the score factors in favourable political and economic conditions for the industry. Business Monitor International Ltd Page 47 Risk/Reward Index Methodology United States Defence & Security Report 2016 Risks: Evaluation of industry-specific dangers and those emanating from the state's political/economic profile that call into question the likelihood of anticipated returns being realised over the assessed time period. This is further broken down into two sub categories: Market Risks: This is an industry specific category whose score covers potential operational risks to investors, regulatory issues inhibiting the industry, and the relative maturity of a market. Country Risks: This is a country specific category in which political and economic instability, unfavourable legislation and a poor overall business environment are evaluated to provide an overall score. We take a weighted average, combining market and country risks, or market and country rewards. These two results in turn provide an overall RRI score, which is used to create our regional ranking system for the risks and rewards of involvement in a specific industry in a particular country. For each category and sub-category, each state is scored out of 100 , with the overall Risk Reward Index a weighted average of the total score. Importantly, as most of the countries and territories evaluated are considered by BMI to be Emerging Markets, our index is revised on a quarterly basis. This ensures that the index draws on the latest information and data across our broad range of sources, and the expertise of our analysts. BMI's approach in assessing the risk/reward balance for industry investors globally is fourfold: First, we identify factors (in terms of current industry/country trends and forecast industry/country growth) that represent opportunities to would-be investors. Second, we identify country and industry-specific traits that pose or could pose operational risks to would-be investors. Third, we attempt, where possible, to identify objective indicators that may serve as proxies for issues/ trends to avoid subjectivity. Finally, we use BMI's proprietary Operational Risk Index in a nuanced manner to ensure that only the aspects most relevant to the infrastructure industry are incorporated. Overall, the system offers an industry-leading, comparative insight into the opportunities/risks for companies across the globe.

0db43f37-5f31-4692-9b09-56a75ad5f687,"In his magisterial new analysis of Russian foreign policy under President Vladimir Putin, Russia and the New World Disorder, Chatham House fellow Bobo Lo argues that the Kremlin's understanding of the current international environment is almost Marxist-Leninist in its teleological underpinnings. While in Soviet times Moscow's ideology foresaw the inevitable triumph of socialism led by the USSR, Lo describes Russia's current focus on the inevitable decline of the West and the triumph of a non-Western multipolar order in which Russia will play a key role. Lo believes that this ideologically tinged version of geopolitics leaves Putin poorly equipped to deal with complex global realities. Although Putin has scored tactical victories against U.S. president Barack Obama and other Western ""opponents"" through his quick and flexible actions in Ukraine and Syria, Lo argues that Putin's strategic vision is in contrast inflexible, flawed, and ultimately doomed to send Russia even further into relative decline because of its transparently instrumentalist cast. Most importantly, Lo observes that the Kremlin's neo-imperial image of Russia's proper role in the post-Soviet space will undermine its relationships in Eurasia. Russia and the New World Disorder is comprehensive in scope, dealing with everything from foreign policy decision-making to a review of the most pressing issues in the current international environment. It includes sections on Russia's views of international governance and what Lo sees as Russia's ""imperial spirit"" , as well as a broad overview of Russia's recent relationships with both the East and the West. Lo's 2008 book, Axis of Convenience: Moscow, Beijing, and the New Geopolitics, focused on Russia's developing relationship with China, and many of his earlier observations on Russia's eastward turn are reprised and updated in this new volume. The new book 's significant sections on Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region are particularly welcome in an academic environment that often privileges analysis of Russia's relations with the West. Lo's discussion of how Russia defines ""Asianness"" is useful , as is his observation that Russia's Asia policy seems unduly centered on China. Lo also pays significant attention to the potential future trajectories of Russian foreign policy. Chapter eight lays out four scenarios for Russia's foreign policy development by the year 2030, based on differing predictions about the direction of Russia's domestic political evolution. One weakness of this section is that the scenarios are presented without any sense of the political incentives and realities that would drive them-and without attention to the myth-making philosophy of Putinism that Lo explores so well in the earlier sections of the book. He portrays a turn to ""second-wave liberalism"" as equally likely to develop as ""hard authoritarianism"" without much explanation of the changes needed to achieve a more liberal outcome from where Russia is today. In chapter two, ""The Domestic Context of Foreign Policy,"" Lo deftly shows how the Kremlin's foreign policy has matched and reinforced the historical myths and resulting perceived interests held by much of the Russian elite and mass public. As Lo writes, ""the stars are not aligned in favor of change"" , so it is not clear what would drive such a liberal shift. In a departure from standard academic practice, Lo also includes a chapter that prescribes not only what the West should do toward Russia but also what Russia should do to reform its own foreign policy. While it is unlikely that Putin will pay attention, Lo's logic is convincing. The very comprehensiveness of the book, by definition, forces a certain superficiality of analysis. For example, Lo argues that the ideas of the late Yevgenii Primakov, who served as director of foreign intelligence, foreign minister, and eventually prime minister under former president Boris Yeltsin, have ""underpinned much of Putin's pursuit of a multipolar order"" and have ""actually become more influential in recent years"" . In a related footnote , Lo dismisses the influence of the geo-ethnic ideas of Alexander Dugin and his neo-Eurasianist philosophy: the notion that Russians have a foreordained role to lead the eastern and central sections of the Eurasian continent because that is what both geography and the natural divisions of culture demandBut while the book notes Primakov's role as the engine behind Russian conversations about multipolarity starting in the 1990s and his unfailing advocacy for putting constraints on U.S. primacy , Primakov also signed the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act and rose from what turned out to be almost his deathbed in January 2015 to publicly argue that Russia's foreign policy direction and lack of economic diversification put it in danger of self-isolationIn that 2015 speech, Primakov urged the Kremlin to open the door to cooperation with the West both on economic issues and on jointly solving the world's most important security problems. Primakov's statements-that Russia need not fear a ""color revolution,"" that the Donbas should be recognized as Ukrainian territory, and that Russian troops should never be sent to help rebel militias there-indeed implied that Ukraine was far from the worst security problem facing RussiaIn other words, the most critical set of foreign policy decisions undertaken by Putin since entering the presidency in 2000-those surrounding military actions toward Ukraine-do not appear to have been due to Primakov's influence. They instead have more than a whiff of Duginism about them. Despite these small quibbles with its conclusions, this book will certainly leave an important mark. Lo is one of the world's leading experts on Russian foreign policy, and his insights about the internal contradictions and ultimate weaknesses of Putin's choices have value for any serious scholar or policy analyst. Then, too, the very comprehensiveness of the book, as well as its fluid prose, will make it an excellent text for an advanced undergraduate or master's level course on Russian foreign policy."
b19066af-d84b-4f74-8704-cd80ee7e8562,"The Russian government says it has sent troops to fight alongside Kurdish units in northwestern Syria and is providing weapons to Iraqi Kurds, in a tactic that could upstage a long-standing U.S. alliance with the stateless ethnic group and increase Moscow's influence in the region. Russian and Kurdish officials say the Kremlin intends to keep a foothold in the area by cultivating ties with some Kurdish groups through weapons, ammunition and oil deals, building on its presence established through its relationship with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's regime. Russia's support appears to be focused on one group in western Syria, the Afrin Kurds, an American defense official said. The Afrin Kurds haven't been backed by the U.S., which has supported an umbrella group of Syrian Kurdish fighters, known as the People's Defense Units, or YPG. The U.S. relies on Kurdish militants in Syria as one of its most effective allies in the fight against Islamic State. That support has angered Turkey, which sees the YPG as a threat for its close ties with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The PKK is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., Turkey and the European Union. The Kremlin's maneuver comes amid U.S. concerns that Russia is redeploying troops and weapons in Syria in preparation for a return to full-scale fighting. Russia President Vladimir Putin last week said Russian soldiers have been fighting alongside Syrian Kurds around the strategic battleground of Aleppo, although American intelligence officials questioned whether those troops were on the front lines. The American officials said Mr. Putin's announcement was likely a provocation against the U.S. and Turkey. Russia maintains two bases in Syria, and an unknown number of troops and aircraft, and officials say the country's forces still provide some air support and targeting information on the ground to allies there. Russia and the U.S. are also both supporting Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State in Iraq. The Pentagon said Monday it would be increasing its presence in Iraq and providing an additional $415 million in aid to the Iraqi Kurdish fighters, known as Peshmerga. The U.S. currently has an advising and training mission with the Peshmerga and occasionally partners with them on special-operations missions, according to Col. Steve Warren, spokesman for the Pentagon in Iraq. Russian officials have disclosed recently that they are supplying more weapons to Iraqi Kurds as that group prepares to step up its fight against Islamic State and help in the eventual battle for Mosul. The Pentagon remains unruffled by Russian overtures to the Kurds in Iraq and isn't scrambling to counter them, Col. ""The Russians have been selling arms to various players in Iraq for 50 years,"" he said. Mark Katz, a professor at George Mason University who focuses on Russian foreign-policy affairs, said, however, that Moscow's move might goad the Americans into stepping up arms supplies to prevent Russia from gaining the upper hand. ""Even if the U.S. hasn't been forthcoming,"" Mr. Katz said, ""maybe a little competition from Russia can get the U.S. to do so."" Russian outreach to the Kurds follows friction with Turkey. After Turkey downed a Russian Su-24 warplane late last year, Russia quickly pressed Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to demand Kurdish participation in Syrian peace talks, a move seen as a direct swipe at Ankara. Before Russia's intervention, the Kurds had no champion and no substantial claim to be part of the peace talks. Last month, Mr. Erdogan warned Russia it was risking its own security by aligning itself with the Syrian Kurds. Turkey is embroiled in a multifront battle with the PKK and Ankara has watched with alarm as the U.S. has deepened its ties with the group's Syrian affiliate. In political circles, Russia's outreach to Kurds in Iraq is raising concern about more tension between Moscow and Washington. ""Russia will take on any opportunity it can to undermine U.S. interests globally, but they don't always think through the consequences,"" said Rep. Seth Moulton , a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Russian officials say their most recent arms package to the Iraqi Kurds arrived in mid-March. Another delivery of more advanced weapons is expected in May. The arms deliveries are a potentially sensitive point for the Iraqi government. The Kurdish Regional Government in Erbil enjoys a high degree of autonomy, but controlling arms distribution has been a key way for Baghdad to keep the Kurds tied to the federal government.

40e8945d-4140-43a7-a405-cc45eda10981,"Submitted by Darius Sahtahmasebi via TheAntiMedia.org, As Russia and the United States approach arguably the most dangerous crossroads in history -- and as Western media continues to crucify Russia for its actions within Syria -- a closer look at the rationale Putin used for intervening in the Syrian war paints a sane explanation of how we ended up at this juncture of a global conflict. Unsurprisingly, the explanation comes from the Russian president himself and was actually offered over 3 years ago. As expected, the Western corporate media and the Obama administration chose to ignore Vladimir Putin's explanation for Russia's stance on Syria and continued a number of policies that have completely exacerbated the conflict. In a live interview with RT in June 2013, Putin was asked for an explanation regarding Russia's support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, even though this support has made some people very angry at Russia. Putin's response was that Russia does not support the Assad government or Assad himself, but before defining Russia's official position, he explained what Russia does not want to do within Syria or across the Middle East: However, according to Putin, what worries Russia can be identified by having a look "" at what is going on in the Middle East in general ."" In Putin's eyes, these events are no accident. As he puts it, these events happened for a reason: "" Some people, from the outside, think that if they can 'comb' the region to how they see fit - some of them call this 'democracy' - then the region will come into calmness and order. That's not how it is. Without taking into account the history, the traditions, religious particularities, you must not do anything in the Middle East, especially as an outsider."" Play Video Russia found this out the hard way when its military intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s, a war many historians believe to be one of the main reasons for the fall of the Soviet empire. According to Robert Gates, director of the CIA under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and Secretary of Defense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the U.S. began arming and funding jihadists in Pakistan and Afghanistan six months prior to the Soviet invasion with the express goal of luring the Soviets into a quagmire. Similarly, and not by accident, the tactic used to draw Russia into Afghanistan is the same tactic being used today in Syria. In fact, Obama warned Putin that Russia's adventures into Syria would result in the same quagmire the Soviets met in Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly, supporting radical militant groups to overthrow regimes in the Middle East has been a key hallmark of Obama's foreign policy. As Putin notes: ""So they interfered in the internal affairs of Libya. Whether the regime was good or bad - but Libya used to have the highest standard of living in the Middle East. And what's happening there now? There's a war for resources; an endless inter-tribal war. How is this all going to end - nobody knows."" What happened to Libya resonated strongly with Russia due to the fact that in that situation, the West convinced Russia and China not to use their veto power at the U.N. Security Council level -- they were told regime change was not part of NATO's agenda in Libya. As it turned out, however, this was one of the first things that happened as soon as authorization was granted for NATO to bomb Libyan territory. Putin immediately questioned why NATO was attacking Muammar Gaddafi directly despite their promises they would not do so. Putin has therefore drawn the following conclusion: The role of al-Nusra in the Syrian conflict continues to be the main issue today, as Russia has repeatedly asked for the United States to differentiate between terrorist groups and moderate groups on the ground in Syria. As Putin said: ""Or, here's another example. They support certain organizations that are fighting against Assad in Syria, yet those same countries fight against these organizations in Mali."" Putin's reference to fighters in Mali is a direct attack on France's role in the war on terror. France has been actively bombing Mali since 2013, though this is rarely covered by the mainstream media. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has noted, the fighters France supported in Libya to overthrow Gaddafi were the same fighters they have supposedly been fighting in Mali. "" Often, not only are they the same organizations - they are the same individuals ,"" Putin added. ""They simply leave Syria and go to fight in Mali - where western states do not support them. Then the same people go back to Syria and there they are supported.""

2a5815c8-1a7d-48f0-a0f8-9e196e78f4f6,"ABSTRACT History of relations between Russia and Turkey falls under the category of the most problematic bilateral international contacts. Relations between the two countries, daring back to the times of the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, are teeming with disputes, conflicts and incessant urge to pursue conflicting interests. Efforts were made to solve those by way of diplomacy, but unfortunately force was also very often used as the tool of resolution. The mutual dislike of the two powers dates back to the sixteenth century, which is when the first Russo-Turkish war took place . From then on until the 21st century, no century passed without an armed conflict between the two countries. Also in this century, dangerous incidents blot the mutual relations that could ultimately lead to a military outburst - on a scale larger than the local one. The eternal desire to dominate pervading each of these countries, simultaneously in two regions: the Balkans and Central and Eastern Asia, often made also the Western powers engage in the emerging conflicts. It is just the same today. Middle East regions, including Transcaucasia, and South-eastern Europe are the proverbial ""powder kegs."" For many years, the northern areas of Iraq and Syria are at war with the so-called ""Islamic State."" Both Russia and Turkey are directly involved in this conflict. Also France, Britain and the United States have been implicated in the military intervention. After several years of mutual hostilities between Ankara and Moscow, a surprising ground-breaking shift took place in mutual relations. In August 2016, presidents of Turkey and Russia unexpectedly met in St. Petersburg. International media report that a new power structure is emerging in the geopolitical context. The entire situation is all the more surprising as we are witnessing a difficult agreement between seemingly eternal rivals, if not enemies. So what prompted the two regional powers to develop closer ties and make efforts to bring their relations into line? It seems that the shift was prompted by pragmatic political and economic considerations, that may be identified, and then rationally analysed. Keywords: policy, region, Russia, situation, Turkey 1.INTRODUCTION It might be considered that the century-spanning mutual relations between Turkey and Russia usually have not been the easiest. Longer periods of cooperation and peace between the two nations have been extremely rare. The reason for that was the incessant rivalry between the two powers for areas of influence in South East Europe and Central Asia. The state of affairs was further complicated by fundamental religious differences between Turkey and Russia. Turkey, then still known as the Ottoman Empire, aimed at supremacy of all Muslims. Moscow, on the other hand, aspired to become the centre of Easter Christian tradition. After the Turks captured Constantinople , Moscow wanted to gain importance as the only successor of the Byzantine Empire. This ambition was emphasised by the marriage concluded in 1472 by Ivan III the Great with Sophia Paleologue , niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantin XI Dragases . An event of great symbolic importance was assuming the double-headed Byzantine eagle as the coat-of-arms of the entire Ruthenian country and introducing etiquette taken directly from Eastern Roman Empire at the court of the tsars. Following the fall of the First Rome in the West , and the fall of Byzantium in the East almost one thousand years later, Moscow was supposed to become the Third Rome . In turn, after seizing Constantinople Turkish rulers initially assumed the title of ""Roman Emperor"". Closer to the end of the Ottoman Empire, however, they preferred to add the title of Caliphs - Muhammad's successors - to that of sultan. Nowadays, leaders of both countries, not without a reason, are often compared to those rulers. The press often calls the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, the new tsar. The President of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is just as frequently referred to as the contemporary sultan. Such comparisons serve very well to illustrate political ambitions and enormous power wielded by both leaders as of now. As their main goal, both Putin a nd Erdogan committed themselves to reclaiming power in the traditional areas of influence and earning respect for their countries internationally. In both one and the other country, the actions of the presidents won them tens of millions of zealous followers and uncritical support of the majority of the society. Yet again, just as many times in the past, this led to a conflict of interests between Ankara and Moscow. The ever-present animosity has been growing in the past few years due to the dramatic events in the Middle East and the former Soviet republics in the Caucasus. The already very strained situation culminated on 24 November 2015, when a Russian Su-24 bomber was shot down on its way back from a mission against ISIS by a Turkish F-16 fighter. According to official Turkish sources, the reason for the shootdown was the Russian aircraft violating the airspace of the Republic of Turkey near the Syrian border . Pierre Sprey, American defence specialist and a former Pentagon employee, claimed in an interview for the American Harper's Magazine that: ""the evidence looks pretty strong that the Turks were setting up an ambush"". Soon, more incidents involving Russia and Turkey followed. In early December 2015, Turkey reacted strongly to the fact that a serviceman on the deck of a Russian warship passing through Bosporus was seen holding a rocket launcher. A few days later, on the Aegean Sea, a Russian ship fired warning shots at an approaching Turkish fishing boat, which allegedly did not react to calls to divert its course. According to Moscow it was a provocation, and Turkey had earlier accused Russia of the same . The escalation of adversary acts posed a threat mainly due to the fact that Turkey is one of main pillars of NATO, and Russia is a global military power with nuclear weapons. Both countries were at the verge of an open armed conflict with unpredictable potential effects on a global scale. After several months of mutual aggression in the media, there was a sudden and completely unforeseen turn in the relations between the two countries. In August 2016, Recep Tayyip Erdogan came with an unexpected visit to Russia. Meeting of the Presidents of Russia and Turkey in the Constantine Palace in Strelna near Saint Petersburg The Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the visit of the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Russia indicated both leaders' willingness to: ""resume the dialogue and relations between Russia and Turkey"" after nine months of diplomatic crisis. Turkish press provided more details, reporting that reconciliation with Russia was possible thanks to previous secret negotiations at the highest level in Tashkent. Erdogan, on the other hand, announced that collaboration with Russia would help solving problems in the region. According to the Turkish President, actions taken together with Russia would lead to a new chapter in the relations between Ankara and Moscow, completely different than ever before. Additionally, President Erdogan officially apologised to Russia and to the family of the killed Su-24 pilot. Russia's answer was to lift all its sanctions against Turkey . A few days after the meeting, separatists in Donbass resumed their aggressive military campaign against Ukraine, whereas Turkish forces entered northern Syria and opened intensive fire at positions held by the Islamic State. Judging from these events, one may conclude that the arrangements made in Saint Petersburg had a much broader scope than what was officially announced in communications of both parties to the negotiations. It can be assumed that the two powers have now moved on to definitive solutions in issues relevant to them, under secret agreements concluded in August 2016. 2.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN TURKEY AND RUSSIA In principle, the conflict of interests between Turkey and Russia has been present since the beginning of the two states, namely the capture of Constantinople by the Ottomans. The Ottoman Empire, growing in strength, at first discreetly, and then completely openly began to provide support for smaller Islamic vassal states in Russia, such as the Astrakhan Khanate and the Crimean Khanate. This led to a series of ten exhausting wars between the two empires. They broke out almost cyclically from 1568 to 1878. It was one of the longest series of military conflicts in European history. The struggle intensified even further when the country of the tsars captured its first outpost at the Black Sea, which until then had been an internal sea of the Ottoman Empire. For almost half a century Russian military and diplomats were not able to ensure free transport on the Black Sea. Even later free access to its waters was severely limited, because as late as in the second half of the 19th century the Ottoman fleet was still much larger and more modern than its Russian counterpart . By the 19th century, Russia was helping Turkey's Slavic and Christian minorities to revolt against Ottoman rule. The result was an exceptionally bloody armed conflict in the years 1877- 1878, called the ""Tenth Russo-Turkish War."" With time, the Russian proved to be dominant in the struggle. After the victory in the Battle of Aladzha , the Turks were defeated and forced to retreat in the Caucasus. It was much worse was on the Balkan front. In January 1878, the Russian army, at the time approximately 315,000 men strong, was time after time successful fighting against the 180 thousands soldiers of the Turkish army. On the 4th of January 1878, tsar's troops took Sofia, on January the 9 Shipka-Sheinova, on January the 17 Filipopol, and on January the 29 they were victorious at Adrianople. As a result of this campaign, the Russians were at a distance of approximately 40 kilometres from the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The age-old dream of the tsars to return Constantinople to the Eastern Church and making it the capital of Russia was about to come true. And, probably, this is what would have happened, if it hadn't been for the intervention of the united Western countries concerned about the increase in the power of the Romanovs. Combined diplomatic efforts of Great Britain, France and Austro-Hungary put a stop to the further victorious march of the Russians. Plan for a possible mobilization of the army and the British fleet of battleships in Marmara Sea forced Petersburg to refrain from taking Constantinople and conquering the entire Turkey . The last serious conflict between Russia and Turkey took place in the early 20th century. The Ottoman Empire waited until November 1914 to join the war which had broke out it Europe in July. In World War I Turkey took the side of the Central Powers, that is two empires: Germany under the rule of Wilhelm II Hohenzollern and AustriaHungary under Franz Joseph I Habsburg, and their ally, Bulgaria under the rule of Ferdinand I Coburg. Their opponents were the countries of the Entente, namely Great Britain, France, Russia, Serbia, Japan, Italy , Greece , and the United States . Turkey took on itself the fight against the Russian Empire. The main arena of struggle between Russia and Turkey was Transcaucasia. The civil war which devoured the Romanov empire in 1917 allowed the Turks to reclaim a part of the lands that had been lost to Russia. Russian forces left positions in the Caucasian front in early 1918. On 3 March 1918, the government of the new, Bolshevik Russia signed the peace treaty in Brest, which formally ended the war with the Ottoman Empire. The legendary leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, leading a national movement, brought about the fall of the sultanate. The objective of his policy was to reclaim at least a part of territories taken from his country after World War I. In Autumn 1920, Turkey and Soviet Russia, under the Treaty of Mutual Friendship and Cooperation, committed an act of aggression against the sovereign and independent Armenia. Turkey took in most if its territory, whereas the Bolsheviks annexed the rest into the Soviet Union. On this example, history shows us that two states, feuding for centuries over fundamental issues, managed to reach an agreement despite the many differences and prejudice. This happened for the first time on such a large scale almost one hundred years ago. 3.COMMON GOALS OF ANKARA AND MOSCOW There are many factors which as a result lead to a conflict of pursued objectives and interests between the two countries. However, one cannot but note the convergence of views and actions of Ankara and Moscow concerning many important issues. When faced with dynamic changes in today's world, these issues have lately gained significance. The most important in clude: attitude towards the North Atlantic Treaty, growing problems in contacts with the European Union, current and future benefits of economic cooperation. It seems that in the case of both the Republic of Turkey and the Russian Federation, the vision of potential profits is beginning to outweigh the old, inveterate prejudice. Such an attitude remodels completely the balance of power and architecture of existing political structures in key regions of our world and in general internationally. 3ATTITUDE TOWARDS NATO It may seem like a paradox, but apparently at the moment neither Turkey, nor Russia is satisfied with the concept of NATO functioning in its current shape. Authorities in Moscow consider the very existence of this military pact to be an instrument aimed straight at the heart of ""Mother Russia"". It is worth remembering that in their naivety, on 31 March 1954 the USSR, Belarus and Ukraine at the same time applied for membership in NATO - as three sovereign states. The USSR authorities seriously considered giving up the policy of confrontational against the western world and joining NATO. The leaders of the Alliance, however, formulated five conditions that the USSR needed to fulfil in order to become a member of the organisation. Most of them were unacceptable to Moscow. The conditions were the following: * Independence for Austria. * Peaceful reunification of Germany. * Signing of the general disarmament treaty. * Restitution of disputed territories in the Far East to Japan. * Recognition of the fundamental principles of the Statute of the United Nations. The responses received by the USSR, Belarus and Ukraine, were in all cases the same - unambiguously negative. After the death of Stalin, the USSR authorities decided to make efforts again to improve the relations with the West. But it was too late: by that time, a gargantuan military-industrial complex had been created in the US, starting to play an independent political role in the country. Instead of Soviet Russia, it was the Federal Republic of Germany that was admitted to the North Atlantic Treaty. The reaction of the USSR and seven Eastern European satellite countries was to create, as a counterweight to the threat from the West, the Warsaw Pact . Turkey, as a member of NATO since 1952, for several decades faithfully served the interests of the United States in the regions of the Balkans, the Black Sea, and Middle East. The resulting cooperation of subsequent factions holding power in Ankara with the Capitol and the White House effectively prevented any tighter relations with Moscow. The US and NATO had controlled Erdogan's endeavours for many years, until he suddenly started to seek independence. He may have become aware of the fact that further blind support for the West would bring nothing good in the long term. The coincidence in time between the turn in the policy of the Turkish president and the attempted military coup is rather striking. Some commentators consider mass arrests of Turkish officers of the Incirlik base to be evidence for the US being complicit in the coup attempt. The faction responsible for the putsch openly admitted to having received aid from the NATO base . This means that the authorities of both Turkey and Russia have justified reasons to distrust those who control the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty from Washington. 3THE EUROPEAN UNION PROBLEM In the case of Russia's and Turkey's relations with the European Union, one cannot but notice the obvious reluctance of the Community leaders to open their door for the two countries. Following many years of ineffective efforts to join the family of European nations, both the President of the Republic of Turkey - Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the President of the Russian Federation - Vladimir Putin, gave up on their attempts of integration with and accession to the EU. Moreover, it seems that today both leaders are more interested in damaging the interests of the Union, or even causing it to break apart, than in establishing relations that would be beneficial to all parties. Modern Turkey has since long been knocking at the door of the West in the Old Continent, personified by the European Union. As early as in 1963, the then European Economic Community granted Turkey the status of an associate member. On the 14th of April 1987, Ankara filed an official application which formally started the negotiation process regarding the accession to the European Union. The 1997 Luxembourg Summit blocked the way to the EU for Turkey. The opposition of Greece was decisive in the matter. However, the European Council summit in Helsinki in 1999 revoked the previous decision and recognised Turkey as an official accession candidate. Turkish negotiations with the European Union started on the 3rd of October 2005. The main obstacle to membership is still the Cyprus issue. Turkey undertook to extend the customs union to all new EU members. However, it refused it to Cyprus, as it does not recognise that state. This froze the accession procedure for many long years. The situation saw a dramatic change as refugees from the Middle East started to flood Europe . Millions of illegal immigrants threatened the stability of the EU. Then it turned out that the only hope in the difficult situation laid with Turkey, which agreed to receive unwanted newcomers on its territory in exchange for an aid of EUR 6 billion, acceleration of the accession process and granting all citizens of Turkey entry visas by mid2016. A failed military coup and the repressions that followed quenched the aspirations of Ankara to join the integration group. Implications of failure to respect the rule of law, introduction of a state of emergency in the country, closing opposition newspapers, radio and television stations, thousands of arrested people, purges in the army and a plan for restoring the death penalty led to the German government stating, through its spokesman Steffan Seibert, that: ""in the current political situation, it considers unthinkable to open new chapters in negotiations with Ankara on Turkey 's accession to the EU"". Also the procedure to grant entry visas to the EU to citizens of Turkey was suspended. Once again, Turkey was removed from the group of European nations. However, in the case described above, the authorities in Berlin made a mistake by speaking so boldly on behalf of the entire Community. President Erdogan threatened that if the EU does not keep its promises, his country will no longer hinder the influx of immigrants to Europe. Germany, a self-proclaimed leader of the EU, and the heads of European states now, until October 2016, have the time to make up their minds, before the new ultimatum of Turkey regarding visas expires. Unfortunately, there are no good decisions at the moment. Either they will accept the Ankara's ultimatum and reveal their own weakness, or they will disagree and produce yet another wave of refugees in the Old Continent, which, in practice, will be the end of the European Union . Russia is the largest neighbour of the European Union. Prior to the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Federation was also one of the crucial economic partners of a large part of countries of the integration group. The key elements in trade between Russia and the EU have been, and still are, energy raw materials exported to the West, especially natural gas and oil. Food products and technically advanced industrial goods were sent in the opposite direction. One of the barriers that prevent Russia's accession to the European Union is its geographical situation. Over 75% of its area is in Asia, spreading over the area from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast in the Far East. However, according to the European Union authorities there are additional obstacles to full integration of Russia with the EU, namely: * Failure to respect human rights. * Deviating from democracy standards recognised within the United Europe. * Lawless annexation of Crimea. * Supporting separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. * Hostile policy towards the Baltic states and Georgia. * Poor economic development of vast areas east of Ural. * High level of nepotism. * Omnipresent corruption at highest level of State power and public administration. However it seems that the list of obstacles is not complete. It should also include a number of factors which, although significant, are rarely cited, such as: * Conflict with the ""old idea"" of Chancellor Bismarck: making Germany an economic empire spreading all the way from Western Europe to the whole of the eastern and northeastern coasts of the Black Sea and the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. * The possibility of the tandem France-Germany losing their de facto leadership in the European Union to Russia allied with Turkey. * Fear of millions Russian Federation citizens flooding the territory of the EU in search of work and better living conditions. * Losing of control over EU finance sector due to admitting capital-rich Russian banking institutions to the single market. * Establishment of a Russian area of influence in the Balkans and former Eastern European countries. * Losing the most important political and economic partner of today's European Union, that is the United States, due to the new circumstances. In the context of these facts, it does not come as a surprise that the EU authorities have maintained the economic sanctions imposed in Russia as early as in the summer of 2014. The decision to extend the restrictions until January 2017 was made in a summer 2016 meeting in Brussels. The restriction include, among others, impediments to access to capital for Russian state banks and oil companies, restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies for the oil industry and dual-use equipment, as well as an arms embargo. The prices of energy raw materials have been low for several years now. This is a serious problem for the Kremlin. Russian economy suffers from lack of incoming investment and access to western capitals. This has led to a painful slowdown, or even regression. Some experts predict that, if nothing changes, Russia has sufficient reserves for one year only. The Kremlin knows that it has one year to bring about a favourable change of some kind. The options are either for oil and gas to get more expensive, or a relaxation of relations with the West. Obviously, pulling out from Ukraine is beyond dispute, as it would be a catastrophe for the prestige of the government in Moscow . Nevertheless, there is one more possible scenario: polarising the attitudes of particular EU Member States towards Russia, while damaging the organisational structure of the group at the same time. This appears to be the very option that the Russian authorities are pursuing. There has been a split in the very bosom of the European Union. Some of its members strongly advocate further sanctions against Russia. These are the following: Czech Republic, Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Sweden and the UK. The harm of further tightening of sanctions is emphasised by : Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and through the mass media and unofficial non-governmental sources also France and Germany. Other countries belonging to the European Union openly express their doubts as to the validity of restrictions and they have not taken a clear common stance in relation to the existing situation. If we look closer at destabilisation of the existing EU structures, the first step on that path was taken in 2016, namely Brexit , and the possibilities of Frexit , Nexit , and Oexit have already been signalled. Even one of those countries leaving the Union would undermine the structure of the organisation as a whole . Recent proposals of the leaders of Italy and Germany, envisioning a Union limited to 7, or a maximum of 12 countries , lead to the conclusion that this is what an alternative future may look like. It should be emphasised that such a scenario is also in line with the objectives set by the Kremlin. RETURN OF TRUST BETWEEN ANKARA AND MOSCOW What comes as the biggest surprise is the sudden turn in the bilateral relations between Turkey and Russia as far as international politics is concerned, and unexpected warming of relations between the two countries following a de facto freezing of mutual relations. Undoubtedly, this radical change of course in mutual relations has been a result of events related in some way to the unsuccessful military coup which took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 of July 2016. The United States-Turkey relations have deteriorated drastically following the failed coup d'état. Turkish politicians and media openly accused the US of participating in the coup. The new military command showed their aversion to the US by cutting off the Incirlik base, where American forces are stationed, from all utilities, including electricity and water, for many long hours. The Americans no longer put enough trust Turkey to store their nuclear arsenal on its territory. According to sources close to NATO, the United States moved their nuclear weapon from Turkey to Romania - such sensational information was published by the Brusselsbased website Euractiv.com. Journalists from the portal report that the weapon was allegedly transported from the aforementioned Incirlik base in eastern Turkey to Deveselu in the southwest of Romania, near the border with Serbia and Bulgaria . The claim that the American military participated, with ample support of special services, in the coup attempt, is evidenced to a certain extent by arrests of tens of thousands of Turkish military personnel. It should be mentioned here that the Turkish army, and its command in particular, were a reliable ally within the NATO structures and the champion of US interests in the country on the Bosporus. It is unofficially known that it was the Russian services that warned Erdogan at the last moment of an impeding attack of the military. It is also said that Moscow provided Turkey with detailed information on many putschists and coup supporters . By saving Erdogan's life, the Russians gained the trust and lasting gratitude of the Turkish president. It is possible, however, that what finally convinced Erdogan to do a volte-face was a wish to improve the economic situation of his country and fear of Moscow mass-arming Kurdish separatists fighting for the independence of the territories they inhabit from Turkey. MUTUAL BENEFITS After a meeting of the leaders of both countries in August 2016 in Sankt Petersburg, all bilateral sanctions on import and export between Ankara and Moscow were lifted. The multi-million tourist traffic of Russians that, as before, have started again to spent their holidays in the many Turkish resorts on the coasts of the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Also work on the construction of the Turkish Stream pipeline intended to supply gas from Siberia to Turkey was resumed. The project is set to be launched in December 2016. The natural gas pipeline, a 1,090 kilometer long will run from Russia to Turkey, via the Black Sea. Talks to construct an offshoot to Greece have already begun. Today, plans for nuclear power are a key aspect of the Turkey' s aim for economic growth. Recent developments have seen Russia take a leading role in offering to finance and build 4800 MWe of nuclear capacity. Ankara has fulfilled all its promises regarding the Akkuyu - first nuclear power plant, the situation is developing very positively with a high level of confidence that the first nuclear power plant unit will be put into operation within the timeframe established by the contract with russian side. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a meeting in China's Hangzhou prior to the opening of the G20 summit. Both Russia and Turkey belong to the organisation bringing together twenty most developed countries in the world. Both countries have moved closer to the conclusion of an agreement on a free trade area . According to observers, it is already evident that Turkey, despite remaining in NATO, is drawing closer and closer to Moscow, and it is not out of question that it will want to join Russia's Eurasian Union. Therefore, the political and economic rapprochement of the two countries comes as no surprise. Having put the old feuds behind, they can now enjoy mutually beneficial cooperation. Ankara gains access to the unmeasurable natural riches of Russian Siberia. Moscow, in turn, successfully breaks the embargo of the US and he EU, and emerges from the long international isolation, bypassing the sanctions imposed on it. Turkey becomes a door that allows Russia's expansion into Middle East and North Africa . This is the most important door that Russia has been waiting for to open for several long centuries. 6.CONCLUSION The close cooperation between Ankara and Moscow after several years of feuds and disputes has fundamentally changed the architecture of relations in the Black Sea basin, Middle East and North Africa. It strengthens the position of both partners in this vast region. The alliance of Russia and Turkey has a growing influence over the future events in Western Europe, especially in the EU and, as regards NATO, on both sides of the Atlantic. This political and economic collaboration should soon bring about significant results for both powers. It comes as no surprise then that also other countries would like to gain certain quantifiable benefits from the unique dual structure created as a result of the above-mentioned dramatic events. It is beyond any doubt that the tightening and warming of relations between Ankara and Moscow will have a tremendous effect on international events in the time to come. The view has officially been expressed that a new strategic axis is being created: Ankara - Moscow - Tehran - Beijing, with a potential to change the current balance of power in the world. Until it is established, however, we will be watching the ruling elites of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkey with great interest."
dacc1c4b-8eec-46de-b8c1-0308eca75a1c,"WASHINGTON, D.C. Oct 10 - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have accused Russia of deliberately hacking e-mail servers of U.S. individuals and political organizations to interfere with the election campaign ongoing in the country. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,"" the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,"" the document says. ""Such activity is not new to Moscow - the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there,"" it says. ""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the statement says. It had been reported in July 2016 that the Democratic National Committee's e-mail servers had been hacked, causing a leak revealing that the committee, which is supposed to be neutral, in fact gave preference to Hillary Clinton rather than her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. The Clinton campaign insisted that the servers had been compromised by hackers presumably linked to Russia in the interests of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. U.S. media reported later that the FBI was investigating a possible attack on e-mail accounts belonging to The New York Times journalists. CNN reported with reference to U.S. officials familiar with the situation that hackers working for Russian intelligence services could have been behind the attacks. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Bloomberg in early September that the Russian government was unrelated to the hack attacks on the U.S. Democratic Party, which led to the publication of thousands of electronic documents. ""I would like to repeat: I know absolutely nothing about it, and Russia has never done anything like this at the State level,"" Putin said. The Russian leader said he was perplexed by the allegations that, through publishing some sensitive information, Russia wanted to influence the U.S. presidential elections. He suggested that, to do this, Russia had to thoroughly understand all nuances of U.S. politics, which it does not. ""It would require certain intuition and knowledge of the U.S. domestic policy peculiarities. I am not sure that even our experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have such intuition,"" he said. Talking about those who hacked into the Democratic National Committee servers, Putin doubted that these people could ever be identified. ""There are a lot of hackers today, you know, and they perform their work in such a filigreed and delicate manner and they can show their 'tracks' anywhere and anytime. It may not even be a track; they can cover their activity so that it looks like hackers operating from other territories, from other countries. It is hard to check this activity, maybe not even possible,"" Putin said. ""Anyway, we do not do that at the national level,"" he said."
fba9a1c4-cbef-4ce4-aca6-0fdf32c0417c,"Submitted by Darius Shahtahmasebi via TheAntiMedia.org, Renowned journalist Glenn Greenwald recently tweeted the three rules of American exceptionalism :3 rules of US Exceptionalism: 1) Our killing is better than theirs; 2) Nothing we do can be ""terrorism""; 3) Only enemies are ""war criminals"" -- Glenn Greenwald October 6, 2016 Greenwald's astute observations were presumably made in response to Secretary of State John Kerry's recent remarks that both Russia and Syria should face war crimes investigations for their recent attacks on Syrian civilians.Mr. Kerry said in Washington, where he spoke alongside French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, as reported by the Independent . Unsurprisingly, Russia responded by urging caution regarding allegations of war crimes considering the United States has been waging wars in a number of countries since the end of World War II. It has picked up a number of allegations of war crimes in the process. Kerry's continuous accusations that Russia bombed hospital infrastructure are particularly hypocritical in light of the fact the United States has bombed hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan on more than one occasion over past decade. Further, former congressman Ron Paul's Institute for Peace and Prosperity hit back at Kerry, accusing him of completely fabricating the most recent alleged hospital attack. As the Institute noted: "" In a press event yesterday, before talks with the French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault about a new UN resolution, he said about Syria: ""'Last night, the regime attacked yet another hospital, and 20 people were killed and 100 people were wounded. And Russia and the regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children and women. These are acts that beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes. And those who commit these would and should be held accountable for these actions.' "" No opposition group has claimed that such an extremely grave event happened. No press agency has a record of it. The MI-6 disinformation outlet SOHR in Britain, which quite reliably notes every claimed casualty and is frequently cited in 'western media,' has not said anything about such an event anywhere in Syria. "" However, the most disturbing aspect of Kerry's allegation is that the accusations against Russia run in tandem with Saudi Arabia's brutal assault on Yemen. Saudi Arabia, with the aid of a few regional players -- and with ongoing American and British assistance -- has been bombing Yemen back into the Stone Age without any legal basis whatsoever. Often, the Saudi-led coalition has completely decimated civilian infrastructure, which has led a number of groups to accuse the coalition of committing war crimes in the process. Civilians and civilian infrastructure have been struck so routinely that the world has become increasingly concerned the actual targets of the coalition strikes are civilians As noted by Foreign Policy : ""The Houthis and their allies -- armed groups loyal to Saleh -- are the declared targets of the coalition's 1-year-old air campaign. In reality, however, it is the civilians, such as Basrallah and Rubaid, and their children, who are predominantly the victims of this protracted war. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in airstrikes while asleep in their homes, when going about their daily activities, or in the very places where they had sought refuge from the conflict. The United States, Britain, and others, meanwhile, have continued to supply a steady stream of weaponry and logistical support to Saudi Arabia and its coalition. "" Yemen is the poorest, most impoverished nation in the Arab world. The Saudi-led coalition has been striking refugee camps, schools, wedding parties and well over 100 hospitals to date . The coalition has been strongly suspected of using banned munitions such as cluster bombs. The country now has more than half a million children at serious risk of malnutrition. More than 21 million out of the total population of 25 million are in serious need of basic humanitarian assistance. Just take one example of the cruel and disproportionate use of force that Saudi Arabia has used in Yemen -- against Judge Yahya Rubaid and his family. As Foreign Policy reported in March of this year: ""According to family members, Rubaid was a judge on a case against Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, for treason in absentia. It is unclear whether his house was attacked for this reason. What is clear, however, is that there was no legally valid basis for bombing his home, as he and his family were civilians and under international law should not have been deliberately targeted. "" At the time this article's publication, over 140 Yemenis had been killed and another 500 injured in a Saudi-coalition aerial attack on a funeral over the weekend. The civilian death toll continues to rise in Yemen, completely unchallenged by any major players at the U.N. When the U.N. does attempt to quell Saudi actions, the Saudis threaten severe economic retaliation. How Kerry can accuse Russia of committing war crimes in Syria with a straight face is unclear, as reports of atrocious crimes committed in Yemen continue to surface. This is not to say Russia and Syria should not be investigated for war crimes - but maybe, just maybe, we could live in a world where everyone responsible for committing these gross acts could be held accountable, instead of just those who pose an economic threat to the West.

ed38bc34-4dc9-4b5b-8046-cb47e725a25b,"In the same month that the United States has accused Russia of ""barbarism"" and Russia has accused the United States of supporting ISIS in Syria, a rare note of bilateral comity has been struck between the two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council in a sudden and ahead-of-schedule selection of the next U.N. secretary-general. Former Portuguese prime minister António Guterres, the odds-on favorite in many months of straw polling, has been chosen to head the international body following a decade of advocacy work as high commissioner for refugees, whose portfolio, owing to the humanitarian crises in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya, has only grown more urgent over the last several years. The pick was announced cheerfully by Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, at a press conference in New York attended by all 15 diplomats on the Security Council, including his verbal sparring partner and American counterpart, Samantha Power. A vote to confirm Guterres's appointment is scheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m. in New York, Churkin said. Moscow now heads the rotating presidency of the council and had given the strong impression that it preferred an Eastern European to take over from current Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose term expires in January. Guterres was a leading light beyond the establishment of Portugal's Socialist Party, following the country's Salazar-Caetano dictatorship. After leaving the premiership in 2005, Guterres assumed the presidency of the Socialist International. Guterres spent the bulk of his decade at UNHCR tightening bureaucracy and warning of the impending migrant crisis now gripping Europe. His three-year post was extended multiple times, and Ban, who is in Rome to celebrate the inauguration of the first annual Conference on Sport and Faith with the Vatican, resisted pressure to keep him on another year. Guterres was often a voice of support for efforts made by front-line nations Greece and Italy, scolding the larger European Union for turning a blind eye to the worsening problem. In a statement months before he retired, Guterres said: ""The selfless generosity of private citizens and civil society organizations reaching out to welcome and help the new arrivals is truly inspiring. And there has been exemplary political and moral leadership from a number of countries. But overall, Europe has failed to find an effective common response, and people have suffered as a result."" Portugal, an EU member state as well as one of the charter members of NATO, in many ways seemed a strange provenance for the world's next top diplomat. Most of this year's contenders hailed from the Balkans or former Soviet satellite countries. In an unprecedentedly transparent process, more akin to a democratic national election, all had to submit proposals for how they intended to fulfill their visions of U.N. leadership and turn up in the General Assembly to defend their policies in a debate-style forum. They even tweeted responses to questions from the public of 7 billion they aim to represent. The United States and United Kingdom were pushing for a woman, the first in history, to take over from Ban. In recent days, Guterres's closest opponent was latecomer Kristalina Georgieva, the European Commission's vice president, who only joined the race last week. Other candidates over the six-month campaign have included Georgieva's fellow Bulgarian Irina Bokova, the director general of UNESCO who, like Gueterres, has found herself being quoted in the international press as her organization has had to preside over the wholesale destruction of antiquities in Iraq and Syria following the conquest of the so-called Islamic State; and Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand and well as the administrator of the U.N. Development Programme, where despite a somewhat controversial internal tenure, she impressed the broader constituency of U.N. staff, earning the most-favored status for secretary-general in a 1,000-person U.N. survey taken last February. The U.N. secretary-general is not bound by term limits. However, in 70 years, no one has served more than a decade. Guterres will be the ninth person to occupy the role since the United Nations' founding in 1946. ""Guterres is a very good politician and politics is important,"" Bruno Maçães, Portugal's former Europe minister, told The Daily Beast. To have a first-rate politician at the helm will be a good change at the U.N."" -- With additional reporting by Barbie Latza Nadeau"

State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that the diplomatic process is difficult to pursue in the midst of the carnage, but said the Obama administration didn't want to ""definitively close the door yet."" Mr. Toner described the diplomatic process as ""on life support, but it's not flat-lined yet"" and said the U.S. could walk away in hours or days. The two powers agreed early in September on a cease-fire and military cooperation plan, but the deal fell apart after about a week. Mr. Kerry spoke to his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for the third time in three days on Friday. The discussion took place as Mr. Kerry was traveling back from Israel, where he had attended the funeral of Israeli statesman Shimon Peres along with President Barack Obama and other senior U.S. officials. Mr. Kerry first warned Mr. Lavrov in a phone call Wednesday that the U.S. would walk away from talks with Moscow on Syria if Russia didn't take immediate steps to reinstate the cease-fire and allow the passage of humanitarian aid. The U.S. provided few details about Friday's talks.

7c0a597c-fbf3-484b-bbb9-4d9c5cf642da,"Introduction Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea may have been a transformational moment in global politics. Since then, many have been awaiting Russian president Vladimir Putin's next move. Has he accomplished in Ukraine all he set out to do, or was Crimea the first salvo in an attempt to revise the post-Cold War geopolitical order? Former United States secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton likened Putin's actions in Crimea to those of Hitler's Germany prior to the Second World War. Should Putin have been taken more seriously when he first lamented the demise of the Soviet Union upon taking power in 2000? There has been no shortage of speculation about Putin's motives among international relations and Russia scholars. Overwhelmingly, there has been a chorus of skepticism about Russia's declared motives for military action in Ukraine, with many prominent scholars warning of Putin's revanchist foreign policy goals. The prevailing wisdom holds that geopolitics and balancing against Western power are Putin's game; other motivations, notably those Putin has himself articulated, have received less attention. Such an oversimplification represents a long-standing failure to appreciate the multiple influences on Russian foreign policy. This paper does not rule out the presence of cultural and geopolitical resentment in post-Soviet Russia and the resulting security-based vulnerabilities that influence Russian foreign policy; however, it suggests that there are factors that animate Russian foreign policy under Putin that have been delegitimized in mainstream analysis. Putin's actions are not simply guided by old fashioned geopolitics; analysts need not look any further than Putin's own words to conclude that Russian foreign policy under his leadership is shaped by, and shapes, a sense of Russian identity that is highly influenced by its relations with the West, particularly the US. This connection is acknowledged among scholars and it is also visible in Russia's 2014 actions in Ukraine. Drawing on the principle of privileging discourse as an analytical tool in foreign policy analysis, as well as the premise that ideas shape practice, but also that practice shapes ideas, this paper emphasizes identity and the role of ideas in shaping Russian foreign policy. Much scholarship seeking to explain Russia's actions in Ukraine has underemphasized the interplay between identity and foreign policy in favour of accentuating Putin's misguided notions of realpolitik . While a structural focus on Putin's geopolitical revanchism is not entirely without merit, this paper takes the view that attention must also be paid to oft-neglected internal influences on foreign policy, and the ideas that underscore it, some of which Putin has himself acknowledged. In so doing, it privileges ""relations"" in the study of IR by focusing less on the generic expectations for power-driven state action and more on how Putin has justified Russia's actions. Considering Putin's own narrative, at face value, provides an alternative way of understanding Russian foreign policy based on the articulations of the actor himself. After all, ""a nation's foreign policy may not always align with what outsiders believe are their long term interests."" Moreover, given Putin's domestic political popularity throughout and following the Crimea action, there is reason to believe that his own narrative resonates with Russians themselves. The discourse around Russian identity--especially as it relates to relations with Crimea and other Russian diasporas--is crucial to understanding Russian motives there, as well as in potential future actions. Privileging the connection between identity and foreign policy, and considering Putin's narrative about Russia's borderlands, this paper demonstrates how the West's own actions--exemplified by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization --have fed Putin's narrative. Geopolitics--the ""old school contests"" over territorial and military power --cannot alone explain Putin's actions, but may have contributed to shaping Putin's ideational narrative. Ultimately this paper contends that Russia's actions in Ukraine are best explained by the West's provocation of Russia, epitomized by NATO's eastward expansion, and the resulting cultural and geopolitical vulnerability that animates Putin's ideational narrative; and by Putin's assessment of Russia's relations with its neighbours, with whom Russia is said to share a historical and cultural bond. Both phenomena have fostered a desire to create an alternative to Western dominance of world affairs. How Putin perceives relations with Russia's neighbours and with the West are importantly related. All three post-Soviet Russian presidents have expressed concern over Western encroachment--notably NATO expansion--but these concerns were largely ignored by Western leaders, and downplayed by Western scholars. Russian actions in Ukraine in 2014-2015 may be viewed, in part, as a response to this fear, but also as consistent with Putin's impulse to protect Russian identity in the face of Western encroachment. Put simply, NATO is not entirely to blame for backing Russia into a corner and forcing Putin's hand as some have suggested; however, the West's treatment of Russia does figure prominently in Putin's own conceptions of Russian exceptionalism and his nation's potential role as an alternative to Western power. This paper's contribution to the volumes dedicated to ""understanding Putin"" is to discuss the ideas behind the apparent aggressive turn in Russian foreign policy, and to present a more complete view of them. It then suggests that NATO best exemplifies the impact that relations with the West have had on Russia's perceptions of its own vulnerabilities and interests. Finally, the paper examines Putin's narrative about Russia's connection with its neighbours, and his justification for military intervention in Ukraine, ultimately arguing that his rationale for these actions reflects an evolving ideational narrative that increasingly seeks to promote Russia as an important centre of regional and global power, and also as challenger to the West's dominance of international law and politics. It goes beyond the existing structural narrative that reduces Putin's actions in Ukraine to the principles of realpolitik by critically examining some of the leading scholarship on Putin's ""ideology,"" and his actions in Ukraine, thereby revealing the space for an alternative way of understanding Putin's foreign policy that considers the articulated views of Putin himself and acknowledges the importance of ideas, shaped in part by the West's own actions, in Putin's calculations. This renders a more comprehensive understanding of Russian foreign policy, which will be essential in the short to medium term, as Putin shows little sign of relinquishing power any time soon. The discussion proceeds from three assumptions about understanding foreign policy making in post-Soviet Russia, one practical, one theoretical, and the third methodological. First, the phrases ""Putin's foreign policy"" and ""Russia's foreign policy"" are used interchangeably. This is due to the Russian Federation's strong executive presidency, which concentrates decision-making power, particularly for foreign policy, in the hands of the president and his close advisers. Structure and agency remain a crucial focus for understanding how Russian foreign policy is made; the institution of the presidency dominates all others and enables the occupant to govern with a strong hand. Putin's presidency is characterized by a well-documented domination of Russian law and politics and a personal popularity that undergirds this ""super-presidential"" system in which the institutional influences of other political actors are dwarfed. The second assumption concerns the value and influence of identity in understanding foreign policy. This paper assumes that there is value in reflecting on how national identity is understood by decision makers. National identity is presumed to be a construction, and therefore must be understood as a fluid phenomenon, which bears upon leaders' prioritization of national goals and elite conceptions of the national interest, themselves a construction, and therefore prone to fluctuation. This paper's focus on Putin's ideational narrative about Russian exceptionalism goes beyond the traditional contributions of mainstream IR, which tend to focus on structural geopolitical explanations for state actions, instead holding that consideration of Putin's ideational narrative reveals a continuity in his actions toward Russia's neighbours, perceived to hold a historical and cultural connection to Russia. It does not discount geopolitical factors; in fact, it demonstrates their role in shaping Putin's narrative. In so doing, the paper builds on the identity and foreign policy literature, both within IR and within Russian foreign policy analysis, as well as Waever and Hanson's work on the value of discourse in foreign policy analysis and Pouliot's emphasis on the reciprocal connection between ideas and practice. If national identity is constructed, then so, too, are the goals and actions taken in its name. Moreover, leaders themselves play a significant role in shaping ideas as well as the national interest, based on their own interpretation of history and perception of events, especially in the case of Putin's Russia, given what we know about presidential power in the Kremlin. Finally, a comment on methodology. Western analysis of Putin's foreign policy motivations and actions in Ukraine in 2014 is limited by its reluctance to privilege Putin's own articulations of Russian national interests, which have themselves been constructed in response to historical experience and also by his interpretation of the actions of the West toward Russia in the post-Cold War era. It is not the case that Putin's ""real motives"" are hidden and must be uncovered in Russian-language sources. On the contrary, his views are in abundance, available in multiple English-language sources. The argument being made here is not that better translation of Putin's ideas is needed, but rather that a new way of considering them may be essential to the Western goal of ""understanding Putin."" Valuing discourse: Putin's ideational narrative and foreign policy Russian national identity has never been straightforward, but some 25 years after the end of the Cold War, an identity may well be crystallizing. The question of how to understand Putin, in American and Western analysis, has often centred on the question of ideology. But ideology is a loaded term, both in regular discourse and also within Russia in particular. Rather than focusing on ideology per se, this paper asks ""to what extent do ideas, worldviews, and identity-based influences come to bear on Putin's decisions?"" It considers the presence of Putin's ideational narrative--his story of Russia's past, present, and future--that is brought to bear on Russia's relations with both the West and with its neighbours and the important way in which these relations intersect. Putin has often been called a realist, a pragmatist, a geopolitical thinker. Some conclusions have been drawn, notably that Putin is both a product of, and perpetuates, the patrimonialism that continues to characterize Russian governance. In many ways he fills the role of patrimonial leader for a country that demands this leadership style, or at least supports it in the absence of an alternative. While Western critics blame Putin for this phenomenon, Anna Arutunyan argues that this system predates Putin and that he has taken the necessary steps to make it work for him. Putin uses this system to his advantage, to keep his loyal friends rich and himself in power. Arutunyan considers him a ""mirror for Russian society, a product of his times, reflecting what was desired of him on a subconscious level."" It is not clear, however, that Putin's understanding of Russian history and power constitutes an ideology per se. Donaldson and Nogee note that ""the loss of ideology's official standing, combined with the fall of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics itself, left a conceptual void in the foreign policy of the newly independent Russian Federation that raised to the forefront the question of Russia's national identity."" That space needed to be filled. Putin has filled it, and in a way that is consistent with the national attitude that the West is to blame for not taking Russian power seriously. Little unites a nation more than a common enemy; before Putin it was not immediately clear that this was what the West constituted. But over time, and under Putin, the concern about Western encroachment and neglect of Russian power crystallized, owing in no small part to the American-driven eastward expansion of NATO. By 2014 Putin seemed to think, and this appears to be supported by Russians, that the presumption of Western hegemony and the dangers this posed to Russia were that enemy. This view has informed the evolution of Putin's ideational narrative about the need for Russia as an alternative to the dangerous West. Western scholars have watched this emerging narrative with much interest, but also with suspicion. For Arutunyan, Putin exhibits no ideology per se, apart from remaining in power. This echoes an early consensus about the absence of ideology in Putin's Russia; however, some claim this is changing. Prior to Putin's third term Russia was, arguably, an ideological vacuum, especially under Boris Yeltsin. Therefore, the business of reinstating national mission and articulating a national vision has faced its challenges and has also revived competition with the West. On first taking office, Putin showed little interest in ideology, but over time is said to be subscribing to an evolving narrative about Russia's role in the world. Morozova claims that Putin rejects ideology out of a fear of revolution; his preference is for the ""stable endurance of the present."" This means that clear identity-based goals were not identified, which may partly explain why it has been so challenging to derive meaning from Putin's actions. It has been difficult to understand what motivates foreign policy beyond Russia's stated interests in being a great power and being recognized as such. Throughout the 1990s, Russian foreign policy debates were characterized by competing visions about Russia's place in the world--Eurasianism vs. Those who favoured a non-identity-based articulation of Russia's interests won. Putin, the pragmatist, personified this shift away from ideocracy. Morozova confirms this, observing a shift from ""an ideology-permeated and mission-oriented foreign policy to an interest-driven one associated with diversification and pragmatism."" With Putin's third term, the reconstruction of Russia's past and its imagined destiny have resurfaced in foreign policy thinking. Putin's ideational narrative--the story of Russian culture and experience that Putin, and Russians themselves, appear to have internalized, and that is now increasingly reflected in foreign policy--has evolved in tandem with the decline of Russia's relations with the US, and with what might be labelled a ""heightened siege mentality"" among the Russian leadership. Putinism , if there is such a thing, is becoming more nationalist in nature and reflects the feeling that Russia is under threat from a hostile West bent on undermining Russian interests. Igor Panarin confirms this view, observing that Putin possesses an ideology that seeks ""to preserve and further develop moral and cultural values and become a moral core and the center of gravity for the cultures of the West and the East, the North and the South."" The more threatened Russia feels by Western dominance, the greater the rationale for providing an alternative. Western scholarship largely converges with the notion that Russian foreign policy--notably the 2014 action in Ukraine--reflects a calculation made on the basis of resistance to Western aggression, and soundly rejects the legitimacy of Russia's interpretation. Attention turns to Russia's failure to accept the geopolitical settlement after the Cold War and its return to national self-determination, realized through spheres of influence, military bases, and boundaries. Little heed is paid to the connection between the actions of the West and their impact on Russia's emerging narrative, one which has been articulated by Putin himself. It must be acknowledged that national identity is ""continuously rewritten on the basis of external events"" and responds not to ""real threats but to constructed dangers."" Alexander Dugin aptly labels Putin a Russian conservative who values statism. In such a system, leaders are exalted and are often inoculated against blame for their mistakes. Bad decisions are the result of bad advice; powerful leaders govern above the fray and are vaunted for their commitment to the idea of the nation, often based on a sense of historical mission, tradition, greatness. Putin himself acknowledges his conservatism: ""the point of conservatism is not that it prevents movement forward and upward but that it prevents movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state."" Melikhov notes that nations have a ""powerful psychological need"" to find satisfaction in a ""special path."" This can be both offensive and defensive in nature; offensive paths are those that call upon a nation to seize its path by force, ""or at least do all it can to spoil the triumph of the victors."" This may have been visible in the Russian response to the Euromaidan movement in Ukraine in 2013-2014. Acknowledging Russian statism under Putin, Walter Laqueur has also observed an ideological shift in Russian foreign policy that may mark a return to Russian ideology prior to 1917--Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality--labelled ""the triad"" by Czar Nicholas. Laqueur postulates a return of autocracy in particular, since it required ""unconditional loyalty to the czar,"" the parallels to which can be seen under Putin, of course. This may not be unreasonable: Putin did assert that ""Russia should look to its own history and traditional values"" to give meaning to its post-Soviet identity and mission; there is continuity between the old and the new. Continuing to rely on the past for ideological cues, Laqueur points to anti-Westernism as a feature of both old and new Russian ideology. Russia has always struggled to be acknowledged as an equal by the West, whether it was the British Empire, France, or Germany. The sentiment is the same, but the object of Russia's obsession has changed. Laqueur notes, ""America, and only to a lesser extent Europe, are Russia's enemies, eager to hurt the motherland in every possible way."" In the nineteenth century, anti-Westernism was cultural; under the Soviets, it was ideological; and now Laqueur accuses Putin of intellectual laziness for adapting old ideas to the present day. Laqueur seems to think that there is no legitimate reason to be fearful of the West, that Putin is whipping up fear and anti-Western sentiment because it plays well domestically. Put another way, anti-Westernism is the means to an end, the vehicle by which Putin advances his personal power interests. Laqueur's view undervalues, or flatly ignores, the possibility that the West's actions--notably the expansion of NATO--have contributed to shaping Putin's narrative about Russian identity and its place in the international system. It is misguided to discount the claims Putin makes about the vulnerability Russia feels in relation to the West simply because Putin's style of domestic governance is one that Western leaders abhor. Not trusting Putin is one thing; but this is not sufficient reason to ignore the growing nationalism that underscores Putin's motives for Russia's actions in Ukraine. The West has been ""writing off"" Russia's concerns since the end of the Cold War, arguably not to a productive end. Putin is motivated by more than his statist tendencies or his personal interest in power. There is more to Russia's motivations than Western analysts seem prepared to acknowledge. There is tremendous power in ideas; as Putin's ideational narrative about Russian exceptionalism takes hold, it must be better understood. We underestimate him at our own peril. Melik Kaylan acknowledges the tendency to deny the values or ideology at the heart of Putin's actions. Repeatedly it is assumed that the Kremlin possesses no vision for Russia's future. While this may have been true in Putin's early years, it now appears that he ""espouses a discernible, exportable, full-fledged 'ism,'"" one that the West has been slow to identify. He is no longer simply reflexively anti-American; this was evident under Medvedev, when Putin went along with a decidedly pro-Western sentiment and a decision to reorient foreign policy in a West-friendly direction. Kaylan notes that Western analysis seems committed to a ""monochromatic"" narrative about Putin--that he is a populist bad guy who cannot be trusted. Putin's cynicism is evidenced by his efforts to grant asylum to Edward Snowden; his efforts to influence the ousting of former Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili; his support in the United Nations Security Council and now Russia's military engagement in Syria, both to support Bashar al-Assad; and his role in reversing Ukraine's turn toward the European Union . Many of these examples reflect an emerging narrative that situates Russia as an alternative to Western dominance of the international system. As Kaylan suggests, Putin offers ""an alternate set of ideas capable of competing internationally with those of the US."" Putin is advancing Russia's interests within a system of rules designed by the West. The West may interpret international law selectively to justify its interventions; so can Russia. When Putin defends his actions in Ukraine or argues in favour of the need to protect eastern brethren from Western encroachment or a need to defend Russia's neighbours from the presumption of Western hegemony or the dominance of Western liberal values, he does so because this discourse reflects his own constructions of Russia's spheres of historical and cultural connection--a discourse he has interpreted and disseminated. To chalk up Putin's ideas about Russia's cultural connections to adjacent lands as an ""excuse"" for his ""real plans"" for Europe is to disadvantage one's analysis. Putin's narrative must be viewed not simply as one that explains history but also as one that imagines the future. We have seen Russia protect its historical brethren before and we could very well see it again. Putin has artfully capitalized on the extant discontent felt toward the US, enabling him to resist the West's liberal narrative. Putin criticizes the West for its ""abstract principles,"" imposed from above onto weaker nations, and offers the defence of a Russian alternative, particularly to neighbour countries that may not find all they need in league with the West. There is conservatism present in these communities that does not easily align with Western liberal definitions of human rights or of relationships between religion and the state. If Putin can present an alternative to the Western model that is credible, he can advance his imagined goal of a powerful Russia on the world stage. Kaylan points out that Putin astutely interprets what he can cast as a crisis of confidence in Western societies as they are being overcome by their own values. Societies ""formed of predominantly political values... where the political system creates identity rather than reflecting it, leads inevitably to deeply troubled outcomes."" Those taking a more conservative view, who believe that religion must have a role in shaping values, find it difficult to look west for guidance because religion in the West often takes a back seat to political values. So the defenders of faith may be drawn to what Putin represents . Kaylan notes that Putin's strong stand against the West's so-called ""misguided values"" resonates with both conservative Christian and Muslim populations. Putin criticizes America for assuming universalism in its definition of human rights and the state's responsibility to its people. In his famous 2007 Munich Speech, he criticized the US for unilateralism, its abuses of power, for being the source of great instability in the international system, for using international law selectively, and for creating intractable problems. This speech was a watershed moment in the articulation of Putin's world view, and for the responsibility for the mismanagement of global affairs that he places squarely on American shoulders. It was this speech that arguably prompted many to decry the return of the Cold War. Putin not only openly criticized the US, but did so in front of an audience of US congressmen and Defence Secretary Robert Gates, accusing the US of provoking countless military conflicts, resolving none, and making the international system a dangerous place. He then suggested that because the US was such a poor steward of the global order, it was time to consider a wholesale overhaul of the global security architecture. It may be fair to suggest that Putin's actions in Ukraine some seven years later are the culmination of this ideational narrative. Kaylan observes that Putin is exploiting the divide between Western values and the rest of the world. As the West itself seems confused about its own beliefs, and other states reject its moralistic trajectory, Putin sees an opportunity to carve out a place for Russia as a leader of an alternate narrative. This narrative appears to be shaped in part by an understanding of Russia's global potential as an alternative to the West, combined with concerns about a hostile West that has failed to acknowledge Russia's rightful place as a major power in the international system by denying its cultural and strategic relationships in its own backyard. This understanding of history seems to have shaped a certain discourse in Russia, and particularly with Putin, that the shared historical experience of Russia and its Slavic brethren must be defended and asserted. This discourse seems to be striking the right tone with many Russians and is proving to be an important force in foreign policy matters. But any sense of historical connection, real or imagined, is still, at its core, a construction. Whether this historical connection truly exists in the minds of all is beside the point; the more this connection is celebrated, the more it becomes valued and its preservation justified. As Pouliot notes, the more something is practised, the more it shapes ideas. Putin's 2014 actions in Ukraine, taken ostensibly to preserve this connection, asserted to be within Russia's national interests, may serve to reinforce it all the more. Weldes and Gilmore note that the ""national interest"" should be conceptualized as a social construction, one that policymakers play a key role in fostering. Before taking action, decision makers ""engage in a process of interpretation in order to understand both what situation the state faces and how they should respond to it. This process of shared interpretation, in turn, presupposes a language shared, at least, by those state officials involved in determining state action and by the audience for whom state action must be legitimate."" Russia's perception of its relationship to its Slavic neighbours, as well as its perception of NATO expansion, may be considered in this way. Over time, the Russians have constructed a certain understanding about the meaning of NATO expansion, which has influenced its response to it. As time goes by, the construction of the threat of NATO has become stronger, only reinforcing earlier reservations, which strengthens the fear of Western hegemony. This is not to suggest these fears are imagined; the West has done little to suggest that Russia's conceptions of its national interests--largely wrapped up in these concerns--are manufactured. Instead, Western actions have only served to solidify Russia's sense of cultural and security vulnerability. Russia's connection to its neighbours, due to a deep ethno-cultural connection, has come to shape Putin's conception of Russian identity. As Hansen and Waever note, ""identity is a relational concept,"" and so it becomes essential to ""identify specific concepts which historically have come to take on a particular importance as vehicles of identity production."" To connect this ideational narrative to foreign policy, we must focus not only on what the identity is , but we must also concern ourselves with how this identity is conceived . In other words, what is the ""we"" that is being conceived of? The construction of identity is highly politicized; the idea of belonging is perhaps even more powerful than the belonging itself. This paper now turns to the two critical influences on Putin's ideational narrative: the role of the West, and the extent to which this has shaped Russia's sense of responsibility to protect its neighbours and promote its identity. Putin's narrative, the West, and the expansion of NATO The decision by Western leaders to skip the 2015 70th Anniversary Victory Day military parade in Moscow's Red Square symbolizes the hostility Russia perceives from the West. Failure to observe and celebrate Russia's role in liberating Europe from Nazi Germany is interpreted as a denial of Russian nationhood. Some 20 million Russians died in the Second World War; Russia's contribution was instrumental in liberating a continent and solidifying its place in the global power structure. It is understandable that Western leaders did not want to applaud the massive parade of Russian military might so soon after the illegal annexation of Crimea and the role Russia's military has played in destabilizing Ukraine. However, the marginalization of Russia's historical role and rightful place in the commemoration of the end of the Second World War has only solidified for Putin--and likely for many Russians--that Russia has something to fear from the West. Notwithstanding Putin's revival of Russian exceptionalism, he has been described as a pragmatist. Putin seemed to appreciate that working with the West is sometimes essential to Russia's interests; this was evidenced by condolences to the US after 9/11 and his willingness to share Russian intelligence on Al Qaeda, and even by his willingness to allow a ""reset"" with the US during the tandem presidency of Dmitri Medvedev in which presidential succession took place, but Putin remained, as prime minister, a powerful presence in the Kremlin. However, Putin still maintained a running narrative of Russian opposition to NATO's expansion, especially into Georgia in 2008; he saw fit to wage a war there against a pro-Western regime to prevent it. When Russia has flexed its muscles, so to speak, it has done so carefully, to avoid scaring away a West that Russia needed. But Galeotti and Bowen aptly recognize that this has changed; Putin now exhibits behaviour that ""eschews the pragmatism that marked his first administration."" They note that Putin seems to have lost interest in consensus building and has taken more direct control over the decision process in Crimea; Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu played no visible role in that process. This paper contends that the West has played a key role in the redefining of Russian exceptionalism. Putin has long made the case that NATO expansion into Russia's sphere of interest is threatening. Fears of Western influences contaminating Russian culture or turning its logical regional allies into foes have been fomenting for years. Galeotti and Bowen observe that Putin's brand of exceptionalism is cultural: Russia is at the centre of a civilizational empire, which in part explains its actions in Crimea. Putin considers Crimea an ethnically and culturally Russian region that had been separated from the motherland. This situation needed to be corrected; the ethnic kin needed to be reunited. This suggests that Crimea is unique. Putin's efforts to restore Russian exceptionalism seem less about expanding Russian state power into foreign lands and more about restoring Russian leadership among ethnic Russians, many of whom have been separated from the motherland. This connection will be developed later in the paper. Nonetheless, the idea of restoring Russian greatness appears to be influential in Putin's foreign policy calculus. With the Cold War over, and the West's adversary dissolved, numerous scholars and practitioners advised NATO leaders that the alliance's dissolution would be instrumental for the future of European security. The end of the Cold War was somewhat anticlimactic; there was no peace agreement, so no formal peace needed to be kept. Therefore, NATO's infrastructure was not necessary to advance European security goals. However, instead of disbanding, NATO grew both its membership and its mandate. Even George Kennan, architect of the US grand strategy of containment, warned the US Senate of the dangers of ratifying NATO's expansion, saying, ""I think the Russians will react adversely,"" and reminding them that ""our differences in the Cold War were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime."" Kennan was right: NATO's growth sent an important signal to Russian leaders, despite NATO's reassurances that its expansion had nothing to do with Russia, that hostilities remained. This was evident in the stampede of former Soviet bloc countries clamouring to get into both NATO and the EU, many of which brought a ""spirit of Russophobia"" with them. The consequences of this rapid expansion of NATO, which Russian leaders perceived as threatening from the outset, are scarcely surprising. Roy Allison quotes Putin in March 2014 as saying, ""we could not allow a historical part of the Russian territory with a predominantly ethnic Russian population to be incorporated into an international military alliance"" or the movement of ""NATO infrastructure... directly towards the Russian border."" Russia has assumed that the West's recent interest in Ukraine's political troubles, and its interest in Russia's neighbourhood generally, is for little more than the purposes of fomenting hostile governments along Russian borders to undermine plans for a Eurasian Union. This is precisely how Russian leaders have interpreted most of NATO's efforts to develop relationships with these nations since the end of the Cold War. It has always been viewed through this lens, and the Euromaidan movement got a little too close for comfort. Putin seems prepared to set up a ""geopolitical fault line"" through Ukraine by force, an approach Allison calls a ""policy of strategic denial"" to ""demarcate the CIS regional order as a 'no-go zone' for NATO."" There is continuity here: this same sentiment existed under President Yeltsin; Russia had little choice but to accept NATO's expansion to Central Europe in 1999, and even further eastward in 2004. Yeltsin drew the line at NATO moving into CIS territory. President Medvedev struck a similar tone in the 2008 war with Georgia, acknowledging that Russia's actions there had something to do with keeping NATO out, noting, ""if we had faltered in 2008, geopolitical arrangements would be different now and a number of countries... would probably be in NATO."" While it may be true that Russia's diplomatic efforts to reverse the ground NATO has made in expanding eastward have not been entirely successful, it is fair to say that its military efforts have been: NATO became less interested in a destabilized Georgia. So the message delivered to Putin after 2008 was essentially that military force was an effective way to discourage Western interest. Moreover, this occurred under President George W. Bush, who was famously unafraid to use military power to resolve complex problems. Regarding Ukraine, Putin was dealing with President Obama, who did not articulate a clear policy doctrine that made American intentions clear. It was no doubt part of Putin's calculus that, if Russia's military response worked in 2008 under President Bush, surely it would continue to be effective under President Obama. Russian leaders have communicated their concerns about NATO expansion and missile defence systems in East-Central Europe repeatedly, but these have fallen on deaf ears. If Western leaders only respond to acts of aggression, then it should scarcely be a surprise that this was Putin's tool of choice in Ukraine. Putin demonstrated the lengths to which Russia is prepared to go to protect its sphere of interest. When asked about the war in Georgia, he said, ""when an aggressor comes into your territory, you need to punch him in the face."" Georgia was not Russian territory legally, but Western actions were seen as efforts to limit Russia's consolidation of its regional integration. Putin sees this as a direct ""challenge to the legitimacy of the Russian political system."" This challenges Putin's brand of exceptionalism and also his desire to assert Russia as a major global player and opposite pole to Western power. Some scholars are less convinced about the influence of the West in Putin's Russia. Alexander Motyl has been highly critical of accusations made by prominent IR scholars, most famously by John J. Mearsheimer in 2014, that Putin's actions in Crimea are a direct result of persistent Western efforts to expand NATO and the West's failure to consider that Russia is a great power: when backed into corners, all great powers can be expected to behave the way Russia has. Mearsheimer argued, at the height of the Crimea crisis, that Russia's actions in Ukraine in 2014 were motivated by fear of the West so close to Russia's borders; this assessment was based on the realist notion that great powers inherently fear the presence of another major power on their doorstep and this fear causes them to respond aggressively. Motyl has criticized this approach for applying simplistic theory to like units without bothering to understand the finer points of Russian-Ukrainian relations, the place of ideology in foreign policy decision making, and Putin's own personal calculations. Motyl is correct to discount realism's structural explanation for the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but he rejects the expansion of NATO as an influential factor in Putin's calculus too vigorously. Mearsheimer has rightly seized on a central concern that all three Russian presidents have expressed since the end of the Cold War: Russia fears NATO's encroachment into Russian spheres of interest. The West figures prominently in Putin's calculations and always has. But the perceived eastward push of NATO, encouraged during the Euromaidan movement, is helping to nurse a renewed version of exceptionalism in which Putin asserts Russia's cultural right to dominate its region and to resist the influences of Western values. The expansion of NATO has enabled Putin's narrative about the presumption of Western hegemony, efforts to deny Russia's historical and cultural connection to its neighbours, and the Russian imperative to resist this encroachment. It is not necessary to employ a realist lens to see that the expansion of NATO eastward has contributed to the deterioration in relations with Russia. Motyl suggests that the appropriate lens is one that appreciates the ways in which Putin uses ideology and ideas to construct a Russian identity that counters Western influence and dominates the region. He aptly labels identity and ideology social constructions, the appreciation of which is essential to understanding Putin; however, the West--and NATO--factor into these considerations in important ways that Motyl is reluctant to recognize. Motyl feels that NATO expansion is in no way a threat to Russia. He posits: ""just how could a feeble alliance that lost its sense of purpose after the end of the Cold War and that consists of countries that have slashed their defence budgets, cannot imagine going to war anywhere, and would certainly never send troops to save Estonia, say, from a Russian takeover, be a threat to anybody?"" Notwithstanding the extant divisions within NATO that Motyl identifies, Russian perceptions of it still matter. Foreign Minister Lavrov himself noted that the US is ""agreeing to continue dialogue, but go on doing what they already decided for themselves and got moving through a decision of NATO."" It is the symbolic discounting of Russian interests, and how this impacts Russians' self-perception and the quest to operationalize feelings of exceptionalism that are really the issue. Certainly NATO expansion offers more of an explanation than Mearsheimer acknowledges. Russia finds NATO expansion threatening because post-Soviet Russia defines itself very much in terms of its relations with the West in general and the US more specifically, and because the remaining areas into which NATO considers expansion are considered by Russia to be culturally and ideationally important. This influence on Putin's decisions is critical. It is worth considering indications that not all security-related decisions are eclipsed by a competitive geopolitical mindset toward the West. Putin's cooperation in the process of dispute settlement in the Arctic and Russia's policy on nuclear weapons are indications of his pragmatism and of the role that Russia's perceived vulnerability plays in its orientation toward the West. He has in these areas favoured the de-escalation of conflict with the West. One might think that if geopolitical calculations exclusively governed Putin's decisions then Russia might be less inclined to accept the lack of parity with the West when it comes to its nuclear capability; instead, Russia has been a committed partner in this area. This is likely due to the fact that nuclear weapons do not represent an area of security vulnerability for Russia; instead, its role as a major nuclear power reinforces Russia's great power identity. But NATO expansion into its neighbourhood is perceived to jeopardize this. Motyl accuses Putin of possessing a ""neo-imperial ideology,"" which means that Russia must be made great again and that all Russian speakers deserve the state's protection; he also interprets Putin's actions as neo-imperialist due to the belief that ""Ukraine is an artificial state with no right to exist,"" except to be part of the hegemonic empire that seeks to build in the ""near abroad."" Of all of Putin's stated reasons for the annexation of Crimea, he has emphasized, first and foremost, that Crimea is historically Russian and that it holds a special place in Russian memory and culture. The need to reassert Russia's regional influence is explained in one of Putin's post-Crimea speeches in which he accused the West of mistreating a ""humbled Russia"" after the fall of the Soviet Union and forcing Russia to accept arrangements against its interests because it was in no position to resist; Putin was responding to injustices and humiliations Russia has suffered at the hands of the West, which have caused Russia to seek redress. The concerns about Western encroachment continue. President Obama's September 2014 announcement of a new partnership with Georgia and Moldova continues a trend of encirclement that Russia has been enduring since 1990. When Obama announced the 2014 stationing of US war planes in Estonia, his words in Tallinn were impactful: ""You lost your independence before; with NATO you will never lose it again,"" and ""the defence of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defence of Berlin and Paris and London."" Stephen Cimbala recalls that ""Russia's national security concept of 2010 and its related military doctrine show fears of surprise attack in the face of NATO conventional military superiority. This concern became especially acute in the period immediately following NATO's 1999 war against Yugoslavia, coincident with the official enlargement of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic."" Cimbala goes on to note that NATO defeated a historic Russian ally and this was a perceived defeat for Russia; NATO should recognize that it backed Russia into a corner and should not let its rightful criticisms of the invasion of Crimea get in the way of needed ""political and military collaboration with Russia."" The goal here is not to dwell on whether the West mishandled its post-Cold War relations with Russia; instead it is to suggest that Western actions had a transformative effect on Russian foreign policy, fostering cultural and security vulnerabilities that have shaped Putin's narrative about Russian power, borne out in its actions in Crimea. It may very well be the case that Russia's actions in Crimea, in part a response to NATO's eastward expansion, have actually served to reanimate the alliance. Russian leaders have consistently tried to resist or reverse the expansion of NATO, but may now have justified its growth. David Benn is correct to note that perhaps expansion makes more sense today than at any time in the post-Cold War period, given the perceived threat that Russia presents. Nonetheless, at the time that NATO chose to do most of its expanding, there was no tangible Russian threat. Therefore, despite the rationale that NATO has for its expansion, the move made little sense to those outside the West, and this added to the siege mentality already present in Moscow. Benn rightly argues that the West's approach, particularly that of the US, has been to ignore Russia until it poses a threat and then to try to contain it; this has contributed to a dysfunctional relationship since the early 1990s. Arguably, this dynamic has turned Ukraine into a buffer state between East and West. This cannot be attributed to Russian actions alone. Putin's narrative, Russian identity, and the 2014 Ukraine crisis As noted above, the West has always figured prominently in Russian conceptions of its own power and status in the international realm. Putin himself seems to view Russia's exceptional historical roots through the lens of the West. Putin labelled 2014 a ""Year of Culture"" in which he announced that the country would celebrate its exceptionalism via a return to ""patriotism, values and ethics."" This was in many ways a response to the gradual influences of Western- and foreign-educated elites in Russia, who are a more difficult market for his brand of autocracy. Galeotti and Bowen label these efforts a program of ""de-offshorization,"" characterized by efforts to reign in the elite and to punish those who were responsible for the outflow of Russian capital. They acknowledge that the celebration of exceptionalism does not represent an ideological turn, since these ideas are not exported en masse the way ideologies often are; Putin does not appear to be exporting a visible political philosophy beyond the notion that Russia is historically unique and that this history defines not only Russia but also the region in which it lives. The identity of Russia as an exceptional culture with a ""singular place in history"" seems to govern relations with its neighbours. This influences how Russia views its legally sovereign neighbours as a lost component of its exceptional past. Putin views Russia's identity as linked to Ukraine. He has noted that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians all have a common history and ""cannot live without each other."" He recalled the ""Russian soldiers who 'bravely brought Crimea into the Russian Empire,'"" and warned that Russia would always be prepared to defend the interests of Russian-speaking people, calling anyone in Russia who disagrees with him a ""traitor."" He has also referred to the break-up of Ukraine and Russia at the end of the Cold War as having created the largest divided nation in the world--a view that Allison argues reflects a ""new nationalist foreign policy"" that emphasizes Russia's ""natural bond with nations on its southern and eastern borders."" It is true that nations use myths about their history as cultural touchstones; these cultivate national identities and shape ""the face a nation wears to the world."" Russia's exceptional myths have been perpetuated throughout its history and post-Soviet Russia draws on previous notions of Russia's own manifest destiny that date back to czarist times, even as far back as Ivan the Terrible, who saw Russia as a ""Third Rome."" Consistent with this belief is the notion that Russia has an almost god-given duty to ""gather smaller ethnic groups around its core."" This is consistent with Gertjian Dijkink's idea of geopolitical vision, in which a sense of national mission is essential to ""preserve an historical heritage,"" an idea that seems applicable to Putin's understanding of Russia's connection with neighbouring lands. There is an abundance of scholarship on Russian foreign policy that has interpreted Putin's defence of Russia's cultural kinship in neighbouring states as little more than a cover for a power play--an attempt to roll back the boundaries of the new Europe as a way of resisting Western influence, possibly to soft- or hard-balance against Western interests. This view is not entirely discounted here; however, to discredit Putin's own ideational narrative about Russia's cultural and historical stewardship of Russian identity, within and adjacent to Russia, does a disservice to Russian foreign policy analysis. To reduce Putin's motives to naked geopolitics forecloses understanding of what animates Putin's foreign policy decisions; more importantly, perhaps, it precludes a proper appreciation for what his imagined vision of Russia's relations with its neighbours might be. If practice can in fact shape ideas, then Putin's success in Crimea may well confirm the salience of this narrative, ensuring its space in Russian strategic thinking. What follows is a brief review of some of the key analyses of Putin's so-called ""ideology,"" a label that this author cautions has been assumed to dominate foreign policy decisions. Interpreting Putin's words as ideology risks impeding foreign policy analysis because it presumes a filter for all decisions and that the actor will stop at nothing to promote that ideology. It is asserted here that Putin's narrative about Russian exceptionalism, its historical and cultural kinships, and its resistance of Western hegemony should be considered in the context of ideational narrative--a constructed identity that, while powerful, is fluid. What can be constructed can also be deconstructed. As actions can influence ideas, and they have, the reverse is also true. Failure to consider Russia's narrative in favour of labelling Putin a geopolitical opportunist with nostalgia for realpolitik is inadequate. With the end of the Cold War, the common Slavic state was disbanded. For Russia, this meant that it was now ""bereft of territories that had formed bridges with the rest of Europe. Ukraine was the symbol of old Kievan Russian with its orthodox roots."" Dmitry Shlapentokh identifies a trans-ethnic orthodoxy and Russian language and culture to form the roots of Russia's civilizational identity. Its latest iteration is characterized by statism and a siege mentality derived from the perception of Russia's hostile encirclement from the east and west and was born in an attempt to forge a Russian identity from the embers of the Soviet Union. Shlapentokh notes that Putin's efforts to create a Eurasian Economic Union reflect a desire to forge an alternate form of governance to the Western model, one that is uniquely Russian. However, rather than promoting a trans-ethnic culture , Byzantinism focuses on an entirely Russian orthodox culture, politically, economically, and socially statist, and it is this feature that makes people Russian, regardless of legal definitions of citizenship. Shlapentokh notes that this Russia will not succumb to division, will not be vulnerable to the internal battles of Western culture, and can stand as an alternative to the West. Putin's goal of ""sweeping away all that stands in the way of national development"" demonstrates his intention to reassert Russia's identity as a strong regional power with a strong state apparatus. Lilia Shevtsova highlights the value of Ukraine in the Russian political consciousness, notably because these two are ""historically interconnected"" and were once a single country; Russians are reluctant to set Ukraine free as a nation of distinct and separate peoples. Shevtsova claims that understanding this historical connection is essential to understanding what she calls ""the Putin Doctrine,"" which contains the following components: Russia is a special civilization, with traditional values undergirding a statist regime based on personalized power; Russia is the ""chief defender of Christianity and faith in God,"" needed because the West has turned its back on traditional religiosity; the EEU is a natural sphere of interest for Russia to which it is entitled; Russia has a duty to defend ""the Russian world"" ; and, Russia is an important counterbalance against liberalism, which should be ""contained."" Putin himself is seen as possessing his own Containment Doctrine of sorts, for which Ukraine has become ""the testing ground."" According to this logic, Russia is best understood as a ""revanchist state"" looking not to play by the rules but instead to create its own. Shevtsova argues that Putin interpreted the West's bluster over Ukraine as a bluff. He purposefully raised the stakes for the West to defend Ukraine and it blinked, which he anticipated, because he knows Western leaders do not wish to escalate the conflict with Russia. The Ukraine crisis showed Putin that he could assertively defend Russia's historical identity and connections with historical kin-countries. In a way, the West's response to his actions in Crimea served to legitimize Putin's narrative. Jeffrey Mankoff affirms Shevtsova's analysis, noting that Putin's push for Crimea is consistent with efforts to protect ethnic Russians in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh; but that Putin ""fans ethnic tensions"" in order to raise the stakes in areas of strategic importance. Mankoff argues that Russian willingness to go even further in Ukraine than it has done in the past signals that Putin is also willing to ""ratchet up his confrontation with the West."" Putin's ideology of exceptionalism is influencing his concerns about waning Russian influence in key places, and it reflects his growing concerns about the threat that the West presents. To this end, Putin has made efforts to destabilize neighbouring states by threatening their territorial integrity; whether this will continue to be an effective strategy in the long term, especially in light of Ukraine's post-Crimea pivot toward the West, remains to be seen. Returning to the identity argument, however, Mankoff is critical of the alleged need for Russia to care for ethnic Russians abroad because he feels it has been used selectively. Mankoff suggests that Putin has manufactured this pan-Slavic identity argument to support his desire to assert Russian dominance in strategically important areas only, not coincidentally in countries that have shown an interest in closer integration with Europe and toward which NATO, specifically, has made overtures. Closer Ukrainian integration with the EU could spell the end of Putin's ""Eurasian Dream,"" which envisions a bloc of post-Soviet countries--Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan--coming together under Russian dominance as the regional hegemon. Without Ukraine, Putin's strategic regional and economic goals are obstructed. This view aims to refute the notion that exceptionalism is driving Putin's actions in Ukraine, in favour of an economic and geopolitical explanation. Allison agrees that identity is not a persuasive rationale for taking parts of Ukraine by force, particularly when timing is considered. He argues that there was little to justify the urgency of Russia's response in spring 2014; after all, Russian identity did not really need protection as no Russian-speaking communities in Ukraine were under any real threat. Allison claims this rationale was given simply to provide a narrative that would justify extreme action. However, Allison strikes a tone similar to other analysts, unwilling to consider that Russian perceptions of a threat may be worth acknowledging. Putin has not changed his message since taking office in 2000. NATO --the West--has just failed to hear him. As further evidence that Putin has manufactured this issue about the vulnerability of Russian speakers in Ukraine, Allison offers the argument that, because this concern was not articulated under previous presidents, notably Yeltsin, when NATO expansion should have first become a concern to Russia, it is somehow negated. Allison claims that Moscow barely blinked when Crimea asserted its autonomy early in the 1990s, causing one Russian official to claim that Crimea is ""Ukraine's internal affair."" But Yeltsin was president at a very tumultuous time, when Russia's political system was not yet consolidated, when Russia's foreign policy priorities were inconsistent, and when Yeltsin himself was fighting for his political career amid extreme unpopularity and little confidence in shaky political institutions. Russian identity was in flux, as stability was prioritized over constructing a national identity from the wreckage of the Soviet Union. Moreover, that Russian opposition to NATO expansion grew under Putin only confirms the fluidity of Putin's ideational narrative. It has taken post-Soviet Russia some time to ""find itself,"" so to speak. Perhaps Russia is now finally in a position to understand its identity as it relates to its interests, and Putin's narrative, 20 years after the fall of the USSR, has captured Russia's emergent identity and its readiness to act on it. If we are to understand Russian foreign policy, it is essential to consider the motivations of Putin as he has himself articulated them. What follows is a consideration of Putin's actions in Crimea, viewed through this lens. The Crimea crisis, 2014 Russia's decision to annex Crimea during the 2014 Ukraine crisis revealed the extent to which Putin viewed Ukraine as a battleground in his efforts to protect Russian identity and kinship and to prevent Western dominance in the former Soviet space. These ideas, first expressed at Munich, are consistent with his narrative about the West's failure to manage the global security architecture and the need for an alternative. These ideas are encapsulated in his 18 March 2014 speech to the Russian Duma, following the Crimea referendum on unification with Russia. Putin noted, ""Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia,"" before articulating the reasons for its rightful return. Of the West's demands that Russia respect international law, he noted sarcastically, ""it is a good thing they at least remember that there exists such a thing as international law--better late than never."" Putin also referenced the ""Kosovo Precedent,"" drawing a parallel with Crimean independence, accusing the West of playing fast and loose with the selective application of international law. Invoking the Kosovo precedent, Putin challenged the West, notably the US, for proclaiming the legality, upheld by the UN International Court of Justice, of the unilateral separation of Kosovo from Serbia, and then denouncing Crimea for doing the very same. Crimea illustrated the nuanced Russian foreign policy taking shape, heavily influenced by ideas about Russian greatness and accompanied by a strident tone. Allison notes that Putin ""stepped up efforts to stake not just an economic, political or strategic division but a normative division, requiring states to choose between EU-centered and Russia-centered integration."" Michael McFaul underscores the influence of these ideas, which he claims compelled Putin to frame US support for the uprising against Viktor Yanukovich as a ""struggle between the US and Russia."" McFaul claims that this analytical framework caused Putin to react ""unilaterally in a way that he believed tilted the balance of power in his favor."" In fall 2013, growing pressure from the Kremlin led Yanukovich to withdraw from a popular trade deal with the EU. His decision met with angry protests, prompting Putin to negotiate a special deal with Yanukovich whereby Russia would purchase approximately $15 billion worth of Ukrainian debt and offer to sell natural gas to Ukraine at significantly reduced rates. Putin's efforts were clearly aimed at obstructing or reversing the Euromaidan movement that sought closer integration between Ukraine and Europe. This did little to stem popular protests, which continued through the February 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Just days after the closing ceremonies, Yanukovich was ousted by a coup d'état ; key government buildings in Simferopol, Crimea, were seized by pro-Russian forces. The Russian Duma supported Putin's request for the use of Russian military forces to help ""stabilize"" Ukraine. Shortly after the referendum in Crimea, Putin signed a decree recognizing Crimea as a sovereign and independent state. The Russian Duma recognized it as part of the Russian Federation on 18 March. At the time Putin noted, ""Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia in the hearts and minds of people."" Russia's involvement was disputed by all parties, with Western governments accusing the Kremlin of breaching Ukraine's sovereignty and of illegally instigating and supporting unrest in Crimea. Putin's actions were met with stern reprisal from Western leaders who slapped crippling economic sanctions and travel restrictions on key officials in Putin's government. Ukraine's newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, is decidedly pro-Western and has made overtures to forge strong Western partnerships for Ukraine. This has only exacerbated hostilities been Moscow and Western leaders. Allison notes that Russia's response in Crimea flouted international norms and that this could hurt it economically in the long term. However, these are the very norms Russia rejects, since if accepted they would serve as a legitimate constraint upon Russian power and interests. At the same time, these norms have served Putin well vis-à-vis the Ukraine crisis. The arguments Russia has used, in its own defence, have been constructed in response to these norms, and have played well domestically. After all, foreign policy is a recognized way to ""redress domestic order."" Putin has both rejected Western norms and then used these very norms to justify Russia's actions to Western critics. Allison confirms Putin's rejection of Western liberalism in order to ""consolidate Russian domestic opinion around leadership"" and also Putin's effectiveness in exploiting the West's own legal and normative discourse in defending his actions in Ukraine. Allison is inclined to discredit Putin's defence, implying instead a manufactured rationale designed to thwart a meaningful global response to Russia's actions and to bring Russia closer to its strategic goal of rebuilding its lost empire. Russia justified its incursion into Ukraine in several ways. First, the coup d'état that ousted President Yanukovich was illegitimate, as was the West's support for it: this violated Ukrainian sovereignty. Second, the human rights of the Russian-speaking minority in Crimea were threatened by an extreme nationalist agenda that sought to destabilize the country; Russia had a responsibility to protect Russians from targeted violence and also a responsibility to prevent a humanitarian crisis if Russian speakers were forced to flee the region. In fact, the Russian constitution legally vests the Russian president with the duty to ensure the well-being of Russians outside of Russia. Putin astutely invoked the lessons of Kosovo, an intervention championed by the West and which Russia was forced to live with, and which set a precedent for the importance of protecting civilians during political succession. Third, Putin argued that Russian military forces in Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet were under threat due to this same instability, constituting a strategic and immediate threat to Russian security, against which Russia had the legal right to defend itself according to Article 51 of the UN Charter; the US made a similar case for pre-emptive war as self-defence leading up to the Iraq War in 2003. And finally, Ukraine's legitimate, democratically elected government requested Russian assistance, which circumvents the need for UNSC sanctioned intervention. Allison claims that Putin's arguments served to create enough uncertainty within the international community around the facts of the intervention to render a punitive response to Russia less likely. However, the Western powers pushed back, arguing that Russia created an illegal situation by using the threat of force to influence the March 2014 referendum, and that the annexation of Crimea constituted a grave breach of contemporary international legal principles. But perhaps this was exactly the point Putin wished to make. Allison claims that Putin deliberately mounted an offence to Western criticisms using the very principles that underscore the liberal-dominated international legal order. This suggests that the Ukraine crisis was about more than simply Ukraine; it is emblematic of Putin's efforts to challenge the liberal order by providing an alternate reading of international law, given that the existing one is used selectively by the West. Allison views Putin's actions as revanchist in nature, aiming to reject the rules of the game in favour of a new set of rules, or interpretation of the rules, dictated not by the West but by all major powers, including Russia. In this vein, Russia saw the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity--including Crimea--as a moral and political victory because only 52 percent of member states supported this resolution. Putin accused the US of following ""the law of the gun,"" or selectively interpreting and applying international law, and of finding ways to make its own aggressions seem legitimate, all the while standing in judgment of Russia. Dunn and Bobick note that ""Putin satirizes the ideology that the United States and Western Europe have used to justify invading sovereign states, eviscerating it as a moral standpoint... Putin uses the pervasive fear created by these frozen conflicts to constitute a new form of post-Soviet liminality that challenges international law, humanitarian intervention and the rules of the international system."" This relates back to Putin's own views of exceptionalism and Russia's need to claim its rightful place as an international leader and a regional power whose hegemony has been threatened by the assumption of Western liberal dominance. Russia can present an important alternative and can do so by using the West's own rules--its liberal internationalist regimes and norms--against it. It is easy to be critical of Putin's use of the West's own rhetoric to justify his actions in Ukraine, actions which had tragic consequences. However, some of his justifications may not be unreasonable. He is not the first to criticize the West--notably the US--for applying international law selectively and for using the mechanisms of global power to benefit its own interests. Realist scholars have long been proclaiming that all great powers can be expected to behave this way. Putin sees himself as projecting Russian power and interests assertively, but not without justification. And it is this justification that is essential to a full analysis of Russian foreign policy. Putin has been very clear since taking office in 2000 that he sees Russia as a great power deserving of respect and manoeuvrability with regard to its national interests. Putin's narrative has revolved around how Western nations, especially the US, have denied Russia the respect to which it is entitled, at nearly every turn; viewed this way, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Russia--and Putin--responded. In many ways it is because of the perception of the West's denial of Russian power, and a failure to recognize Russia's interest in protecting its unique cultural and historical relationships with its neighbours, that Putin's narrative has taken shape. His actions in Crimea reflect these ideas and this enables Putin's leadership to thrive. Putin has shaped a Russian identity that encompasses a stronger Russia, enabled by a strong state, with a strong president stewarding Russia's revival--in the near and far abroad. Conclusion The task of ""understanding Putin"" is a challenging one and it is easy to fall into old habits when analyzing Russian foreign policy. After all, Putin is a leader who employs harsh rhetoric and who has boldly asserted Russian power on the world stage. The tendency to reduce Putin to a practitioner of realpolitik requires a number of assumptions. These include acknowledging the presence of an inherent competition between Russia and the West, assigning ""old school"" logic to Putin's ""power plays,"" taking a structural view of his motives, and advocating the ""containment"" of Russia in response. If Putin's ideology is one of geopolitical revanchism, if a ""Putin Doctrine"" exists and is characterized by a smokescreen to forcibly take back what is rightfully Russia's, then this leaves little room for discussion. These postulations are not devoid of analytical value; however, this paper has attempted to go beyond them, beyond the dominant assumptions within the field of Russian foreign policy analysis. To truly understand Putin requires that we consider seriously his constructed narrative about Russian identity, shaped in part by its perception of the West's neglect and denial of its power, and by its exceptional connection to its Russian kin in the borderlands. The ideas Putin has himself articulated are the result of, and have themselves emboldened, an identity for post-Soviet Russia, some 25 years on, that is informing Russian foreign policy, as evidenced by its 2014 actions in Ukraine. Rather than delegitimizing his words as a cover for nefarious intent, they should be valued for what they are: a way to explain and understand Russia's priorities and its actions. The more successful Putin is at building this narrative, and the more it takes root within Russia, the more likely it will be to inform future action. We may also see more muscle flexing if and when the interests of ethnic Russians in nearby lands are perceived to be threatened, and there may be an appetite for their protection among Russians, which Putin may seize upon. Many of the leading analyses discussed above caution against acknowledging Putin's desire to protect Russian speakers and to hold a region of historical brethren together because this risks legitimizing his use of force, his apparently revisionist characterization of sovereignty, and the regional insecurities this has caused. Likewise there is a reluctance to give any credence to Putin's humanitarian claims as a justification for the use of military force to protect Russians in Crimea, or to his assertion that Russia is culturally and historically duty-bound to do so and to provide an alternative to the presumptive leadership of the West. Allison notes that public demonstrations against Putin's regime in recent years--notably in winter 2011 and spring 2012, the timing of which worryingly coincided with the Arab spring, which saw the popular ousting of authoritarian regimes in Tunisia and Egypt--forced Putin to consolidate his leadership. In other words, in addition to geopolitics, Putin's actions in Crimea are also considered a means to strengthen his personal power by stirring up nationalist fervour, casting Putin as Russia's great defender against external foes. Perhaps this does partly explain the timing of Putin's actions; however, if there were not already an appetite for the assertion of Russian exceptionalism, and the need to protect and unite ethnic Russians, buttressed by a sense of historical connectedness, then this narrative would not be so effective for Putin. Russians are, and have always been, hungry for a strong leader, and the siege mentality, albeit stoked by Putin, is real. Putin has seized upon this, and put voice to it, but to suggest it is entirely manufactured is, in this author's judgment, misguided. Putin received a 96 percent approval rating after annexing Crimea in March 2014. Failure to seriously consider his narrative, and the subsequent rationale for action, means we also fail to understand Putin and the power of ideas in shaping history. Putin's ideational narrative has been shaped by, and shapes, a discourse about cultural and historical ties with Russian borderlands, as well as by the cultural and security vulnerabilities generated by the West's treatment of Russia, evidenced by the expansion of NATO. This discourse has underscored a more militant foreign policy turn under Putin in which he is prepared to protect and defend Russia's interests at high cost; Russia's actions in Crimea exemplify this. This paper has suggested that ideas shape, and are shaped by, events. Putin has constructed an ideational narrative that underscores his actions in Crimea. While these actions are worthy of criticism, they are also worthy of understanding if we hope to gain a better grasp of Russian foreign policy under his leadership.

9a0f7bcb-b90f-42e2-a160-82fd5548843c,"Jan 31 - Russia is calling on Ukraine to stop acts of provocation in Donbas and expects the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to take prompt steps to de-escalate the situation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. ""We are calling on the Ukrainian authorities to immediately stop armed provocations in Donbas, adhere to the existing truce agreements, and finally start the responsible implementation of all provisions of the Minsk Package of Measures, including those concerning political aspects of the existing problems,"" the ministry said in a statement posted on its official website. ""We expect prompt steps from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission deployed in Ukraine to de-escalate the situation as soon as possible,"" it said. Moscow also expects ""Ukraine's partners to exert proper influence on Kyiv to make it abandon the attempts to take military revenge in Donbas and dash the Minsk Agreements,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The escalation of the conflict in Donbas is ""a direct result of the continued violation by Ukraine of its obligations under the Minsk Agreements, which nobody in Kyiv is going to implement,"" the Foreign Ministry said. ""Instead of efforts toward achieving a sustainable peace, the Ukrainian authorities are stubbornly pursuing a military solution to the conflict. We would like to recall how such reckless affairs ended for them earlier,"" it said. In addition, ""the southeastern part of Ukraine, which has suffered from Kyiv's economic blockade as it was, is again on the verge of a real humanitarian and environmental disaster,"" it said. ""A strange 'pattern' is also inevitably evident. Any deterioration in the situation in Donbas has surprisingly coincided with the Ukrainian leadership's foreign trips. It looks like it intends so to perpetuate the crisis on the international agenda provoked by Kyiv itself,"" it said.

103498b7-32eb-45c6-9dd5-3bbb968a1487,"The dismemberment of the Soviet Union prompted a very unstable decade of decline for Russia, and generated numerous conflicts in the post-Soviet space. Russia regained influence at global and, chiefly, regional level from 2000, after Vladimir Putin became president and the price of hydrocarbons rose. Arguably, energy policy played an essential role. The South Caucasus, where three secessionist conflicts took place, leading to Russian political, diplomatic and military intervention, was crucial for the Russian geo-energy interests. This article examines and discusses the impact of intervention on Russian geo-energy interests, in particular since Putin came to power. The working hypothesis proposes that Russia's involvement in the three secessionist conflicts in the South Caucasus has considerably benefited the many Russian geo-energy interests. Keywords: secessionist conflicts, South Caucasus, energy policy, hydrocarbons, geo-energy interests Following the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , the Russian Federation remains an energy superpower. However, in the 1990s the country experienced a decade of instability and decline during which its international influence and, more troubling for Russia, regional influence declined. The dissolution of the USSR also coincided with surplus crude oil on the world market in combination with price stability and suppression. Consequently, energy became less prominent as a traditional Russian tool of influence. This occurred in conjunction with the Russian state's loss of control over the country's energy sector. From 2000, Russia began to regain global and, more importantly, regional influence with President Putin's rise to power, recovering oil prices from 1998 , and the start of the Second Gulf War. Two decades later, it is claimed that ""the Russian foreign and security policy framework is characterised by a regional power that is striving to reacquire the global power it enjoyed during the Soviet era"" . Russia's energy policy is the cornerstone upon which this recovery rests. It has two interrelated functions: an internal function, which essentially involves the practice of ""energy nationalism"", and an external function , which concerns Russian influence in three regions: post-Soviet Europe, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. These regions compose Russia's ""near abroad"" or ""sphere of influence"" and include the fourteen former Soviet republics. The term South Caucasus is politically neutral and more geographically accurate than Transcaucasia. The term in its classical sense refers to the region formed by Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet republics that became independent states in 1991. Historically, the South Caucasus has been vital to Russian national interests. For two centuries, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia were part of the Tsarist Empire and then the USSR. Russia's post-Soviet relations with the South Caucasus have been heavily influenced by its geo-energy interests and intervention in unresolved secessionist conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh . These are recognised as ""frozen conflicts"", territorial and ethnic disputes arising after the disintegration of the USSR that create multiple risks and threats. The Russian-Georgian war of 2008 demonstrated the fragility of the security system in this region and in nearby states . Although there are many unresolved territorial tensions in the South Caucasus , the conflicts over South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh have a secessionist character, where de facto independent territories have emerged out of armed conflicts, although without international recognition. In the context of Russian energy policy, one central strategy adopted to obtain geo-energy benefits in the post-Soviet South Caucasus has involved intervening in these conflicts politically, economically and militarily. In turn, expanding Russia's regional influence necessitates the implementation of this energy policy. Hence, this strategy reinforces itself. Over the last two decades, researchers have discussed this strategy and analysed conflict in the post-Soviet South Caucasus . However, while the South Caucasus is central to Russian geo-energy interests, and although Russia's intervention in such conflicts is evident, two areas for improvement have been detected in the literature, including literature focusing on energy issues . First, a direct, specific and clear connection in terms of concrete benefits is missing between Russia's intervention in the three secessionist conflicts in the South Caucasus and the defence of Russian geo-energy interests. Second, a comprehensive and organised presentation of such benefits has not been accomplished, particularly since Putin's rise to power. This article aims to address these limitations. The following question summarises the research problem: How has Russian intervention in the three post-Soviet secessionist conflicts in the South Caucasus affected Russian geo-energy interests? Our hypothesis is that Russia's intervention in the three post-Soviet secessionist conflicts in the South Caucasus has greatly benefited its geo-energy interests. Post-Soviet Russia's Geo-energy Interests and Regional Influence: The Importance of the South Caucasus Russia is a quintessential energy superpower. The country is self-sufficient in energy, and its immense energy resources represent one of its main geopolitical strengths. This article focuses on oil and gas resources. Fossil fuels dominate the global energy mix, and remain this century's main energy supply . Russia alternates with Saudi Arabia as the main global oil producer and with Iran as the country with the largest proven gas reserves . Russia may also possess the largest reseives of shale oil, and has the ninth-largest reserves of shale gas . Russia supplies Europe with approximately one-third of its oil and gas needs and increasingly supplies oil to East Asia. Approximately 50 percent of the state's revenues come from energy, but ""the energy sector is far more than a commercial asset for Moscow; it has been one of the pillars of Russia's stabilisation and increasing strength for more than a century"" . Moreover, even though the ""instrumentálisadon of power for political purposes is a well-known strategy in Russia and goes back to Soviet times , with Putin's arrival to power, a policy was established to restore Russia's influence - increase its power - in neighbouring regions but also beyond. It is also the case that this has been based on its energy capacity"" (translated from Sánchez Ortega 2014, 234). Russia's energy policy possesses the two features described. Domestically, Russia has practiced energy nationalism, which is also practiced in Venezuela and Algeria (Mané 2006). This has been accompanied by highly coercive measures focussing on control of pipelines, and by the expeditious and opaque nature of Russian approaches to political power . The state has asserted control over virtually the entire Russian gas sector through its state-owned monopoly Gazprom, and since 2003 the oil sector has undergone a process of disguised renationalisation through the creation of state-owned companies and state-linked private companies . With respect to external energy policies, Russia has manipulated energy to alter the balance of power in neighbouring regions: post-Soviet Europe, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Russia has maintained its dominant position in the European market, the dependency on former European Soviet republics, and control over pipeline systems that run from post-Soviet Europe to Western Europe. Similarly, it has managed to maintain its position as the main export route for oil and gas from Central Asia. However, it is precisely in the South Caucasus, and particularly in Georgia, that Russia's strategy may be most threatened. The South Caucasus, a globally significant geopolitical and geostrategic region, is bordered to the north by the troubled North Caucasus ; to the south by Turkey and Iran ; to the west by the Black Sea; and to the east by the Caspian Sea. As highlighted by Batalla : ""the Caucasus, the backyard of the Tsars, whether white or red, is considered by Vladimir Putin's Russia as the sphere of influence that will again make Russia great in a global context"". Additionally, the South Caucasus is particularly relevant within the Caucasus as a whole, given its critical geo-energy importance. The region is of great interest to Russia for two fundamental reasons: a) The region is very rich in proven hydrocarbon reserves, but these reserves are distributed unevenly. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in May 2013 Azerbaijan's proven reserves were 7 billion barrels of oil and 35 trillion cubic feet of gas, while Georgia possessed 40 million bbl and 300,000 million cf, respectively. Azerbaijan produced 921,750 bbl per day and 606,560 million cf of gas annually . Georgia produced 1,000 bbl/d and 200 million cf of gas annually but is a net importer of oil and gas . For its part, Armenia, which is devoid of hydrocarbon assets, buys nearly 100 percent of its domestically consumed gas and oil from Russia (2billion cubic meters and 50,000 bbl/d in 2013 . b) The existence of these reserves and the pipeline system built during the Soviet period, which runs from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, in addition to recent geopolitical conflicts, continue to encourage major investments in pipeline-building and maintenance (Morales Hernández 2004, 2). This trend will become even more prominent as production grows, as in the case of the Caspian Shah Deniz gas fields , Azerbaijan's largest deposit. The South Caucasus is crossed by four strategic pipelines that are primarily directed towards Europe: three oil pipelines and one gas pipeline. Given its presence in the South Caucasus, this infrastructure provides Russia with an instrument for exerting pressure over the West. However, the gas pipeline and two of the three oil pipelines are owned and operated by Western companies and do not cross Russian territory, enabling the export of Azerbaijani resources and thus allowing Georgia to mitigate its energy dependence on Russia. Hence, Russia has a strong interest in maintaining and strengthening its influence in the South Caucasus, and particularly in Georgia, and in opposing the construction of offshore pipelines through the Caspian Sea so that extracted resources are transported by land . The four strategic pipelines are: a) The Baku-Novorossiysk Oil Pipeline completed in 1996, which can transport up to 105,000 bbl/d over 1,330 kilometres from Azerbaijan to the Russian oil terminal of Novorossiysk . b) The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Main Export Oil Pipeline , which was built to rival the Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline and took advantage of Russia's weak state In the 1990s. Also completed in 2006, It can transport up to one million bbl/d of crude oil from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean and from there to Europe In oil tankers. The pipeline Is 1,768 kilometres long, crossing Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. Although companies Involved In its construction considered other, more efficient routes, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey and especially the United States asserted domestic interests to select this final route. c) The Western Route Export Pipeline completed in 1999 transports crude oil from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea and from there in oil tankers to Europe, over. The 829-kilometre route begins In Azerbaijan, crosses Georgia, and terminates at the Supsa Terminal In Georgia. d) The Baku-Tblllsi-Erzurum Gas Pipeline completed In 2007 can transport up to 20,000 million cm of gas annually 980 kilometres from the Caspian Sea to Erzurum, Turkey, following the same route as the BTC oil pipeline. The BTE gas pipeline may in future connect with Turkmenistan via the offshore Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline pipeline project. In this sense, the South Caucasus, and Azerbaijan in particular, represents a potential corridor to Central Asia and East Asia. In fact, the West urges the South Caucasus to host pipeline projects that may In the future form a Fourth Corridor, which would be designed to reduce dependence on Russian gas and gas pipelines Importing Azerbaijani gas and Turkmen and Kazakh gas through pipelines that cross the Caspian Sea and continue through Azerbaijan and Georgia towards Europe. However, in orderio accomplish this, Russia would need to unblock the building of offshore pipelines In the Caspian Sea, which Is highly unlikely, as this would contradict Russian geo-energy Interests . Pipeline-building would thus require an agreement between the five countries that likely would not Include Russia, which Is Interested in operating pipelines that cross its own territory. As part of Fourth Corridor framework, various gas pipeline projects Involving different routes and destinations have been proposed, with Azerbaijan and the European Union favouring some more than others: Nabucco, the South-East Europe Pipeline , the Turkey-Greece-ltaly Interconnector , the White Stream and the currently most viable Trans Adriatic Pipeline , initially proposed by the United States and led by British Petroleum and the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic . The oldest and most ambitious and expensive proposal Is the Nabucco project, which would Initially connect Erzurum with Austria but could then be connected to the BTE gas pipeline and thus Turkmenistan and Iran . Russia prefers Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan to sell gas to Russia, as demonstrated by President Medvedev, who attempted to persuade his two counterparts on this issue as one of his first foreign policy actions. Currently, however, the Nabucco project Is still infeasible, mainly due to doubts surrounding the availability of sufficient Azerbaijani gas. This requirement also Implies that only smaller projects connected to Azerbaijan are viable within the Fourth Corridor: TAP and perhaps SEEP, a smallerverslon of Nabucco. The plan is also Impractical at present for geopolitical reasons and due to a lack of strong EU support; the existence of the rival Russian South Stream project, which Is highly advanced and will occupy the floor of the Black Sea; the project's high cost; and the absence of a prominent Western company In upstream Turkmenistan to lobby for the deal. The White Stream project is much less strategic, as it involves transporting gas through Ukraine and requires an expensive connection with Georgia via the Black Sea. Concerning ITGI and TAP - rival projects for gas transport to Greece and Italy - in 2013 the Greek crisis caused Azerbaijan and the consortium that operates Shah Deniz to select the TAP for transporting gas to Europe. The first section of the TAP will run through Azerbaijan and Georgia, thus acting as an extension of the BTE gas pipeline, and will connect with a second section in Turkey: the Trans Anatolian Pipeline . This arrangement will finally provide a connection to Greece and Italy. Russian Intervention in the South Caucasus Conflicts: Geo-energy Benefits Currently, only Azerbaijan and Armenia are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States , and only Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation . Although their relations are not free from tension, Armenia has traditionally acted as Russia's stable and strategic partner in the South Caucasus for reasons that go beyond the mere fact that their populations are largely Christian and of Indo-European ethnicity. Armenia needs Russian troops to remain in its territory , and given Armenia's inability to guarantee the security of its borders, Russian border guards monitor its borders with Turkey and especially Iran. Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan are conditioned by Azerbaijani energy capacities and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Although Azerbaijan is not Russia's partner, relations between the two countries have improved in recent years. Compared to Russian-Georgian relations, which broke down in 2008 following the war and Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, relations have changed only marginally. The present article does not intend to elaborate on the origins and development of the three conflicts but rather to explain Russian intervention and to show how Russia's willingness and ability to intervene have been favoured by certain characteristics of these conflicts and by regional and geopolitical dynamics. The three conflicts are polyhedral and operate within global geopolitics, as clearly exhibited by the presence of important stakeholders aside from Russia , whose interests have often collided (Askari and Taghavi 2006; Cornell 2001; Demirbaş 2010; Koolaee and Hafezian 2010). Each of the three conflicts possesses endogenous and exogenous components. All three have been defined in different ways since the late 1980s; initial designation as ethnic conflicts was followed by redesignation as ethnopolitical and political-ethnic conflicts; some authors have also treated them as conflicts between states without ethnic motivations while others deem them territorial conflicts. As noted by Rusetsky , ""the inadequate perception of the content and sociology of the conflicts is one of the basic and legally fundamental causes of their unsolvable nature"". The South-Caucasus Institute of Regional Security argues that each conflict has followed the same evolutionary pattern and provides an understanding of how the conceptualisation and definition of these conflicts attracted Russian intervention, and the reason for the inability to reach satisfactory and definitive agreements - which benefits Russia. According to SCIRS, conflicts first arose between various parties. Next, parallel pseudo-conflicts emerged that deepened these conflicts by exacerbating, modifying or suppressing true motivations and incorporating players who were allegedly involved or interested in the conflicts . Pseudoconflicts artificially fostered the ethnic component of political conflict and a resurgence of interest in the historical origins, thus ethnically essentialising these originally political conflicts. This fostered ethnic hatred and led to the third phase, in which actors that are actually contributing to the conflict are postulated as mediators and peacemakers between alleged rival ethnic or nationalist groups. Georgians, South Ossetians and Abkhazians are primarily, in ethnic terms, Georgians, Ossetians and Abkhazians, respectively . Approximately 75 percent of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh is Christian and ethnically Armenian, while Azerbaijan is predominantly Muslim and ethnically Azeri. However, these differences alone do not explain the occurrence of conflict or the interests of these and other actors in perpetuating both the conflicts themselves and pseudo-conflicts in order to obtain benefits and achieve a standby or quasi-peace phase, which is nearly completely subordinate to Russia's geo-energy interests. This quasi-peace inhibits the true resolution of real conflict and the materialisation of real peace. Consequently, as Alexander Rusetsky states: ""the development paradigm of the Caucasian conflicts is oriented toward the side of the crisis and not toward the side of regulation"" , as is shown in the following section. Georgia: South Ossetia and Abkhazia In 1990, the Georgian region of South Ossetia declared itself independent as the Republic of South Ossetia, to which the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic responded by abolishing its autonomous status. In 1991, Georgia was recognised as an independent state, and territorial tensions heightened in South Ossetia. In January 1991, Georgian troops attempted to enter the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali and started a war in which Russia supported South Ossetian. The war ended with the defeat of Georgia and the signing of the Dagomis Agreements between Russia and Georgia in July 1992, which made Russia responsible for ensuring the security of both parties and established a security corridor through Georgia for Russian troops. After Abkhazia unilaterally declared itself an independent region of Georgia in September 1992, fighting erupted between Georgian troops and Russian-Abkhaz paramilitaries, which occupied much of Abkhazia, including the capital Sukhumi. The fighting persisted until 1993. In 1994, Russian peacekeepers were deployed, this time under the direction of the CIS . In 1992, the majority of South Ossetians voted in favour of joining Russia, and this began to encourage secessionism and the delivery of aid and troops from North Ossetia . After 1995, tensions between Georgia and South Ossetia intensified with recurring clashes, and more fighting broke out in Abkhazia in 1998 and 2001. In 2006, a majority of South Ossetians voted for independence in a referendum deemed illegal by Georgia. In July ofthat year, the Georgian parliament called for an end to Russian peacekeeping operations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and for the replacement of Russian peacekeeping troops with international police contingents. The Georgian parliament considered the presence of Russian troops to be a major obstacle to a peaceful resolution and warned that the troops would be viewed as an occupying force if they refused to leave. In 2006, Georgian forces occupied Upper Abkhazia, and in 2007, Georgia created the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia. The independence of Kosovo in 2008, which Russia rejected, deepened Russia's special bilateral relationships with South Ossetia and Abkhazia and its political and financial support of both regions. In April 2008, Putin announced that Russia would grant preferential treatment to both regions and act as a defender of the rights, freedoms and interests of their populations. Russia expanded social benefits for these populations . Georgia, meanwhile, accused Russia of backing the breakaway regions and intending to grant Russian citizenship en masse to their inhabitants, thus ""silently"" annexing them. On the evening of 7 August 7 2008, Georgian troops invaded and bombed South Ossetia , which automatically provoked a Russian intervention in Georgia in defence of the two regions and the cessation of a similar Georgian operation in Abkhazia . Russia, claiming to be conducting peaceful operations, responded militarily to Georgia and entered its first interstate conflict since Soviet times: the Russian-Georgian war of 8-12 August 2008. Russia defeated Georgia and expelled Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, with which it immediately established diplomatic relations and recognised as sovereign states. Russia maintains military bases with thousands of troops in both territories and claims that this action is justified by the need for peace operations, by the fact that the Russian legal system requires the defence of Russian citizens wherever they are, and by agreements signed with both territories for mutual assistance in cases of external aggression {de facto protectorates that Russia may annex at any time). This war established Russia as a prominent player in the South Caucasus. Geo-energy Benefits for Russia Russia's intervention in secessionist conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, especially after the 2008 war, has brought it significant geo-energy benefits. Specifically, Russia has strengthened and increased its presence in Georgia, greatly weakening a state that is very refractory to Russian interests . Georgia holds a key strategic position in South Caucasus energy corridors and provides the only real alternative to the Russian pipeline system for transporting oil and gas from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. Even Russian gas that reaches Armenia is carried through a pipeline that runs through Georgia. Following the war of 2008, Russia acquired complete control over the Abkhaz coast to strengthen the already massive presence of its naval fleet in the Black Sea and to control the flow of hydrocarbons and the Abkhaz continental shelf and its deposits , as well as to acquire significant income by signing contracts to build energy networks. To the detriment of the Caspian Sea area, Russia has managed to strengthen the Black Sea area in order to control strategic regional pipelines and block access to the Black Sea. It has also managed to exert more direct control over pipelines that connect Azerbaijan with the South Caucasus, Russia, and Iran. Russia has also prevented the creation of new pipelines through the South Caucasus and Georgia avoiding Russian territory. In the war of 2008, Russia largely destroyed the Georgian army, which protected the oil pipelines, as well as the main commercial port , which included an oil terminal and which was crucial to the East-West corridor . Russia has also tightened its control over rail transport of oil in the South Caucasus (since the closure of the Abkhaz-Georgian border, Russian oil enters Georgia through the Black Sea and is transported to Armenia Similarly, to the detriment of the Caspian Sea area, Russia has managed to strengthen the Black Sea as a transport corridor to promote the advancement of its South Stream project. In 2009, Gazprom inaugurated the DzuarikauTskhinvali gas pipeline, which connects Russia and the South Ossetian capital. Russia has succeeded in forcing Kazakhstan to cancel major investments in energy infrastructure in Georgia and, despite US efforts, has prevented the planning of new pipelines to link Central Asia with the South Caucasus and the South Caucasus with Western countries avoiding Russian territory . Hence, Russia has prevailed as the major transit corridor for current and future pipelines and resisted US and European efforts to ensure that essential import routes from Central Asia avoid Russian territory, and to and limit their dependence on Russia. Despite the importance of the South Caucasus to the West, this situation has been reinforced through the crisis in Ukraine, which is a vital source of EU gas imports via pipelines from Russia. These processes have prevented Georgia, an ally of the United States, from joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Even before the 2008 war, Germany and France vetoed Georgia's accession, citing among other reasons the existence of such problems. In turn, Russia has distanced the South Caucasus from the United States , which possesses its own geo-energy interests in the region . Finally, with the 2008 war, Russia indirectly warned those states with territorial tensions within its sphere of influence that collaborating with NATO orthe Ell could harm Russian geo-energy interests . Furthermore, in recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign states, Russia indirectly informed Armenia and Azerbaijan that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict will follow Russian interests and signalled Azerbaijan that Russia may also recognise Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia-Azerbaijan: Nagorno-Karabakh In 1923, the USSR made Nagorno-Karabakh part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Shortly before the demise of the USSR, Armenia and Azerbaijan began to confront each other in this territory. In 1988, the Nagorno-Karabakh parliament sought reunification with Armenia. In 1990, there were massacres of Armenians in Azerbaijan and clashes between Azeri nationalists and Russian troops. In 1991, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh were declared sovereign states, and in 1991-1992, Azerbaijan attacked secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia responded, and in 1993-1994 took control of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani districts . In 1993, Armenia belonged to the CSTO in the CIS framework, as did Azerbaijan . Although Russia was officially neutral in the conflict, it supplied arms to both sides. In May 1994, a ceasefire sponsored by Russia came into effect, although peace talks held since have failed to resolve the conflict . Armenia considers Nagorno-Karabakh an independent state that should be present in the peace talks of the OSCE Minsk Group, which is composed of Russia, the United States, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Turkey. According to Azerbaijan, Armenia must withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azerbaijani territories, and the return of refugees and displaced persons should be allowed. Azerbaijan maintains an economic embargo against Armenia, as does Turkey and Iran . Lacking oil and gas resources and access to the sea, Armenia is thus dependent on having a powerful ally such as Russia to ensure its survival and national identity and to provide the population with a certain degree of welfare through state aid and Russian business investments. In 1997, Russia and Armenia signed a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. However, throughout the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russia has not positioned itself against energy-rich Azerbaijan, which is strategically placed across energy corridors. Since 1991, Russia has attempted to maintain a calculated and complex balance between Armenia and Azerbaijan while favouring its own geo-energy interests. For example, Russia supplied weapons to both sides. On this issue, the International Institute for Strategic Studies stated that Russia was striking a new balance in its relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. For example, after a meeting between President Medvedev and the Azerbaijani President in September 2010, to continue improving traditionally frosty relations between the two states, unofficial sources reported a significant delivery of Russian weaponry to Azerbaijan; however, Russian-Azerbaijani relations are not without residual tensions, as demonstrated in late 2012 by the failure of negotiations to renew the lease of Russia's Liaki-2 radarstation installed in Azerbaijan in 1985, after Russia rejected Azerbaijan's conditions. However, in August 2010, Russia signed new military agreements with Armenia that have expanded the supply of Russian weapons and the direct involvement of Russian troops in support of Armenia's security. Additionally, Armenia will allow Russia to keep its 102nd Military Base in Gyumri until 2044 , which has acquired greater importance throughout the South Caucasus and which is regarded as a guarantee of Armenian security against Azerbaijan and Turkey. Using this strategy, Russia simultaneously pressured Azerbaijan and Armenia to cease hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh, defended its interests, strengthened its presence in the South Caucasus's security and relational system, and increased revenues through the sale of weapons . After Medvedev developed a negotiating agenda to resolve the conflict with unusual intensity in 2008-2011 , Putin resumed strategies to maintain a complex balance that intensified tensions between the two states, in geo-energy terms benefiting Russia. For example, days after Putin announced relevant trade agreements with Azerbaijan in 2013 , Armenia, concerned that Russia would increase the supply of arms to Azerbaijan, which has not renounced its military occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, announced its entry into the Customs Union of Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan. Thus, Armenia forwent its impending Association Agreement with the EU . In December 2013, Putin announced a price reduction forgas, petroleum products and weaponry supplied to Armenia. The conflict resolution protocol of the Minsk Group requires that Armenia return the seven districts surrounding NagornoKarabakh to Azerbaijan, allow this territory provisional status that ensures its security and self-government, maintain a corridor that physically connects Nagorno-Karabakh's territory with Armenia through Azerbaijan, hold a binding referendum on its final status, and allow the return of refugees and displaced persons. However, Armenia and Azerbaijan do not agree on the protocol's implementation, and so far the only advance is that the parties seem to have accepted the practical impossibility of resolving the conflict militarily. Therefore, Nagorno-Karabakh may: a) Maintain its current status or a similar status: formally Azerbaijani territory but de facto independent and closely linked to Armenia. b) Become integrated into Armenia. c) Become a sovereign state but supervised by Armenia and, above all, by Russia. d) Return to Azerbaijani sovereignty. The first scenario is the most favourable for Russia because any other outcome would require it to intervene militarily to support Armenia against Azerbaijan, where it has many geoenergy interests. In fact, Russian intervention in the conflict has always aimed at maintaining the status quo. Although it is unlikely that the parties will reach an agreement, Russia insists on resolving the conflict through dialogue and reserves the right to intervene militarily if any party employs the use of force . However, as in the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Rusetsky observes: Russia is part of the conflict. Although Russia maintains military cooperation with Azerbaijan and Armenia at the same time, the asymmetry of the conflict is evident both legally and militarily, because Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Additionally, the Russian Federation will be interested in regulating the conflict only if it regains complete control of the region's situation. As a party to the conflict, Russia cannot play the role of intermediary. Additionally, the Abkhaz variant is not excluded, where Russia, being part of the conflict, became active and occupied Georgian territory. Geo-energy Benefits for Russia With respect to Azerbaijan, the current scenario allows Russia to refrain from antagonising a state that is so critical to transportation systems and hydrocarbon reseives by continuing to consider for Azerbaijan the option to regain Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven districts. Russia prevents Azerbaijan from expanding its relations with Turkey, while Azerbaijan also blocks Iranian Influence In the South Caucasus. However, Russia has also Informed Azerbaijan that a conflict resolution that favourable to Azerbaijan's Interests will only be possible If Azerbaijan does not harm Russian geo-energy interests, for example by constructing offshore pipelines In the Caspian Sea. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan prefers to exploit Its own resources, rather than being a transit state for Turkmen gas. Azerbaijan's support of building the WREP and BTC oil pipelines caused Russia to reject Azerbaijan as a partner . However, Russian pressure largely explains why Azerbaijan and the consortium that operates Shah Deniz field chose in June 2013 to transport gas to Europe via the TAP in place of the Nabucco West route . Azerbaijan and companies that operate within this field hold important interests in Russia, and the TAP project was chosen because it will not supply gas to states with high dependence on Russian gas. In this context of developing Russian-Azerbaijani energy relations,, SOCAR and Russia's Rosneft agreed a joint venture in August 2013, and SOCAR announced plans to transport Russian oil through the BTC oil pipeline in the near future and to reverse the flow of the Baku-Novorossiysk oil pipeline to transport Russian oil to Azerbaijan. To the extent that the BTC oil pipeline is intended to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil and transport routes through Russian territory, this could entail a major shift in the geo-energy outlook of the South Caucasus. Russia has taken advantage of the fact that Azerbaijan's oil production and revenues have decreased in recent years by offering the possibility of capitalising more on the transmission of oil through the BTC oil pipeline, which would be fed with Russian oil. Russia has also taken advantage of decreased activity in Azerbaijani oil refineries by offering to provide Russian oil through the Baku-Novorossiysk oil pipeline . In addition, by keeping the Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia conflicts frozen, Russia has managed to sow doubts over the construction of the TAP and other pipelines that cross the South Caucasus or those being planned that intend to avoid Russian territory, which may support military objectives. As already noted, no pipeline currently crosses Armenia due to strained ArmenianAzerbaijani relations, and this also benefits Russian geoenergy interests. With regards to Armenia, by maintaining the current status of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia has managed to maintain a historical ally while also distancing it from the Ell, because although Russia does not explicitly support the formal independence of Nagorno-Karabakh or its annexation by Armenia, it tolerates the de facto independence of secessionist, pro-Armenian territory as well as Armenian control over the seven Azerbaijani districts. However, for the reasons stated, throughout the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict Russia has not positioned itself against Azerbaijan as Armenia wished, though Armenia must remain loyal to Russia to continue to exist as a state. In addition, like Azerbaijan, Russia has informed Armenia that a conflict resolution strategy favourable to Armenian interests will only be possible if Armenia does not infringe upon Russian geo-energy interests. Russia has even managed to involve Armenia in the RussianGeorgian conflict, which has been intensified by the existence of the Gyumri military base near Georgia. Russian pressures have prevented Iranian-Armenian negotiations on hydrocarbons from prospering . Russia has also ensured that Armenia will continue to buy virtually all of its gas and oil from Russia. From 2014 to 2018, Russia will supply Armenia with 2billion cm annually, representing approximately 350 million euros per year despite price reductions in 2013. In January 2014, Gazprom acquired 100 percent of the shares of its Armenian equivalent, ArmRosgazprom , which was renamed Gazprom Armenia . Russia holds considerable geo-energy interests in Armenia's current and future participation in gas transportation projects and infrastructure, electricity generation and the use of natural gas vehicles. The latter sector is well developed in Armenia. Additionally, Gazprom owns Armenia's gas transportation system. Finally, by maintaining the present conditions in the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia has managed to maintain an ally in the South Caucasus. Although Russia has not recognised Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent state or expressly supported its annexation by Armenia, Russia tolerates its current de facto independence. At the same time, Russia has also conveyed to authorities of Nagorno-Karabakh that a resolution of the conflict that is favourable to the region's interests will only be possible if they do not infringe upon Russian geo-energy interests. Conclusions The present article illustrates the direct and clear connection between Russia's intervention in the three conflicts and the defence of Russian geo-energy interests in the post-Soviet era, especially since Putin's rise to power. Interventions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, especially those following the 2008 war, have allowed Russia to consolidate and intensify its presence in Georgia, which is positioned as a strategic energy corridor from the South Caucasus and which presents the only alternative to the Russian pipeline system for oil transport from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. After the war, Russia acquired complete control over the Abkhaz coast to strengthen its already massive presence in the Black Sea, to control hydrocarbon transport and the Abkhaz continental shelf and gas fields, and to obtain considerable income by signing energy contracts. Russia has strengthened the Black Sea region in order to control strategic regional pipelines to the detriment of the Caspian Sea area and to block access to the Black Sea. Russia closely monitors pipelines connecting Azerbaijan with the rest of the South Caucasus and with Russia itself, and has prevented the development of new pipelines that would cross the South Caucasus while avoiding Russian territory as well as the planning of new pipelines avoiding Russian territory that would connect Central Asia with the South Caucasus, and the South Caucasus with Europe. Equally to the detriment of the Caspian Sea region, Russia has also increased the significance of the Black Sea as energy corridor while enhancing the South Stream project. Thus, Russia prevails as the main transit route for current and future pipelines, contradicting Western desires for importation routes avoiding Russian to reduce dependency. In addition, Russia has limited relations between the South Caucasus and NATO, and Georgia could only join NATO if it renounced sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia and accepted defeat. Additionally, with the 2008 war, Russia warned states with territorial tensions in its sphere of influence that approaching the EU or NATO could harm Russian geo-energy interests. Additionally, by recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign states, Russia warned Armenia and Azerbaijan that the NagornoKarabakh conflict will follow the Russian road map. In particular, Russia warned Azerbaijan that Russia could recognise the sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh. The current conditions of the conflict significantly favour Russia, and Russian intervention has always sought to maintain this arrangement. Although it is unlikely that the parties will reach an agreement, Russia insists on resolving conflicts through dialogue and reserves the right to intervene militarily. With respect to Azerbaijan, the current scenario allows Russia to refrain from antagonising a highly strategic state with respect to energy policy by maintaining for Azerbaijan the option of regaining Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven districts. However, Russia has simultaneously informed Azerbaijan that a conflict resolution favourable to Azerbaijan's interests will only be possible if Azerbaijan does not harm Russian geoenergy interests. While Azerbaijan's support for the building of the WREP and BTC oil pipelines caused Russia to reject Azerbaijan as a partner, Russian pressure largely explained why Azerbaijan and the consortium that operates the Shah Deniz field chose the TAP for gas transport to Europe in 2013. In the current context of developing Russian-Azerbaijani energy relations, SOCAR and Russia's Rosneft signed a joint venture in 2013, and SOCAR announced plans to transport Russian oil through the BTC oil pipeline in the near future and to reverse the flow of the Baku-Novorossiysk oil pipeline to send Russian oil to Azerbaijan. This could imply a major shift in the geo-energy outlook of the South Caucasus. In addition, in keeping the Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia conflicts frozen, Russia has managed to sow doubts ovedrthe future of TAP and other existing or proposed pipelines that intend to cross the South Caucasus while avoiding Russian territory, which may represent military targets. No pipeline currently crosses Armenia due to strained Armenian-Azerbaijani relations, and this benefits Russian geoenergy interests. With respect to Armenia, by maintaining the present conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia has retained a historical ally while limiting the region's relations with the EU. Although Russia does not explicitly support the formal independence of Nagorno-Karabakh or its annexation by Armenia, it tolerates the territory's de facto independence and Armenian control overthe seven Azerbaijani districts. However, Russia has not positioned itself against Azerbaijan, in which Russia holds a strategic interest in geo-energy terms. In addition, as it did with Azerbaijan, Russia informed Armenia that a conflict resolution agreement favourable to Armenian interests will only be possible if Armenia does not harm Russian geo-energy interests. Thus, Russian pressure has prevented Iranian-Armenian negotiations on hydrocarbons from progressing. Russia has also ensured that Armenia will continue to buy virtually all of its gas and oil supplies from Russia, generating significant revenue. In 2006, Gazprom acquired 80 percent of the shares of its Armenian equivalent, ArmRosgazprom, and in 2014 purchased the remaining 20 percent. Russia holds significant geo-energy interests in Armenia's current and future participation in gas transportation projects and transport, electricity generation and the use of NGVs. Gazprom owns the Armenian gas transportation system, and Russia has even managed to involve Armenia in some way in the RussianGeorgian conflict, enhancing the Gyumri military base. Finally, concerning the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, by maintaining the present scenario, Russia has managed to acquire another ally within the South Caucasus. Although Russia has not recognised the territory as an independentstate or expressly supported its annexation by Armenia, Russia tolerates its current de facto independence. At the same time, Russia has also conveyed to the authorities of NagornoKarabakh that a conflict resolution agreement favourable to the territory's interests {becoming a sovereign state or incorporation into Armenia) will only be possible if it does not harm Russian geo-energy interests. Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are aware that the evolution of these conditions will primarily be determined by Russia. All three are forced to adhere to Russia's interests if they wish for Russia to attend to their conflicting interests. We therefore conclude that Russia's interventions in the three post-Soviet secessionist conflicts in the South Caucasus have greatly benefited Russian geo-energy interests. 11#03/2011 The UCV provides a forum før scientific exchange and public dissemination of up-to-date scientific knowledge on conflict and violence.

The G-7 ministers backed last week's U.S. missile attack in Syria, which followed the suspected use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. ""We are shocked and horrified"" by the reported chemical attack, the G-7 foreign chiefs said in a joint statement issued after a two-day meeting in the central Italian city of Lucca. They described the subsequent U.S. strike as a ""carefully calibrated, limited in scope response to this war crime."" The G-7 ministers condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. ""North Korea's repeated breaches of international law pose new levels of challenges,"" they said, urging Pyongyang to refrain from any further nuclear tests or missile launches. The ministers confirmed that the G-7 countries including Japan will urge Russia to play a constructive role in Syria, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters after the meeting. On North Korea, the ministers agreed to call on China to play a greater role, Kishida said. During a special session on Syria on Tuesday, Kishida said his country will provide as much humanitarian assistance as possible to all Syrian people facing hard times. Kishida said that, for promoting a political settlement in Syria, it is crucial to realize a nationwide ceasefire and improve the country's humanitarian situation. Other participants expressed support for this view. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Lucca meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed hope that Assad ""will not be a part"" of Syria's future determined by its people. However, Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said the G-7 ministers failed to reach an accord on additional sanctions against the Syrian regime. The G-7 ministers expressed concern about the situation in the East China Sea and South China Sea, apparently referring to China's maritime assertiveness. The statement reiterated the G-7 countries' strong opposition to any unilateral actions that increase regional tensions and urged all parties to comply with their obligations under international law.END"

f644c8c1-47ba-40ee-85bf-47d60a6cae15,"March 18, 2014, was a day of triumph for President Vladimir Putin, who was then serving his third term in that office. In the speech he delivered that day in the tsarist-era St. George's Hall of the Kremlin, a venue for meeting foreign delegations and holding the most solemn ceremonies of state, the Russian president asked the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, whose members were gathered in the hall, to pass a law annexing the Crimea. The reaction of the audience, which greeted the speech more than once with explosive applause, left no doubt that the law would be passed without delay. Only three days later, the Federal Assembly declared the Crimea to be part of Russia. In his speech, Vladimir Putin hailed the annexation of the Crimea—an act undertaken in violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine, which had been guaranteed by Russo-Ukrainian treaties and ensured by the Budapest Memorandum of 1994—as a triumph of historical justice. Much of Putin's argument was historical and cultural in nature. Putin, who has never concealed his regret and even bitterness about the fall of the Soviet Union, referred specifically to the Soviet collapse in a speech delivered on the occasion of the Russian annexation of the Crimea in March 2014. ""The Soviet Union fell apart. Things developed so swiftly that few people realized how truly dramatic those events and their consequences would be,"" said Putin, recalling the events of 1991. ""It was only when the Crimea ended up as part of a different country that Russia realized that it had not only been robbed but plundered."" He continued: ""And what about the Russian state? It humbly accepted the situation. This country was going through such hard times then that, realistically, it was incapable of defending its interests."" Putin's speech was meant to remove all doubt that the ""hard times"" were over and that Russia was back, prepared to undo the ""injustice"" inflicted on it by the disintegration of the USSR. 1 What exactly that would mean, and how far Russia was prepared to go in order to undo perceived injustice, were the questions on the minds of many world leaders. After a telephone conversation with Putin, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said in apparent disbelief that he was living ""in another world."" The former American president, Bill Clinton, provided clarification of what world that was, suggesting that Putin wanted to re-establish Russian greatness in nineteenth-century terms. Prime Minister Arsenii Yatseniuk of Ukraine repeatedly accused Putin of wanting to restore the Soviet Union. The Russian president denied the charges, stating that he was not trying to bring back either the empire or the USSR. During the past decade, Russia has been waging open and hybrid wars, annexing territories, and using its virtual monopoly on energy supplies to the countries of Eastern Europe as a weapon, the object being to establish a much less costly and more flexible system of political control over post-Soviet space than was available either to the Russian Empire or to the Soviet Union. Yet many policies of the present-day Russian leadership have their origins in the last years and months of the existence of the USSR. 2 By far the most important of those policies has been the Russian leadership's early decision to maintain Moscow's political, economic, and military control over the ""near abroad,"" as the Russian political elite and media dubbed the former Soviet republics. As early as the fall of 1991, advisers to Boris Yeltsin envisioned Russia gathering in the republics on its borders within the subsequent twenty years. Like many other former imperial powers, Russia opted out of the empire because it lacked the resources to keep the costly imperial project going. Unlike most of its counterparts, however, it took along the rich oil and gas resources of the empire—most of the Soviet oil and gas reserves were located in Russian Siberia. Thus Russia had more to gain economically than to lose from the collapse of the USSR. Russian control over oil and gas resources made the divorce with the empire in 1991 easier in economic terms and prevented armed conflict between Russia and the republics that declared independence. We now know that such conflict was not eliminated but merely postponed. Over the last decade, rising oil and gas prices have made it possible for Russia to rebuild its economic potential and military might, allowing it to reopen the question of disputed borders and territories, and step up its efforts to gather back the Soviet republics more than twenty years after the Soviet collapse. Ukraine, the second-largest post-Soviet republic, has played a crucial role in preventing successive Russian attempts to reintegrate the ""near abroad"" in economic, military, and political terms. Back in 1991, Russo-Ukrainian relations were the key factor in deciding the future of the Soviet Union. In August 1991, once the Ukrainian parliament declared the republic's independence, the Russian government of Boris Yeltsin threatened Kyiv with partitioning of its territory. Fingers were pointed specifically at the Crimea and the Donbas, which became a battleground twenty-three years later. Despite threats from Moscow, Ukraine pushed forward with its quest for independence, and in December 1991 the Soviet Union was replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was the result of a Russo-Ukrainian compromise. In his speech on the annexation of the Crimea, Putin claimed that many in Russia regarded the Commonwealth as a new form of statehood. But that was not the position of the Ukrainian leadership, which took its own independence and that of the other Soviet republics with the utmost seriousness. 3 In the 1990s, Ukraine turned the Commonwealth into an instrument for a ""civilized divorce""—a term coined in Kyiv—as opposed to one for Russian control over the ""near abroad."" Ukraine worked hard to ensure recognition of its borders by Russia. In 1994, Kyiv gave up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for a guarantee of territorial integrity and independence given by Russia, the United States, and Great Britain. In 1997, the Ukrainian government agreed to lease the naval base in Sevastopol to the Russian fleet in exchange for a treaty that recognized the inviolability of Ukrainian borders. It took the Russian parliament two years to ratify the treaty that formally recognized the Crimea and Sevastopol as integral parts of Ukrainian territory. It seemed that the two countries had finally resolved all outstanding issues in their relations resulting from the Soviet collapse. 4 The next decade demonstrated the limits of the Russo-Ukrainian understanding and the degree to which Russia was prepared to recognize Ukraine as an independent state. In the late 1990s, Ukraine began its drift toward the West, declaring integration into the European Union as the goal of its foreign policy and refusing to join Russia-led economic, military, and political institutions. Domestically, Ukraine managed to remain a much more pluralistic society than Russia, with a strong parliament, competitive politics, and an influential opposition. In 2004, Ukrainian civil society refused to accept the results of a rigged election and endorse the Russian-backed candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, as the country's new president. After a long and peaceful protest that became known as the Orange Revolution, the outgoing president of Ukraine agreed to a new round of elections that brought to power a pro-Western candidate, Viktor Yushchenko. From that time on, Moscow treated Kyiv's orientation on the West not only as a growing external danger but also as a threat to its own increasingly authoritarian regime. As far as the Kremlin was concerned, Ukraine's rejection of rigged elections and resistance to a corrupt regime was setting an example to Russia's own struggling civil society and had to be stopped at all costs. 5 The current crisis in Russo-Ukrainian relations began on the night of November 21, 2013, with a Facebook post by a Ukrainian journalist of Afghan descent, Mustafa Nayem. He was disturbed by news that the government of Viktor Yanukovych, who had come to power in 2010, had refused to sign a long-awaited association agreement with the European Union, which envisioned the creation of a free economic zone including Ukraine and EU, and stipulated bringing the Ukrainian legislation, democratic procedures and business practices in line with those of the European Union. ""Fine,"" wrote Nayem in his Facebook account, ""Let's be serious. Who is ready to show up on the Maidan by midnight tonight? Only comments on this post with the words 'I'm ready.'"" There were six hundred ""I'm ready"" responses. At 9:30 p.m., Nayem typed another post: ""Dress warmly, bring umbrellas, tea, coffee, a good mood, and friends."" Shortly after 10:00 p.m., he was on Kyiv's central square, known in Ukrainian as the Maidan, where the Orange Revolution had begun ten years earlier. About thirty people had gathered by the time he arrived. By midnight, there were more than a thousand young, educated urbanites. For them, the expected association agreement with the EU was the last hope that Ukraine might finally embark on a European course of development, overcome corruption, modernize its economy, and provide a decent standard of living for its people. Now, those hopes were being crushed. Nayem and his friends could not remain silent. 6 The protest began like a festival, with singing and dancing to brave the cold weather of late November. It soon became known as the Euromaidan—the largest pro-European rally in history. President Yanukovych, for his part, had learned from the Orange Revolution of 2004 that the sooner one got rid of protesters, the better. Thus, in the early hours of November 30, riot police were ordered to attack the students camping on the Maidan. They did so with the utmost brutality under the pretext of clearing the square to allow the construction of a huge Christmas tree in preparation for New Year celebrations that were still one month away. Once images of police beating unarmed students were posted on the Internet, dormant Ukrainian civil society reacted sharply. The next day was Sunday, and more than half a million people showed up in downtown Kyiv to protest police brutality. The Euromaidan, which had begun with protests against the postponement of the signing of the EU association agreement, turned into what became known as the Revolution of Dignity. Hundreds of thousands of people would join the protests that continued through December 2013 into January and February 2014. With the United States and EU countries applying pressure on President Yanukovych for a peaceful resolution of the crisis, Yanukovych turned to Russia. Ever since his election in 2010, the Kremlin had wanted him to stop Ukraine's drift toward the West, refuse to sign the association agreement with the EU, and join the Russia-led customs union whose members included Belarus and Kazakhstan. Yanukovych was at first reluctant to do so, but the Kremlin raised the stakes by starting a trade war with Ukraine in the summer of 2013. In November, Yanukovych gave up. He refused to sign the agreement with the EU and went to Russia instead to negotiate a U.S. $15 billion loan needed to keep his kleptocratic government afloat until the next presidential elections, which were scheduled for 2015. The Russian government granted the loan and delivered the first instalment. The task now was to keep Yanukovych in power, and the Kremlin thought it could best be done by suppressing the Maidan protests—an option advocated publicly by Putin's adviser Sergei Glazev. In January 2014, as protests continued, Yanukovych forced laws through parliament allowing him to do just that. But the new laws, condemned by the opposition as draconian, only brought more people onto the streets. Clashes between protesters and police began in late January, reaching their peak on February 18, 2014, when dozens of protesters and policemen were killed by gunfire. That day the government ordered snipers to shoot at the protesters, and fatalities among them soon exceeded one hundred. Those killed by the police and hired thugs became known as the ""heavenly hundred."" The European Union imposed sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, on members of the Ukrainian government responsible for the use of force against the protesters. The Ukrainian parliament, dominated by big-business oligarchs who did not want to lose access to money stashed in Western banks, passed a resolution prohibiting the government from using force against citizens. That was the end of the Yanukovych regime, which could not survive without reliance on brute force. On February 21, 2014, EU delegates led by the Polish minister of foreign affairs, Radosław Sikorski, negotiated a deal between Yanukovych and the leaders of the opposition. One of its conditions was a new presidential election before the end of the year. But Yanukovych, who had no illusions about its outcome, fled his mansion near Kyiv the same night, taking reportedly hundreds of millions of dollars and leaving behind a private zoo and a fleet of vintage cars. The next day parliament voted to remove him from office. He drove with his bodyguards to the Crimea, and then, by some accounts, boarded a Russian ship to make his way to the Russian Federation, where he was granted citizenship. 7 The Russian government was extremely displeased with the turn of events in Kyiv. On February 21, 2014, the Russian representative at the negotiations conducted by Sikorski refused to sign the agreement on behalf of his state, but after Yanukovych fled Kyiv, Moscow accused the West and the Ukrainian opposition of not honoring the agreement. It declared the Kyiv events a coup and branded the new Ukrainian government unconstitutional. As the world watched the closing ceremonies of the Sochi winter Olympic Games on February 23, 2014, the corridors of European foreign ministries were rife with speculation about what Russia might do once the games were over. Vladimir Putin later admitted that on that day he gave his subordinates an order to begin the takeover of the Crimea. On February 27, four days after the end of the Olympics, Viktor Yanukovych, now safe on Russian territory, issued a statement claiming to be the legitimate president of Ukraine, and a detachment of heavily armed men in unmarked uniforms—seized the buildings of the Supreme Council and government of the Crimea and flew Russian flags atop both centers of power. On the same day, with the ""green men"" firmly in control, the Crimean parliament held a closed session that lacked a quorum, according to numerous reports, and dissolved the Crimean government. As the new prime minister, it appointed Sergei Aksenov, the leader of the Russian Unity Party, which had obtained only 4% of the vote in the Crimean parliamentary elections. On March 1, Aksenov appealed to Vladimir Putin to help ensure ""peace and order"" on the peninsula. The next day, Russian military units moved out of their barracks in Sevastopol and, with the support of troops brought from Russia, seized control of the Crimea. They were assisted by specially trained groups of Russian Cossacks and mercenaries from Russia, as well as local militias. Vladimir Putin and the members of his government, who had originally denied allegations of Russian military intervention in the Crimea, eventually admitted the participation of the Russian military in its takeover. The Russian annexation of the Crimea was given a veneer of legitimacy by a referendum hastily organized on March 16, 2014. Officials declared that more than 83% of eligible voters had taken part in the referendum, with close to 97% voting in favor of joining Russia. Unofficial reports, including those from the Human Rights Council subordinate to the Russian president, cut both numbers almost in half, estimating the turnout at under 40% and the vote for joining Russia at under 60%. Those figures find support in a poll conducted in the Crimea in February 2014, when not many more than 40% of those polled were in favor of joining Russia. But the new authorities clearly did not want to take any risks and went for outright falsification. In the city of Sevastopol, they reported a turnout that amounted to 123% of registered voters. The referendum was boycotted by the 250,000-strong Crimean Tatar community and declared illegal by the government of Ukraine. Its results were not recognized by the international community. But on March 18, 2014, Russia officially annexed the peninsula. In his speech on the occasion, Vladimir Putin claimed that the Crimean referendum had been held ""in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms."" 8 It turned out that the annexation of the Crimea was just the beginning of Russian aggression against Ukraine. In April, veterans of the Crimean campaign from the ranks of the Russian Cossacks, nationalist activists, and undercover intelligence officers moved from the Crimea to the cities and towns of southern and eastern Ukraine. Their targets were government administration buildings, as well as headquarters of police and security services in the cities of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, and Odesa, as well as in the smaller towns of southeastern Ukraine. The goal, many believe, was to proclaim a number of separatist republics that would then unite as one Russia-backed state of Novorossiia, or New Russia—the name originally used for one of the imperial provinces in southern Ukraine after the Russian annexation of the Crimea in the late eighteenth century. Participants in anti-government rallies were often bussed across the border from Russia and the Russian-controlled Transnistria region of Moldova. The new revolutionary government in Kyiv was completely unprepared to deal with the Russian annexation of the Crimea and the hybrid war that the Kremlin had begun in the eastern Ukrainian Donbas . For months, the leaders of the new government had led the opposition in its street war against the police and now could not rely on its support in dealing with the foreign-inspired insurgency. In fact, many policemen joined the Russian mercenaries and the local rebels. The Ukrainian army was virtually non-existent. It was in transition from a conscript army to a professional one, severely underfunded, with no combat experience. The Russians had been fighting their war in Chechnya since 1991, and the Ukrainians were no match for the well-trained Russian regular troops and Special Forces. It soon turned out they had major problems in dealing even with Russian-trained local militias. The troops originally could not bring themselves to shoot at paramilitaries who were firing on them and taking over their barracks and equipment. Kyiv began to put its act together only in mid-April. It was then that one of the leaders of the Maidan protests and the new minister of the interior, Arsen Avakov, managed to reclaim the regional administration building in his native Kharkiv, and Igor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian oligarch, returned from de facto exile in Switzerland to lead the government of his native Dnipropetrovsk region. Avakov, an ethnic Armenian, and Kolomoisky, an ethnic Jew, emerged as the ""saviors"" of Ukraine from the Russian hybrid-war offensive, dispelling the myth of the nationalist or even fascist leanings of the new government in Kyiv and its supporters disseminated by Russian propaganda. By mid-May, it was clear that the Russian attempt to raise a revolt throughout southeastern Ukraine and create Novorossiia, a state that would divide Ukraine in half and provide the Russian government with land access to the Crimea and Transnistria, had failed. The Russian strategists of the hybrid war were much more successful in the Donbas industrial region on Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, where Russian-backed separatists declared the formation of the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics. On April 12, armed men led by Igor Girkin , a former colonel in Russian military intelligence and a veteran of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, seized the government and police headquarters in the city of Sloviansk in the northeastern Donbas. By the end of the month, militias led by the former Russian intelligence officers and reinforced by Cossacks, volunteers, and Chechen fighters brought in from Russia and funded with Russian money had seized administrative buildings in most cities and towns of the region, including its two major centers, the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. They also seized radio and television stations, cutting off Ukrainian channels and bombarding listeners and viewers with misinformation about the new Kyiv government, which was called a ""fascist junta,"" and its plans, which allegedly included the desire to ban the Russian language in the region. Viewers and listeners were promised Russian salaries and pensions, which were significantly higher than those in Ukraine, and citizenship either in Russia or in the new state of Novorossiia, which would include a good half of Ukraine. The propaganda was effective: significant numbers of unemployed and semi- employed youth joined the rebel militias, where they were paid for their services. The resistance of the pro-Kyiv activists was crushed, and some of them were kidnapped and killed, while help from Kyiv failed to arrive. There were several reasons why the covert Russian invasion met little resistance in the Donbas. A major industrial powerhouse in Soviet times, it had become an economically depressed area with the switch from a command economy to the market after 1991. Like cities in rust belts throughout the world, Donetsk became a criminal capital. Many of its new elites had criminal backgrounds or connections, with the region's best-known politician, Viktor Yanukovych, having served two prison sentences in his youth. While dependent on subsidies from Kyiv, the region had a strong sense of local pride and identity. Its ethnic composition differed from that of neighboring regions of Ukraine, as ethnic Russians constituted majorities in Donetsk and some other towns of the area. In 2001, only 24% of the inhabitants of Donetsk oblast and 30% of those in Luhansk oblast identified Ukrainian as their native language, as compared with 67% in neighboring Dnipropetrovsk oblast. Although ethnic Ukrainians made up 47% of the population of Donetsk, only 27% of the city's children received their education in Ukrainian. Russian was the dominant language on the streets of the Donbas, and the local elites exploited that fact to mobilize their electorate, claiming that the new Kyiv government was a threat to the Russian language. Despite their strong sense of local identity, in early April 2014, 85% of Donetsk residents were opposed to the seizure of government buildings and installations by militias, and more than 60% favored the arrest of separatist activists. But the local political and business elites refused to act against the Russia-led insurgents. They either remained neutral or even tacitly supported the protests in the hope that the new government in Kyiv would be more willing to make a deal with them if the region was in turmoil. It was a short-sighted tactic. They would soon lose control over the rapidly developing crisis. As the leaders of the Russian-inspired and funded insurgency took a page from the local elite's playbook and used the theme of protecting the allegedly threatened Russian language and culture, the region's political and business elites decided to go with the flow. In the local referendum that took place on May 11, 2014, and was not recognized by Kyiv, voters were asked whether they supported the samostoiatel'nost' of the republic—a term that could mean either autonomy or independence. The leaders of the Donetsk republic declared that 89% of voters favored independence, and the corresponding figure in Luhansk was 96%, but these figures were as fraudulent as the ones released in the Crimean referendum, and many of those who voted later claimed that they wanted broad autonomy, not independence. The referendum took place without the presence of international observers and was not recognized by the international community. The Ukrainian government launched a counteroffensive against the separatist takeover of the Donbas in mid-April, without apparent success until after the presidential election of May 25, 2014. It brought to power one of the leaders of the Euromaidan protests, Ukrainian business tycoon Petro Poroshenko, who won more than half the vote in the first round. On May 26, the Ukrainian army recaptured the Donetsk international airport; on June 13, it took control of the port city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea; and on July 5, it took the city of Sloviansk, forcing the units of Colonel Igor Girkin, who by then had declared himself defence minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, to retreat to Donetsk. With the Ukrainian forces on the offensive, Russia increased its support for the separatist insurgents, now led by two Russian citizens with close links to the Russian government and security services—Colonel Girkin and the self-proclaimed prime minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Borodai. In the second half of June, the Ukrainian government claimed and NATO intelligence confirmed the continuing influx from Russia to Ukraine, not only of trained militants but also of heavy military equipment, including tanks and multiple rocket launchers. On July 17, 2014, the war in eastern Ukraine became truly international as Russia-backed separatists shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH 17, killing all 298 people on board. The destruction of a civilian airliner produced a flood of protests throughout the world, forcing U.S. and EU leaders to step up sanctions against Russian political and business elites associated with the undeclared war against Ukraine. But sanctions, which have an impact over time, had no immediate effect on Russian behaviour. If anything, Russia increased its involvement in Ukraine. In July, Russian artillery and missiles began bombarding Ukrainian territory from the Russian side of the border, and in August regular units of the Russian army crossed the border not just to reinforce Russian mercenaries and local militias but also to take the lead in fighting the Ukrainian armed forces and volunteer battalions. Thousands of Russian regular troops took part in the offensive launched by the separatists during the last week of August 2014. Some of them were captured by the Ukrainian military and paraded before television cameras as proof of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By sending regular troops into a battle previously fought under the command of Russian military officers and with Russian equipment, Moscow stopped the Ukrainian advance and saved the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk republics from imminent defeat. In early September 2014, with the participation of Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , the two sides signed an agreement that resulted in a shaky ceasefire. In February 2015, a new ceasefire was negotiated in Minsk by the leaders of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine, only to be violated in the next few weeks by the takeover by the Russia-backed militants of a strategic railway centre in Debaltseve, previously held by the Ukrainian side. In 2015, despite the Minsk II agreement, Russia continued to provide military support for its puppet regimes in Donbas, sending not only supplies and weapons, but also its military personnel, and causing the continuation of the sanctions introduced by the West to discourage Russia from the escalation of the conflict. 9 The Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then post-Soviet Russia all associated international power and security with control over territories along their borders. If they could not control such territories completely, they would partition them and control what they could. This was the rationale behind the partitions of Poland in the second half of the eighteenth century and the division of Germany after World War II. The ""New Russia"" project, launched by the Russian government in 2014, had as its primary goal the partitioning of Ukraine and the creation of a Russian-controlled state in the southern and eastern parts of the country. That project failed, as Russia managed to destabilize and control only a small part of the projected state of New Russia. While the Crimea was annexed right away, the Russian covert war in the Donbas created conditions for the establishment of another enclave of ""frozen conflict"" unrecognized by the rest of the world, not unlike Transnistria on the territory of Moldova and Southern Ossetia and Abkhazia on the territory of Georgia. These enclaves are used to apply pressure to Western-leaning republics. Chances are that this will be the primary function of the new frozen-conflict area in eastern Ukraine. Many in Russia and around the world believe that the crisis is far from over, mainly because Vladimir Putin did not achieve most of what he wanted when he began his aggression against Ukraine. ""Putin wanted to tie Ukraine to Russia, to encourage its entry into the Customs Union. He got the exact opposite,"" wrote the Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in October 2014. ""He wanted Ukraine to maintain a neutral status. He failed miserably … He wanted to win the respect of the Ukrainian people. He created a long-term enemy … Putin wanted a 'Novorossiia' stretching from Donetsk to Odesa. He got a small section of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts … e wanted a corridor to the Crimea via Mariupol. He raised awareness and resistance among the locals and spurred Russians residents in Mariupol to dig trenches around the city … He wanted to seize land without firing a single shot, as in the Crimea. He got 4,000 people killed on both sides … Putin wanted to be recognized as a strong leader in world politics. He became an outcast."" Indeed, short of the annexation of the Crimea, few of the original goals set by the Russian leadership in the winter and spring of 2014 were achieved by the end of that year. And even that came with the huge cost to the Russian economy and international prestige. 10 In the wake of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, Vladimir Putin's stock in the West fell to an unprecedented low. Relatives of those who perished in the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH 17 held him responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. But the damage goes far beyond the loss of prestige. According to the leaked Russian documents, Russia funds and runs in military, administrative and economic terms, the self-declared republics in the eastern part of Ukraine—an additional burden on the struggling Russian economy. In Ukraine, the cost is calculated not only in money and resources, but also in human lives. The war has claimed more than 9,000 dead and at least twice as many wounded. Millions left the conflict zone, creating a refugee crisis in Ukraine that dwarfs the current refugee problem of the European Union. 11 The hopes that the conflict can be resolved soon fade with every day of its continuation. The Minsk Agreements reached between Russia, Ukraine and the representatives of the pro-Russian separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine in September 2014, and amended with the help of Germany and France in February 2015 show little signs of life. The political solution as agreed in February 2015 includes an end to hostilities; the withdrawal of all foreign military formations, including mercenaries, from the separatist republics; and the organization of local elections, which in turn should lead to the reestablishment of Ukraine's control over its borders with the Russian Federation. But the agreements fail to specify what comes first: the withdrawal of foreign military formations, which everyone understands are Russian, or the elections. 12 The realization of the ""elections first"" scenario would ensure continuing Russian control over the region once it formally reenters Ukraine. A Russian-controlled Donbas, which the war has turned into a humanitarian disaster zone, would thus become a ball chained to Ukraine's leg, making economic and political reforms currently under way in that country all but impossible. The key precondition for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements—the end to the military hostilities—remains to be an elusive target. August 2016 saw a significant increase of the Russian troops on the borders with Ukraine and the Ukrainian president Petr Poroshenko warned the world about Russia preparing a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In October 2016, the leaders of the four countries that participated in the Minsk negotiations in February 2015 agreed on the creation of a road map for the implementation of the Minsk agreements, but privately few European officials expect the agreements to be implemented anytime soon. 13 What is at stake in the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict is much more than the future of the Donbas. Even after the loss of the Crimea and the de facto loss of much of the Donbas, Ukraine is still the second-largest post-Soviet state in territory, population and economic potential. Russia's current involvement in the Middle East notwithstanding, Moscow's geopolitical priority today and in the foreseeable future will remain the post-Soviet space. Without establishing firm control over that area, Russia will not be able to become a truly powerful player on the world stage. As in the past, the success of the latest integrationist project in Eurasia depends on the second-largest post-Soviet republic. What happens in Ukraine in the next few years will have a major influence on Russian behavior in the region and throughout the world. If Moscow loses Ukraine, its grip on the rest of the post-Soviet space will weaken, as will its ability to engage in foreign adventures elsewhere. History, recent and more distant, provides a useful lens that helps to assess the importance of the Ukraine Crisis. Many speak today of a return of cold-war relations between Russia and the West. Some American politicians, including Hillary Clinton, compared Russia's readiness to use the rhetoric of protecting Russian-speakers abroad as a pretext for the invasion and annexation of foreign territories with the policies of Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and annexation of the Crimea was indeed the first case of forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the end of World War II. Parallels were also drawn between the actions of Slobodan Milošević in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and Vladimir Putin in 2014—both had used the national minority's card as a pretext for war. 14 Ukraine's movement away from its former imperial master toward an international center of gravity finds numerous parallels in the history of the disintegration of empires and the emergence of national states. The French helped the British colonies of North America free themselves from London; the British, Russians, and French helped the Greeks free themselves from Istanbul; and in 1918, the Germans backed the Ukrainian nation-building project against Bolshevik Moscow. What makes the Ukrainian situation different is that the European Union, the pole that attracts Ukraine most, is not a united polity or a state at all. The strength and attractiveness of the EU lie in its values and in the models of political, economic, and social organization of its member states. Its weaknesses are its cumbersome structure and difficulty in formulating a coherent foreign policy. Nor is the EU equipped to deal with military threats and war situations like the one in Ukraine. The EU has the ability to attract, but currently no political will to accept new members and no military muscle to defend those aspiring to join it. The Ukrainian crisis reminded the world once again of the importance of the United States as a major stakeholder in European security and prosperity—the role it played for most of the twentieth century. The U.S., whose involvement in East European affairs diminished significantly in the wake of Second Gulf War, began its return to the region's political scene with the start of the Euro-Revolution in Ukraine. Washington, whose relations with Moscow have been tarnished by tensions in the Middle East in the wake of the Arab Spring of 2010, and suffered a further setback with Putin's return to the office of Russian president in the spring of 2012, has provided leadership in formulating a joint Western response to the crisis. That response, which included diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions against Russia, as well as financial and limited military assistance to Ukraine, helped stop Russian aggression in the fall of 2014. With the United States and the European Union experiencing difficulties in agreeing on a common foreign policy objectives, what we see today is not a reenactment of the Cold War or a new version of the Great Game, a superpower rivalry that played itself out in Central Asia in the nineteenth century and in East Central Europe through most of the twentieth century. Both the United States and the European Union are at best reluctant participants in the current crisis. The Cold War years of trying to haul any Western-leaning country out of Moscow's net are long gone. Neither the United States nor the EU is trying to gain control of Ukraine or keep the country in its sphere of influence. The need to respond to Russian aggression comes from the simple fact that such blatant violation of bilateral and multilateral agreements signed by that country has shaken and continues to threaten the foundations of the post-World War II and post-Cold War political order, raising the specter of arbitrary border revisions, regional conflicts, and global instability. The origins of the crisis that caught both Washington and Brussels by surprise lie in Ukraine's desire to transform itself by choosing a Western model of development and Russia's determination to stop that from happening and keep the former province in its embrace. To be sure, what happens in Ukraine depends mainly on the actions of the Ukrainians themselves. But historical contextualization of the current crisis suggests that Ukraine's desperate attempts to free itself from the suffocating embrace of its former master have a much greater chance of success with strong international support. The goal should not be to move Ukraine from one sphere of influence to another but to reject imperial and post-imperial forms of domination, which should be relegated completely to the past, where they belong.

ceea06fa-612e-464a-8840-6738ebafa418,"March 20 - Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on Russia to grant access to the Ukrainian consul to Ukrainian film director Oleh Sentsov, illegally imprisoned in the prison colony of the city of Labytnangi, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in Russia's Tyumen Oblast, MFA spokeswoman Mariana Betsa has said. ""In connection with the information about the deterioration of Sentsov's health, we demand that the Russian Federation immediately grant the consul access to Oleh #FreeSentsov,"" she wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. Earlier, Sentsov's sister, Natalia Kaplan, reported she had received a letter from the brother who writes about the deterioration of his health. ""A letter from Oleh has arrived. He sends greetings to everyone and says that everything is fine with him, although he writes that his teeth are crumbling and his hair is falling out. He notes he is losing health slowly, but irretrievably,"" Kaplan wrote on Facebook. As reported, the North Caucasus District Military Court in Russia's Rostov-on-Don in August 2015 sentenced Sentsov to 20-year imprisonment in a high-security penal colony. He was found guilty of creating a so-called terrorist organization in Russian-annexed Crimea.

9ef0c8a3-a4e6-4f09-9eef-96d728de5f46,"MOSCOW--Russia is tearing up its contracts to supply Ukraine with natural gas, sparking another stand-off between Moscow and Kiev and raising fears of new gas supply shortages across Europe during the winter. Ukraine on Saturday accused Russia of undermining its role as a gas supplier and warned that Moscow could use the massive amounts of gas it pipes through Ukraine to Europe as a political weapon. Tensions are high amid a conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists that Kiev and the West says are controlled by Russia and include Russian army forces. Russia says its regular forces aren't in eastern Ukraine. Russian energy officials said the dispute was commercial and reflected its disagreement with an arbitration decision that just went in Ukraine's favor. The situation kindled memories of previous Moscow-Kiev gas fights in 2006 and 2009, which left Europe with shortages. But this time could play out differently, as Moscow no longer holds the same stranglehold on European energy supplies as it once did. Ukraine hasn't received Russian gas for more than two years but was expecting the shipments to resume this month. When Gazprom announced it wouldn't honor its contracts, Ukraine was able to scramble up new contracts for gas supplies by Saturday morning from Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, reported Interfax, a Russian news service. Meanwhile, all Russian gas bound for Europe across Ukraine continued to flow uninterrupted. Gazprom, which is heavily reliant on exports to Europe and is trying to expand them, only cut off contracts with Ukraine. ""For Europe the risk is gone,"" said Andriy Kobolyev , the head of Ukraine's state gas company, Naftogaz, in an interview. ""We did everything possible to make sure that the artificial crisis Russia was trying to create would not happen."" Still, the actions undercut the image Russia has tried to cultivate as a reliable supplier and sparked fears of escalation across Europe in the midst of cold stretch. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic warned Friday that the situation raised ""concerns not only for the direct supply of natural gas to Ukraine but possibly also for the transit of gas to the EU."" He also said he would be in contact with Gazprom and Naftogaz to look for a negotiated settlement. Mr. Kobolyev said Russia cut pipeline pressure for transit supplies to Europe by as much as 20%. The lack of pressure forced Ukraine to spend more energy to keep the gas flowing to Europe since the pressure wasn't coming from the Russian side. ""The decision to fail on the supply contract wasn't made in Gazprom, I believe it was made in the Kremlin,"" Mr. Kobolyev said. The actions come on the heels of a Stockholm arbitration court decision earlier this week that forced Gazprom to pay $2billion to Naftogaz. The arbitration case had been initiated between the two companies in June 2014, at the height of the crisis between Moscow and Kiev. The decision paved the way for Ukraine to restart imports of Russian gas from March based on an existing contract. Gazprom, however, said the arbitration decision had been one sided and decided to terminate the contract. ""We are definitely against solving the problems of Ukrainian economy at our expense,"" said PAO Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller in a statement. ""Under such a situation, the continuation of contracts for Gazprom is economically inexpedient and unprofitable."" Credit: By Thomas Grove"
e757cff7-8adf-443a-aefe-7e4bdc403305,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Russia and Iran to rein in a Syrian government offensive against a rebel-held suburb of Damascus, calling the attacks a massacre. The comments on Thursday came hours before a possible vote by the United Nations Security Council on a resolution for a 30-day cease-fire in Syria to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, an end to sieges and attacks against civilians in Syria. According to the White Helmets, a civil-defense group operating in opposition-held areas, at least 250 people have been killed in recent days in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital that is home to about 400,000 people and has been under siege for five years. The forces of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian warplanes, are seeking to restore control of Syria after a seven-year war. ""The regime is not fighting against terrorists, but against its own people, killing children, destroying hospitals, and this is a massacre to be condemned,"" Ms. Merkel said in Germany's parliament. She said that Iran and Russia, the Assad regime's main backers, have a particular responsibility for the situation. Moscow and Damascus deny targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure and say they are focused only on rebels fighting the government. European Union leaders are expected to raise the issue on Friday when they meet in Brussels. The bloc's foreign ministers are set for a broader discussion on Syria on Monday. --- Raja Abdulrahim contributed to this article."
589f80ec-9d38-489a-b78e-dee84f25d3ec,"Russia has stepped up its overt public diplomacy— taking a page from President Donald Trump’s Twitter playbook, and also taking comfort or refuge from his repeated refrain, undercutting his own national security team, that the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt.” “Over the past nine months to a year, we’ve seen a much more aggressive overt messaging campaign from Russian outlets, from a lot of embassy accounts and the Foreign Ministry,” said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Alliance for Security Democracy, which tracks such interference. She attributed it to Russian President Vladimir Putin being emboldened by Trump’s dismissive attitude toward Russian interference.“If you look at polling in the United States, particularly among Republicans, President Trump has done a pretty effective job in shifting public opinion, and there is a sense that Putin’s not a bad guy and we should have a better relationship with Russia,” Rosenberger said. That’s lowered normal skepticism toward messages from Moscow, creating an opening for Putin. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has embraced the open verbal combat, with her office running a competition among Russian embassies for the snarkiest twitter ripostes to criticism of Russia. The sharp-tongued Washington, D.C.-based embassy won this year, but a Russia official said that was only because “London couldn’t win two years in a row.” A classic tweet from the Russian embassy in London includes a tableau of photos of Putin shaking hands with multiple world leaders, below a quote from Britain’s defense chief Gavin Williamson, “Russia is becoming a pariah nation.” “Russia is becoming a pariah nation” by pic.twitter.com/wahMGGmVBI — Russian Embassy, UK September 21, 2018 A recent tweet from the Washington-based embassy celebrated that the “35-day period of administrative segregation of Maria Butina, commonly applied to hardened criminals is over,” meaning she’d been transferred to minimum security while awaiting the outcome of charges of operating as an unregistered foreign agent of Russia with the hashtag #FreeMariaButina. U.S. officials have warned Russia is already trying to covertly influence U.S. midterms, without revealing how, but some watchers in this space say this isn’t 2016 redux. Instead, the open messaging has stepped up. “They are now overtly talking to and tagging from their social media accounts I saw pushing Syria-related content back in 2014,” said former FBI agent Clint Watts, author of How to Win an Election—Social Media Inception . “They also have responded to Trump tweets and sided with him in the open.” We agree https://t.co/7l087Qwmj3 — MFA Russia ???? July 16, 2018 “It fits their ground game approach, which is to be right out in the open about what they are doing, engaging congressmen etc.,” Watts said. Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov has held numerous cultural and film events at his embassy, drawing a fascinating mix of pro-Moscow diplomats, academics and members of the Russian community. Antonov held a small cocktail party at the embassy grounds to mark the 75th anniversary of the “Victory in the Battle of Kursk,” a turning point in the Russian battle over the Nazis in World War II. He reminded the crowd of the good that can come when Russia is part of the solution. Antonov meets with only a handful of U.S. politicians like Sen. Rand Paul , as few other lawmakers will see him, and he has complained to other diplomats that his reception in D.C. has been frosty. So far, he’s been fairly press shy, talking amiably to journalists who attend his functions but mostly declining to be quoted. He’s fighting uphill against the effects of Moscow’s messaging. British officials have griped over Moscow’s public diplomacy practice of offering multiple explanations through multiple outlets in response to accusations about the country’s actions. After Britain accused Moscow of attempted murder of Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Russian officials and social media outlets spread a plethora of “could have been” explanations, including claiming that the Skripals were poisoned by a nerve agent possessed only by Britain and the U.S. The multiple versions are meant to “muddy the waters,” a senior western official said. “None of this is new. We’ve seen it for months and years.” A congressional staffer who tangled with Moscow over the years says the Kremlin hasn’t necessarily stepped up messaging overall—it’s just gotten better and more sophisticated. “They’ve been really strong for a long time. They’ve come out swinging since Magnitsky,” referring to the punishing sanctions approved by Congress to punish Russian officials after the 2009 death of accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison. “But they weren’t good at it. Everything was in broken English. In 2015 and 2016, they stepped it up. When they cleared ISIS from Palmyra in 2016, they got it going. They perfected it over Syria.” The various officials spoke anonymously as they didn’t want to become targets in the messaging arena. The messaging campaign aims to confuse the U.S. public by blending elements of truth with multiple competing narratives, a technique used with great effect on the Russian people. One Western diplomat steeped in Russian matters said many of its people have given up figuring out the truth, resigned to never knowing which image in the Russian news hallway of mirrors is real. The bot-and-troll campaign during the U.S. presidential election helped sow division here and across the West, leaving a growing number of Americans similarly doubtful of their own media news sources and unsure what to believe—and a more receptive audience to Moscow, just like their president."

a01f6b8d-0751-45fa-8005-057d72ad7080,"The usage of information as a weapon in the foreign and domestic policies of Russia is not a new phenomenon. Still, the sophistication and intensity of it grow with each passing year. Recently the EU and USA have realized the powerful latent influence of Russian media and propaganda, including on electoral processes and the activities of State administration. They have realized that Russian disinformation poses a serious threat to the United States and its European allies, first and foremost with regard to Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine. Moreover, unlike Soviet propaganda, the modern methods of the Russian information war do not rudely promote the agenda of the Kremlin. Instead, they aim to confuse, daze and divert citizens from supporting the EU and Ukraine. Russia seeks to undermine the support for European values; producing disarray among European allies in order to increase its influence. Ethnic, linguistic, regional, social and historical contradictions and stereotypes are used for this purpose. As current experience shows, Russian advocacy efforts in Europe make up an important part of their hybrid approach to the projection of force. Despite the fact that the crisis in Ukraine for the first time drew the attention of the West to the importance and real meaning of the information campaign in Russia, the Kremlin's use of disinformation was launched long before the crisis. Russia carefully and purposefully prepared an information war against Ukraine. Keywords: cyberspace, cyber security, hacker attacks, information security. Introduction The hybrid war in the East of Ukraine and the information confrontation with the Russian State, a state that systematically uses the media space and the Internet to achieve its political goals, necessitates the study of the issue of protecting the cyberspace of Ukraine as an integral part of the state's information security. The necessity of building an effective cyber security system as one of the main components of national information security in Ukraine became ever apparent after the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the invasion of Russian troops in the territory of the Ukrainian Donbas. The problem of cyberspace research and the analysis of cyber security is characterized by a number of uncertainties both in the terminology itself and in the regulatory sphere. For further reference, research into the interconnection of information security and cyber security needs clear form in order to understand the essence of the concepts of ""cyber security"" and ""information space"". This, in turn, can only be done when the essence of the concept of cyberspace is clearly stated. The term ""cyberspace"" was first coined by Canadian science-fiction writer William Gibson in 1982 in the Burning Chrome novel. In 1984, this concept was further elaborated on in the work Neuromancer. According to Gibson, cyberspace is a well-balanced hallucination that is experienced daily by billions of conventional operators around the world. There are many interpretations of the concept in the scientific literature of Cyberspace. In this case, a myriad understanding of this concept is inherent in the regulatory and legal sphere: practically every country in its legislation gives its own definition. For example, 1) in accordance with an international standard , cyberspace is the complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form; 2) in accordance with US regulatory framework , cyberspace is a field characterized by the ability to use electronic and electromagnetic means to memorize, modify and exchange data through network systems and related physical infrastructure; 3) in accordance with official documents of the European Union , cyberspace is the virtual space in which the electronic data of the world's personal computers circulate; 4) According to UK Cyber Security Strategy documents, cyberspace is all forms of networks and digital activity, including content and activities, implemented through digital networks; 5) according to German Cyber Security Strategy cyberspace is all the information infrastructure available through the internet outside any territorial boundaries. In general, most definitions boil down to understanding cyber security as a state of cyberspace security of the state as a whole, or of some of its infrastructure against external influences and risks, which ensures their sustainable development, as well as the timely detection, prevention and neutralization of real and potential challenges, cyber interventions and threats to personal, corporate and /or national interests. Russia's hybrid aggression against Ukraine developed into an active phase in early 2014, but long before the direct military intervention it was accompanied by tactical information support, which contained a wide range of information and psychological influences on the population of Ukraine and Russia, more or less since Ukraine's Declaration of Independence in 1991. Estimates from Ukrainian experts also indicate that Russia has always worked to weaken Ukraine, and this activity has been particularly intensified with the coming to power of Putin. The main focus of the war on the hybrid nature of the Russian Federation against Ukraine is the information sphere, however, Russian influence is also exercised on the cultural, humanitarian, military, financial, energy and diplomatic and economic spheres, as well as cyberspace. This proves that Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine is aimed at non-military spheres, and its primary focus is outreach, where cyber aggression is a key component. Analysis of recent research and publications The study of the security of cyberspace as a component of information security has become the subject of scientific research by many foreign scientists: J. It should be also noted that since the beginning of the Russian armed aggression Ukrainian scientists have also become interested in this issue, in particular, M. I would like to mention separately the works of researchers of the National Institute for Strategic Studies under the President of Ukraine, especially B. Javors'ka Ontology of War and Peace: Security, Strategy, Meaning ; Putin's regime: reboot-2018 / M. Razumny , and D. Dubov Cyberspace as a new dimension of geopolitical rivalry . That said, despite a fairly large number of studies and publications on the topic of information and cyber security, analysis shows that researchers have considered the general issues of developing a national system of cybernetic security as an integral element of the information security system. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to study the national dimensions of cyberspace as a component of Ukraine's information security. Presentation of the main research material For the first time, Russian cyber threats and possible cyber attacks began to peak during the 2016 US election campaign, when, according to many researchers, the intervention of Russian hackers and the hacking of the electronic mailbox of the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, influenced the electoral campaign and electoral sympathies of Americans. However, these were only echoes of a long and purposeful campaign of Russian intelligence services, which increasingly involve cyberspace and electronic media of mass communication for espionage and undermining the interests of the Kremlin. At the same time, hacker attacks on government structures and industrial facilities occurred earlier, and not only within the same continent. The United States reacted to Russia's hacking attacks by introducing new sanctions against companies and individuals thus prohibiting any operations within the US financial system. Among the examples of ""malicious and destabilizing activity"", the US Department of the Treasury calls the NotPetya virus an attack on power distribution networks. In February 2018, the White House said that the damage caused by the NotPetya virus in Europe, Asia, and America was calculated to be billions of dollars. The NotPetya attack in the White House was named a part of the Kremlin's efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, which is increasingly demonstrating Russia's participation in the ongoing conflict . Russia, however, denies involvement in the attack and indicates that Russian companies have also suffered from it. However, British ministers also said that Russian cyber attacks are NotPetya . On the first day of the spread of the virus, June 27, it struck 2,000 organizations; 75% of the victims fell to Ukraine. Ukrainian ministries, police, banks, Boryspil airport, Kyiv metro, media, mobile operators, medical companies suffered. The virus blocked computers and demanded money in exchange for restoring access to locked programs. British prime minister Theresa May blamed President Putin in November last year for trying to ""sow discord"" in the west: through interference in elections, dissemination of disinformation and cyberwar. Theresa May has accused Russia of meddling in elections and planting fake stories in the media in an extraordinary attack on its attempts to ""weaponise information"" in order to sow discord in the west. Listing Russia's attempts to undermine western institutions in recent years, she said: ""I have a very simple message for Russia. We know what you are doing. And you will not succeed"" . American and British officials said that the attacks affected a wide range of organizations including internet service providers, private businesses and critical infrastructure providers. They did not identify victims or provide details on the impact of the attacks. ""When we see malicious cyber activity, whether it be from the Kremlin or other malicious nation-state actors, we are going to push back"", said Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator . Earlier, in February 2018, German officials also accused Russia of hacking attacks on government sites. In particular, according to media reports, hackers from the grouping of APT28, also known as Fancy Bears, successfully attacked the German Foreign and Defence Ministries at the end of February. They entered the so-called Berlin-Bonn Information Network , which is used by the Federal Chancellery of Germany, the federal ministries and services security, as well as the Bundestag and the Bundesrat . Along with the statements of the official agencies of the United States, Great Britain and Germany, NATO has adopted a consolidated decision on Russia's destabilizing role in the modern world, which is expressed by a long illegal and illegitimate annexation of the Crimea, violations of sovereign borders with the use of force; the intentional destabilization of the situation in eastern Ukraine; the sudden launch of large-scale military exercises contrary to the spirit of the Vienna Document and provocative military action at NATO's borders, including in the regions of the Baltic and Black Seas and the Eastern Mediterranean; irresponsible and aggressive nuclear rhetoric, as well as repeated violations NATO Allied airspace . In the communique after the Warsaw summit, NATO noted that cyber attacks present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack. We agreed in Wales that cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective defence. Now, in Warsaw, we reaffirm NATO's defensive mandate and recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea. It will support NATO's broader deterrence and defence: cyber defence will continue to be integrated into operational planning and Alliance operations and missions, and we will work together to contribute to their success. Furthermore, it will ensure the more effective organization of NATO's cyber defence and better management of resources, skills, and capabilities»"" . However, these examples of violations of the national cyberspace of Western powers are just the tip of the iceberg, which hides years of agency activity and Russian attempts to control the media. Undoubtedly, Ukraine is the main target for cyber crime and cyber attacks by Russia. This is the meaning of the hybrid nature of the war, which, besides the military component itself, also includes powerful information campaigns, disinformation, fake news and hacking activities. Purposeful cyber attacks against Ukraine began simultaneously with the events of March 2014, when Russia virtually annexed the Crimea by bringing its troops into the peninsula . At the same time as the annexation of the Crimea there began in Ukraine massive DDoS attacks carried out by the so-called CyberBerkut. CyberBerkut is a modern organized group of pro-Russian hacktivists. The group became locally known for a series of publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service attacks on the Ukrainian government, and western or Ukrainian corporate websites . During the period of 2014-2017, about 6,000 hacker attacks were committed against Ukraine . Undoubtedly, the most powerful of the famous cyber attacks took place on June 27, 2017 . A series of powerful cyber attacks using the Petya malware began on 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms. Similar infections were reported in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. ESET estimated on 28 June 2017 that 80% of all infections were in Ukraine, with Germany being the second hardest hit with about 9% . On 28 June 2017, the Ukrainian government stated that the attack was halted. On 30 June 2017, the Associated Press reported that experts agreed that Petya was masquerading as ransomware, while it was actually designed to cause maximum damage, with Ukraine being the main target . The cyber attack was based on a modified version of the Petya ransomware. As with the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, Petya uses the EternalBlue exploit previously discovered in older versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. When Petya is executed, it encrypts the Master File Table of the hard drive and forces the computer to restart. It then displays a message to the user, telling them their files are now encrypted and to send US$300 in bitcoin to one of three wallets to receive instructions to decrypt their computer. At the same time, the software exploits the Server Message Block protocol in Windows to infect local computers on the same network, and any remote computers it can find. Security experts found that the version of Petya used in the Ukraine cyber attacks had been modified, and subsequently has been named NotPetya or Nyetna to distinguish it from the original malware. NotPetya encrypted all of the files on the infected computers, not just the Master File Table, and in some cases the computer's files were completely wiped or rewritten in a manner that could not be undone through decryption. Some security experts saw that the software could intercept passwords and perform administrator-level actions that could further ruin computer files. They also noted that the software could identify specific computer systems and bypass infection of those systems, suggesting the attack was more surgical in its goal. There also has yet to be discovered a ""kill switch"" as there was with the WannaCry software, which would immediately stop its spread. According to Nicholas Weaver of the University of California, the hackers had previously compromised MeDoc, that is made it into a remote-control Trojan, and then they were willing to burn this asset to launch this attack . During the attack, the radiation monitoring system at Ukraine's Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant went offline. Several Ukrainian ministries, banks, metro systems and state-owned enterprises were affected. In the infected computers, important computer files were overwritten and thus permanently damaged, despite the malware's displayed message to the user indicating that all files could be recovered ""safely and easily"" by meeting the attackers' demands and making the requested payment in Bitcoin currency. The attack came on the eve of the Ukrainian public holiday, Constitution Day (celebrating the anniversary of the approval by the Verkhovna Rada of the Constitution of Ukraine on 28 June 1996). Most government offices were to be empty, allowing the cyber attack to spread without interference. In addition, some security experts saw the ransomware engage in wiping the affected hard drives rather than encrypting them, which would be a further disaster for companies affected by this. A short time before the cyber attack began, it was reported that an intelligence officer and head of a special forces unit, Maksym Shapoval, was killed in Kiev by a car bomb. A former government adviser in Georgia and Moldova, Molly K. McKew, believed this assassination was related to the cyber attack . On 30 June, the Security Service of Ukraine reported it had seized the equipment that had been used to launch the cyber attack, claiming it to have belonged to Russian agents responsible for launching the attack. On 1 July 2017, the SBU claimed that available data showed that the same perpetrators who in Ukraine in December 2016 attacked the financial system, transport and energy facilities of Ukraine were the same hacking groups who attacked Ukraine on 27 June 2017. This testifies to the involvement of the special services of the Russian Federation in this attack it concluded . Ukraine claims that hacking Ukrainian state institutions is part of what they describe as a ""hybrid war"" by Russia on Ukraine . According to reports cited in January 2018, the United States Central Intelligence Agency claimed Russia was behind the cyber attack, with Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate having designed NotPetya . Similarly, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence accused Russia in February 2018 of launching the cyber attack, and that by attacking systems in Ukraine, the cyber attack spread and affected major systems in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Russia denied its involvement, pointing out that Russian systems were also impacted by the attack . The reaction of the Ukrainian state to such actions by its northern neighbour was predictable. First of all, the role of the Department of Cyber Police of the National Police of Ukraine was strengthened - the inter-regional territorial body of the National Police of Ukraine, which is part of the structure of the criminal police of the National Police and in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine, ensures the implementation of state policy in the field of combating cybercrime. This division specializes in the prevention, detection, termination and disclosure of criminal offences where the mechanisms of preparation, execution or concealment of which, involves the use of electronic computers , telecommunication and computer Internet networks and systems . On July 19, 2017, within the framework of the project ""Capacity building for cyber police"", representatives of the OSCE Project Coordination in Ukraine transferred 194 units of specialized equipment to the units of the cyber police of the National Police of Ukraine . In addition, repeated cyber attacks have prompted the accelerated adoption of a law in Ukraine on the protection of cyberspace, which was adopted on October 5, 2017, but came into force only on May 9, 2018 . This Law defines the legal and organizational foundations for ensuring the protection of the vital interests of: a person and a citizen; society and the state, as well as the national interests of Ukraine in cyberspace. To that end, the main goals, directions and principles of state policy in the field of cyber security; the powers of state bodies, enterprises, institutions, organizations, persons and citizens in this area; as well as the main principles of coordination of their work on the provision of cyber security have been laid out in this legislation. The law explicitly interprets the meaning of the notion of cyberspace - the environment , which provides opportunities for communication and/ or implementation of social relations, formed as a result of the operation of compatible communication systems and the provision of electronic communications using the Internet and/or other networks' global data networks ; and cyber defence - a set of organizational, legal, engineering and technical measures, as well as measures of cryptographic and technical protection of information aimed at preventing cyber incidents, detecting and protecting against cyber attacks, eliminating their consequences, restoring the sustainability and reliability of the functioning of communication and technological systems. The law also stipulates that the main subjects of the national system of cyber security are the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, the National Police of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence agencies, and the National Bank of Ukraine . The objects of critical infrastructure are enterprises and organizations that provide services in the economic sphere, in the energy and chemical industry, transport and information and communication industries, utility companies, healthcare, or objects of potentially dangerous technologies and industries. The coordination of activities is carried out by the President of Ukraine with the help of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, which he heads. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine ensures the formation and implementation of state policy in the field of cyber security . Thus, the Ukrainian authorities have taken a number of steps to protect the national cyberspace, both normative and practical. However, this does not reduce the level of threats that cyber attacks pose. After all, despite the adoption and enactment of the law on the protection of domestic cyberspace and the creation of the Department of Cyber police and a number of other actions by Ukraine, attempts at cyber attacks on our country have not been stopped. Authorities in the United States said they broke up a potential digital attack called VPN Filter that affected half a million internet routers and could have caused widespread havoc in Ukraine. The US Justice Department said this was the most recent attack programmed by the Sofacy Group; the Russian hackers - also known as Fancy Bear - are suspected of being behind cyber attacks on several governments, international agencies and infrastructure providers. The largest number of infections was in Ukraine but affected routers in 54 countries, according to the technology company Cisco Systems and antivirus company Symantec, which cooperated with the FBI during the operation . Conclusion The study of cyberspace as a component of Ukraine's information security gives a number of important conclusions. For a long time, Cyber security and the cyber space of Ukraine was if little interest to domestic researchers and, therefore, civil servants. For more than 20 years, the young Ukrainian state did not waste its efforts on the formation of not only effective and reliable troops, but also information security. The government did not endeavour to strengthen the country's defence, and this probably only compounded its lack of progress in fighting corruption and the dominance of Russian media and intelligence. As a result, in the spring of 2014, after a long confrontation between the regime of Viktor Yanukovych and the citizens of Ukraine, Russia conducted special operations with the aim of annexing the Crimea and facilitating the war in Donbas. An important part of this campaign were raids for information and offensive actions carried out by cyber Russian hackers. The purpose of which was to paralyse government agencies and influence public opinion in Ukraine through Russian-controlled media. As a result of prolonged and massive cyber attacks, Ukrainian state structures, banking system, industrial facilities and private business suffered significant material and reputational losses. As a result, Ukraine began to realize the seriousness of cyber security as a component of national security. This contributed to the creation of a cyber police department, national cyber security strategy, the acceptance of a number of regulations on cyber security, and the overall strengthening of public defence for the protection of domestic cyberspace. At the moment, Ukraine is on the way to rethinking the role of cyber security and the formation of a national system for protecting against cyber threats."

Conceptual framework: Unintended Consequences in Context of Realism Paradigm Different states adopt policies in international arena to address their basic strategic and economic needs. The policies vary as per the geostrategic make-up of that particular region where the state’s self-interests are supposed to dwell. The actions by states to achieve their self-interests defines the rational foreign policy goals, which in other way sometimes couples with the irrational outcomes. Such irrational and unidentified outcomes as a result of the rational and defined actions are termed as the unintended consequences. Now, the questionarises what are unintended consequences? Phenomenologically, an American Sociologist, Robert K. Merton firstly used the term of unintended consequences in 1936 in his book On Social Structure and Science. According to his narrative, the unintended consequences are the unforeseen results due to actor’s determined and rational actions. He further explains that the unintended consequence is a sociallyconstructed concept which is indeed a relationship between action and latent existing but not yet developed function . This relationship determines the reaction as well as re-actions. Simply, they are unidentified results which are unavoidable (from the actor’s viewpoint). Vernon defines that “Unintended consequences may arise as the cumulative outcome of similar actions performed simultaneously or consecutively by a number of actors” . He explains the phenomenon of “unintended consequences” in political theory. Moreover, Karapin explains this concept in the following words; “Unintended consequences abound in politics and policy making due to the complexity of political and social life, and the incalculability of the strategic interactions that may emerge when a political actor tries to achieve a result. No agent has complete control in the messy realm of human affairs. No campaign, edict decision, or legislation can seamlessly produce its desired outcome, because every enactment engages a field of subjects with their own intentions, desires, purposes and strategies. Policies may trigger resistance or compensatory behavior.” In the context of International Relations, the unintended consequences approach come up to the regional and international actors which are influenced by the realist paradigm that shapes the reactionary approach of a particular action. It is actually a relation between an action and its reaction which further defines the scope of that action against the unwanted outcome. Generally speaking, the unintended consequences are figured more consistently as the undesired outcomes. But this statement can be disqualified by the fact that scope of the unintended consequences can only be defined after analyzing the rational and intended objectives of the foreign policy of an actor concerned. As it can be defined in terms of action and reaction with both positive and negative outcomes depending upon the intended desires of an actor. Therefore, it is argued that not all unintended consequences are undesirable, or in other words the unintended outcomes may add to the intended goals described in the rationally defined foreign policy objectives of a state. Studying unintended consequences is a futile effort unless the broad-based causes of such consequence are ascertained. As mentioned above that unintended consequences is a relationship between a rational action and a latent function that eventually shape the nature of possible unintended outcomes. For causes of such consequences, Merton has described two causing variables: 1) intentions exhibited by human beings, which drags in the classical-realism in the concept of unintended consequences, and; 2) System or circumstances, where the rational actions are employed in pursuit of the desired result as per the Waltz’s system theory. The human behavior influences the nature of unintended consequences by resorting to rational actions that ultimately results in the outcomes that may be irrational or in contradiction to the wanted outcomes of the actor. Vernon has extended the phenomenon of variables for the changing nature of unintended consequences and defined two variables: variety of terms and diversity in context. The changing human behavior triggers the diverse system or environment to change and produce unwanted outcomes. Such a case would qualify the approach of Vernon that human behavior is independent and causes the entire context to change. For example invasions in Afghanistan by the USSR and later by the US were a rational approach held by the foreign policies of both superpowers in pursuit of some limited desired outcomes. Here the states acted in a region with a diversity of other states that enabled the rational actions to result in the delivery of unintended consequences. The motive behind foreign intervention in Afghanistan was limited to certain economic and strategic objectives in Central and South Asia. But it also resulted in some grave and long-term unintended consequences for the region including the proxy war between Pakistan and India, which proved to be unintended and unwanted outcomes of the rational approach of the foreign intervention in Afghanistan. The unintended consequences of the foreign interventions in Afghanistan Geopolitically and historically, Afghanistan has been critically located at the crossroads of South and Central Asia and the Middle East. In the early twentieth century, the renowned Indian poet, Mohammad Iqbal, portrayed Afghanistan as “the Heart of Asia,” while British India’s Viceroy, Lord Curzon , called this land “the Cockpit of Asia” . Moreover, Vogelsang states that Afghanistan is considered the “Crossroads of Civilizations” through which warriors and traders from surrounding areas - Central Asia , the Middle East , the Indian subcontinent, Siberia and the Ottoman - took this passage to their destinations for gaining wealth and prestige mainly through bloody looting . Further, Tanner has marked Afghanistan “Crossroad of Empires”, but during the Ahmad Shah Durrani’s period, the neighboring people were fearsome from the Afghans because a vast Afghan empire emerged. Afghanistan has been blocked and remained in isolation from the other empires’ influences until the new empires of Britain and Russia emerged. Therefore, Afghanistan has hosted several overtly-and-covertlyheld geostrategic competitions and remained a constant target of the unwelcomed drawbacks of the intentional policy actions of the old Great Game players adopted by Russia and Britain throughout this classical geopolitical rivalry. The irrational consequences of continued great game politics created a security dilemma in Afghanistan even in the 20th and 21st centuries. Afghan land had been a cockpit which has been witnessing permanent power jockeying and destruction due to wars or war-like conditions . While, Afghanistan’s history is critically analyzed after studying the historical archives, the three defined eras of foreign interventions are obvious which contributed a lot in the political and socio-economic destruction of Afghanistan as a country: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan of 1979; postCold War era when the regional players Pakistan and India got involved in Afghanistan; and US invasion of Afghanistan of 9/11 incident. The critical content analysis of Afghanistan’s history during the aforesaid time-periods comparatively helps to untie a lot of endless unintended consequences, which directly affected the regional security and geopolitical dynamics that directly or indirectly put serious and grave undesired impacts on South Asian region as well. The factual study of these highlighted historical events and developments show that states executes their rationally oriented foreign policies to attain some defined objectives, which as per the law of unintended consequences, turns out with some undesired outcomes. To counter such undesired results, state resorts to irrational means and so forth. For example, the natural engagement of Islamabad in favor of the US in 1980s was meant to contain the Soviet expansionism, but such an engagement triggered India to exploit anarchic disorder in Afghanistan for her own designs against Pakistan. Such a reactionary approach of India was balanced by a counter-reactionary approach by Pakistan and paved a way for a full scale proxy conflict between Pakistan and India. Growth of opium poppy by taliban’s regime A direct Soviet intervention in Afghanistan triggered the United States , in the 1980s, to fight a decade-long war in Afghanistan by arming and financing the mujahedeen forces. The US poured billions of dollars into the war and was successful in driving the Soviets out of the country. The monetary support provided by the Central Investigation Agency was in billions and thus, the insurgent groups in Afghanistan had to get heavy funds for their fight against the Soviet Union. The ""secret war"" in Afghanistan was heavily funded by the United States, but the irony is that the official funds provided by the CIA through the Pakistan’s intelligence agency named Inter-Services Intelligence to the mujahedeen were only 10% of the total cost of the “Afghan War” . The former Afghan President Barbak Karmal highlighted the elements which funded and trained these forces in Afghanistan and made destructions by this war to the country at large, in his interview to an Egyptian journalist. Here, a following excerpt has been taken from primary sources. The United States has provided the counter-revolutionary elements with more than $1 billion in order to kill the Afghans and destroy the country. This year alone the U.S. Congress allocated $480 million to fiance the “undeclared” war against us. The amount of aid the United States has given to the counter-revolutionary elements is more than 6 times the amount it gave to Afghanistan as aid in 20 years before the revolution. The other countries such as West Germany, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia, Britain and France gave financial aid to the tune of $800 million . The question is where that 90% of the cost of the Afghan War did come for fighting the Soviets. The answer is obviously hidden in the Afghan War that is presented through the lenses of the production of Opium Poppy on the arable land of Afghanistan. The mujahedeen forces used an extensive amount of money earned by the Opium economy of Afghanistan to afford that decade-long unprecedented effort against the Red Army . Finally, the war ended with the withdrawal of the Red Army; but unfortunately, the tradition of using Opium Poppy and then heroin as a source of fueling insurgencies continued. The cultivation of Opium Poppy as a main crop in Afghanistan was resulted when the refugees returned to their homeland and saw their fields with crops which were destroyed by the Soviet forces previously in the 1980s and thus, preferred to grow Opium as their main source of income . Takeover of the Taliban of major parts of Afghanistan including Kabul boosted their influence allover in Afghanistan. They imposed strict Islamic Laws in the country, which enforced their main objective of making Afghanistan a purely Islamic Emirate. Initially, the Taliban were reluctant by their Islamic ideology perspectives to allow any kind of Opium growth and trade. However, after gaining power and coming to know the geopolitical and strategic realities concerning their conflicts with different groups and funding for these conflicts, they had to turn towards Opium and make the Opiate economy of Afghanistan as their perfect source of funding for their military equipment and other necessary things to make their movement survive . There were two main things that turned the Taliban towards cultivation of Islamic banned Opium and their trade: Since, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the only countries that provided them with funds and other military support , but that support was insufficient in confronting the Northern Alliance – heavily funded by Russia, Iran and India. Hence, the first motive behind supporting Opiate was to fulfill their monetary needs which would allow the Taliban to arm their fighters with modern arms and ammunitions. The Taliban were facing trouble from the local warlords and to earn their support, the Taliban had to allow the Opiate trade by the warlords who handed their arms to the Taliban in exchange for the cultivation of Opiate . The Opiate economy, however, benefited both the Taliban and the opposing groups such as the Northern Alliance, since they both needed to fund their militancy. The Taliban, however, were the most benefited group in Afghanistan from the heroin and Opiate business with most of the production coming out of the Taliban controlled areas as reported by the US and the UNDCP in 1997 with almost 96 percent of heroin yielded by the Taliban held areas . The Taliban have avoided any public announcement of Opiate being allowed in Afghanistan during their rule from 1996 to 2001. Even though, they strongly criticized the Opium cultivation and growth by the farmers and warlords, and even hinted at strong punishment for the violator of what they call as the decree of Islam and the Holy Quran. The Taliban Foreign Ministry stated on September 10, 1997, that “The Islamic State of Afghanistan informs all compatriots that, as the use of heroin and hashish are not permitted in Islam; they are reminded once again that they should strictly refrain from growing, using, and trading in hashish and heroin. Anyone who violates this order shall be meted out a punishment in line with the lofty Mohammad and Sharia law and thus shall not be entitled to launch a complaint” . Since, their takeover of Kabul, the Taliban were facing a serious problem of the international isolation which they tried to acquire at any cost. They tried relentlessly to make their ally Pakistan convinced the international community in granting recognition to the Taliban regime, especially from the US. In an attempt to get a recognition from the United States and the United Nations, the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, in an appeasing move banned all kinds of Opium trade and production in 2001, which caused a decrease in Opium production from 82,000 hectares in 2000 to just 7,600 hectares in 2001 . In other words, the Opium production was declined by more than 90 percent. Most of the Opium production during the ban by the Taliban belonged to the areas held by the Northern Alliance which accounted 83% of the total Opium production. However, the US military campaign against the Taliban regime in the late 2001 caused an extensive surge in Opium production and allowed the farmers to cultivate the once banned Opium Poppy in Afghanistan. The immense increase in cultivation of Opium Poppy and the heroin trade across the region once again touched the sky. It did not only affect the regional neighboring countries including Pakistan, but also caused an increment in the heroin usage in the West in general and the US in particular. The number of heroin users in the US itself increased from 189,000 to almost 4million in 2016 which had dramatically changed thedrug absorption throughout the US-led international invasion since 2001 . Thus, the Opium phenomenon added to one of the most important and unnoticed unintended consequences of the rational approach of global engagement in Afghanistan and reassertion of the global powers militaryinterventionism. However, they didn’t liberate the Afghans and pushed them socially in the darkness of ignorance. Plantation of terrorism, al-qaeda and global jihad: the usliberal interventionism One of the highly regarded unintended consequences after the Soviets’ withdrawal was the establishment of a new set of terrorism in the form of Al-Qaeda. Once the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton confessed for the first time about the US responsibility for generation of mujahedeen against Communism and continuous support to the Taliban in NGG, when she admitted to ABC TV on November 12, 2010 that: “Part of what we are fighting against right now, the United States created. We created the Mujahidin force against the Soviet Union . We trained them, we equipped them, we funded them, including somebody named Osama bin Laden.... And it didn’t work out so well for us” . The story begins when the mujahedeen fought a successful holy war against the Soviets with the US backing and rigidly repulsed their occupation. They included a considerable number of the Arab fighters who joined the Afghan counterparts in this war. One of such fighters was Osama bin Laden, who had travelled all the way to Afghanistan from his home town in Saudi Arabia to assist his Afghan colleagues. He was initially introduced by the head of the Saudi’s Intelligence, Prince Turki Bin Faisal in 1980 , to assist the mujahedeen in their fight against the Soviet Union. He did a major part in defeating the Red Army, since he invested his expertise in managing the mujahedeen affairs and received funds from the Saudi government until the Soviets were back to their country in the late 1989. With funds from his family’s billion dollar construction business, bin Laden dug caves and deep tunnel complexes in the mountains of Afghanistan, specifically in Khost and Jalalabad. With setting up highly advance depots and complexes for the Afghan War fighters, he also started setting up a separate training camp for the Arab-Afghan mujahedeen fighters which hinted at the formation of a new organization for the Global Jihad . The whole story, from Saudi Arabia to Global Jihad, has been described by Bin Laden himself, he said; “To counter these atheist Russians, the Saudis chose me as their representative in Afghanistan. I settled in Pakistan in Afghan border region. There I received volunteers who came from the Saudi Kingdom and from all over the Arab and Muslim countries. I set up my first camp where these volunteers were trained by Pakistani and American officers. The weapons were supplied by the Americans, the money from the Saudis. I discovered that it was not enough to fight in Afghanistan , but that we had to fight on all fronts, communist or Western oppression” . In August 1988, after assisting the Afghan mujahedeen against the Soviets, bin Laden huddled up various extremist groups including both Arab and Afghan mujahedeen, which resulted in the emergence of an idea of the Global Jihad and a platform to converge Jihad fighters in the name of “Al-Qaeda” . This group then moved to Sudan in early 1990s and established contacts with some potentially capable terrorist organizations across the Middle East and North Africa assembling thousands of radicals and extremist figures. After takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in late 1996, bin Laden founded the same shelter again, which he left following the departure of the Soviets. The Al-Qaeda started operations under the manifesto of the Global Jihad and carried out some vicious attacks in the world including the deadly attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 . The terrorism of AlQaeda never stopped and enforced the capability of their fighters, which led to the attacks on Twin Towers, the deadliest in the US history by September 11, 2001. US liberal interventionism or great power military interventionism As stated by professor of International Islamic University Islamabad during his interview, “any superpower or major power tries to create reasons in order to have its own excuse for intervention for a specific matter. Today, it is named as liberal interventionism such as Operation Endurance was launched by the US administration in light of Global War on Terror for liberating Afghanistan from terrorists and Iraq from the WMDs. It is not the people of that concerned country liberating from the tyrant regime, but the matter of fact is that that particular rational action is actually maximization of power that is done to serve the interests of that power intervened” . The rational approach of Bush’s GWOT policy shifted unlawful great power’s military intervention adventurism to lawful long-term counter-terrorism policy under the US grand strategy agenda for Afghanistan and South Asia. The emergence of the terrorist organization of Al-Qaeda was nothing but a perverse outcome of the foreign intervention and misadventures of the superpowers that started in late 1970s with the invasion of Afghanistan by the communist USSR and anti-communist measures by the US and its allies. The destruction of Afghanistan and international community went on, even after the horrific attacks on the US, and the Global War on Terror as one of the unintended consequences of the foreign intervention still exist to absorb the rest of global peace and stability and is operating with the same label of Al-Qaeda in various parts of the Middle East and Africa. The emergence of Al-Qaeda did not only lead to the destabilization of Afghanistan but also changed the geopolitical dynamics and security patterns of the entire region. Afghanistan was again chosen as the main base for what their founders have asserted as the Global Jihad and thus, made Afghanistan a focal point for the War against the international terrorism. Pakistan was again a frontline ally to fight this war, initiated in the beginning of twenty-first century. Pakistan affected directly from superpower’s interventionism in the name of GWOT and “so-called” global Jihad . Buzan and Wæver perfectly portray the picture of this great power or superpower interventionism after 9/11 in these following words: “Almost nobody disputes that the end of the Cold War had a profound impact on the whole pattern of international security but, more than a decade after the transition, the character of the post-Cold War security order still remains hotly contested...since decolonization, the regional level of security has become both more autonomous and more prominent in international politics, and that the ending of the Cold War accelerated this process. Cold War, both the remaining superpower and the other great powers had less incentive, and displayed less will, to intervene in security affairs outside their own regions. The terrorist attack on the United States in 2001 may well trigger some reassertion of great power interventionism” . According to Pakistani analysts, holistically, the US take excuses in the garb of liberal interventionalist approach to reach any country where there is instability . For example in Iraq, there was internal striving between Saddam and the rest forces. But after the US intervention for liberating the Iraqi people from Saddam, it could not have paved the grounds for peace. In fact, Iraq was in a peaceful situation during Saddam’s era and today it is practically fragmented and unstable. “In Afghanistan, the US doesn’t want to stay anymore, but it is not eliminating its full presence becauseit doesn’t want to give space to Russia and China. With the name of liberation, the US has only deceived Afghanis and they are not dear to the US as well. Merely the country’s interests are dear to the US. The US intervention has undone the nationalcharacter of Afghanistan” . Re-conceptualization of the great game notion into new idea of the grand great game The Great Game concept is very well-known. But there is a long history in construction of any idea. The Grand Great Game or the 3G idea has been constructed and re-conceptualized in light of geopolitical dynamics and security patterns emerged in the post-9/11 era, since the term New Great Game was coined after the disintegration of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. A Pakistani professor Azmat Hayat Khan quoted Major Hoggerty that the old great game is defined as “the struggle between Great Britain and Russia, to gain influence in Afghanistan was known as the great game” . The OGG geopolitics was different from the New Great Game on the following points: The OGG was only between two powers, Great Britain and Czarist Russia, whereas the NGG has more than six players, Russia, US, India, Pakistan, China and Iran. There was no economy or religion involved in the old Great Game, whereas, now it is all dominated by economic interests and religion. In OGG, Afghanistan was used as a buffer to block hostile influence, where as of now, in the NGG it is being used as a jumping pad to achieve their objectives . In the OGG, Great Britain and Russia had an understanding that Russia would not interfere south of Hindu-Kush in Afghanistan, and Britain would not interfere north of Hindu-Kush. After 9/11, when the US invaded Afghanistan, it made the matter more complicated and grandeur, and has made it very hard for the regional countries, to come to some understanding. They neither the US nor do other regional countries trust each other and under these circumstances, there can be no peace in Afghanistan. Therefore, this 3G idea was approved by the most of research participants, since a sample size of 15 research respondents has been chosen for conducting interviews from senior and junior university doctorate professors, public-sector professionals, media persons, and doctorate scholars of International Relations from Pakistan, India, United States, Estonia, Australia, Singapore, Afghanistan and Iran . Few examples with comments of these participants are as follows a senior Professor expressed his views during interview to the author that “Using the term Great Game is a bit misleading because apart from the fact that today's inter-state competition is taking place in the same geographic neighborhood as the original GG, there is very little similarity. Having said that, you could of course use your 3G nomenclature but you would need to explain right from the beginning the differences and the similarities with the original term . The renowned Afghanistan-Pakistan expert, Marvin G. Weinbaum reflected that “Let it suffice to say that what these games have most in common is that Afghanistan serves as the focal point of larger regional contestations, all carrying lasting consequences for Afghanistan itself. In contrast to the Great Game and Cold War, rather than its being a competition essentially between two major antagonists, the new game encompasses multiple actors including, importantly, non-state ones. The 9/11 brought these non-state actors clearly to the forefront. Moreover, the current game, with its strategic economic and ideological dimensions does not fit easily into traditional realpolitik thinking. That said, the “game” metaphor may have lost its utility. The devising of term grand great game would not be inappropriate if in well defining it you have justified its use” . Today’s chess game is created neither for having the direct globe-spanning empire building nor keeping the contending chess players in balance . Rather, the master of this game has tried to buy political influence indirectly by devising new strategies, new tactics and new game rules to content with new players, such as the sole superpower with allies has moved towards gaining the direct influence in Afghanistan in disguise of countering the global challenge of terrorism under the long-term grand strategy of the GWOT. This point is truly expressed by Rubin and Rashid . “The Great Game is no fun anymore. The term “Great Game” was used by nineteenth-century British imperialists to describe the British Russian struggle for position on the chessboard of Afghanistan and Central Asia, a contest with a few players, mostly limited to intelligence forays and short wars fought on horseback with rifles, and with those living on the chessboard largely bystanders or victims. More than a century later, the game continues. But now, the number of players has exploded, those living on the chessboard have become involved, and the intensity of the violence and the threats it produces affect the entire globe. The Great Game can no longer be treated as a sporting event for distant spectators. It is time to agree on some new rules.” Another senior Pakistani expert also is in favor of the reconstruction of new idea in the following words; As the geo-politics of the region has changed mostly after 9/11 and new players have entered the game, the word “Grand Great Game” would be appropriate. This is how political words develop with changing time and geopolitics. International politics before and after 9/11 will never be the same. Apart from politics and economics, religion has entered into international politics and in some areas, it is playing the dominant role and it is connected to each other all over the world e.g. Africa, Afghanistan and Syria etc. Times have changed, players have changed; but the methods, tactics and strategies are the same. Addition of this word grand great game would be a big boost to Political Science terminologies and once you write it would be quoted by others and this would pave the way for further research and studies” . Another senior Pakistani analyst slightly differs with the aforementioned viewpoint that this great game geopolitics is continued with new character and new interests of new players. The nomenclature of the OGG and NGG can be changed, but definitely impact would be the same that is power politics” . Another practitioner articulated in this way. “During the Cold War, in the same battle ground, United States replaced British and the aim was twofold: US wanted its revenge from USSR for its failing in Vietnam and at the same time, US was denying the USSR, an access to warm waters of Indian Ocean. Now the battle ground is same. More players have joined i.e. China and India, in addition to existing players. U.S. and India also want to extend the battle ground to Pakistan. The term should be changed and have correctly been called it the “grand game”. I fully agree with you.” . Similarly, a senior Indian professor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University gives their support to this idea. For example, “the Grand Great Game is more appropriate as it is different as the Great Game involved UK and then USA in the Cold War and focused mostly on the USSR. The 3G not only involves Russia, Central Asian states plus, China, India, Iran and others” . Another senior Indian professor maintained that “As regards content of conflict, then it was for imperial and ideological pursuits and now it is for geo-economic gains, controlling trade and energy corridors besides worth the $trillion untapped mineral resources of Afghanistan. South Asian geography is, therefore, impacting the regional politics and international relations, since major competing players of the present “Great Game” are international, whereas India, Pakistan and Iran are the peripheral ones. [No issue in using the word “Great Game” as it points to the clash on interest. Nevertheless scholars must have used it for explanation in relation to the old great game” . According to the perspective of Iranian participant, “Today, there is also a great game in the form of a game for power. The issues of terrorism and extremism, Al-Qaeda, Taliban and ISIS, as well as the rise of India and China as two major powers, are among the issues that have affected the security scenario in the region. Afghanistan has been the arena for proxy wars between various countries, including Russia-the United States and India – Pakistan and etc., to reduce their rival's influence. And now the great game between Russia, China and Pakistan on the one side and the United States and India on the other hand are strengthening” . Unlikely, Afghan participant goes into detail that first of all, some of the actors have switched and some new actors have entered the scene. Afghanistan was a buffer state during the old great game. But during part of the Cold War and what some call now new great game, Afghanistan is one of the focal points. The main axis of the Cold War and the new great game are the same - Russia - but their allies have switched or seemed to be in a state of switching sides. Pakistan, for example, is entering or posing to be entering the Russian-led camp. In the existing situation, the geostrategic interests, more than anything else, are driving the agendas of different countries and so far as the Af-Pak region is concerned, the situation is getting complex with the active involvement of India-Pakistan rivalries more than any time before, US-Iran trouble, Iran-Saudi rivalry, and the active quest for hegemony by the United States and Russia and somewhat silent, but overt struggle by China. It is not going to go away any time soon. “I would prefer call it new Great Game than Grand Great Game” . Unintended consequences of the 3G A Professor of John Hopkins University explained that “I think that the term Great Game has some merit, insofar as it suggests that there is a complex rivalry playing out among major powers in Eurasia, with Afghanistan as a central theatre of that competition. Afghanistan is not, however, currently the object of the competition in a serious way. No country wants to control Afghanistan or seeks a permanent presence there. The investment by the US and NATO has been driven by counterterrorism concerns, and the behavior by other countries has largely been a reaction to that US/NATO presence” . Yet, the consequences of this 3G struggle are clearly seen. “The notion of a single chess player is equally false, especially in Central Asia, where dominant states and local states are all alike weak” , because “the emergent new structure of international security is 1 + 4 + regions” (Buzan and Wæver, 2003: 40), including the US (the international superpower, 4 rising powers and other different regional players. Therefore, Nye describe that “the world politics today is like three-dimensional chess game. At the top level, military power among states is unipolar, but at the middle level, of interstate economic relations, the world is multipolar and has been so far more than that a decade. At the bottom level of transnational relations . Power is chaotically distributed and diffused to non-state actors” . Moreover, the trend of confrontation and cooperation in the 3G under the umbrella of grand strategic partnerships are continued. On the one hand, states’ strategic interests have a collision with the others, but also they are collaborating for humanitarian assistance, countering terrorism and peacemaking, which provide the imperial states an opportunity to manipulate the weak ones. Or, they use the geography of the latter for their geopolitical interests against their rival. Moreover, the 3G is the intensification of the great game politics in changing geopolitical dynamics of the anarchic world order and the imposition of a grand strategic plan by major power to achieve their strategic goals. Lastly, the substantial impacts of this game on Afghanistan and the South Asian region are the outcomes of a war-oriented geostrategy policy of the major powers and their disorganized collective aggression by proxy wars. The Grand Great Game is a backfire of the US planned strategy of Cold War after the Soviet invasion. As indicated by a senior Indian professor that “the US responded by promoting and pitting Islamists/mujahedeen against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Saudi funds and Pakistani muscle turned the US strategy into success by evicting the Soviets from Afghanistan. But it had dangerous unintended consequences for the subcontinent, as a Frankenstein’s monster was created not in the US but in the region , which is still grappling with the rise of Islamic extremism and terrorism” . Therefore, this study establishes that the 3G is not a traditional chessboard game of international politics in which the only two powers are involved for pursuance of their grand agenda and imperial powers generally acted for ‘rational’ security and hegemony. Rather, in this game, multiple states have to design reactions and re-actions according to the perverse results of unplanned actions. Moreover, the unexpected responses are planned by taking past and present geopolitical developments into consideration. In changing dynamics of global geopolitics and complex interdependency, states usewar - direct or indirect - as a rational tool to gain political goals to cope with the challenges emerged as a result of security maximization and supremacy by socially-oriented means based on norms with realistic goals . Briefly, it is a combination of geo-economic and geocultural competitions - other than geopolitical contest of all great games and wars in Afghanistan. As stated by an Indian analyst, “Hence there is the need to look beyond geopolitics and see through the possibilities of geo-economic and geo-cultural cooperation in this 3G between India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Regional economic cooperation will bring both peace and prosperity to the region and its peoples” . Another expert described this topic in different words; , prior to 9-11 conflict between states was assumed to occur because of power clashes over conflicting interests . Post 9-11 revealed the extent to which cultural values, cultural worldview , and identity play a role in relations between states. Thus, there is a need for reconsideration of additional factors . The 3G is a boomerang of the US military interventionism in which Afghanistan has transformed into an international conflict with regional flavor . Changing of Afghan conflict into a full-fledged international conflict is one of the unseen consequences of the 3G. The Global War on Terror and proxy wars in Afghanistan are basically harbinger of this international nature of Afghan quagmire during the 3G, in which heterogeneous non-regional and regional players are fighting for their political goals under the cover of collective ‘war’ against terrorism. The players especially the US-led Western world, India, Japan, Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia and so forth are on one side engaged in cooperation to resolve the conflicting situation of terrorism in this land from decades, simultaneously they are busy in confrontation for their own strategic interests. The 3G is a dynamic conflict of interests and constant struggle for global primacy to be played by the United States even following 9/11, and this struggle shares geopolitical competition factor with all previous great game-like competitions. The international conflict of Afghanistan has transformed the nature of global rivalry of great game politics into a regional one in which regional players - Pakistan and India in South Asian region - are confronting each other for conflict of interests in the emerging current geopolitical developments of anarchic and complex interdependent world structure. As Buzan and Wæver proclaim that external major powers have played the regional great games in Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. However, the nature and scope of game being played in South Asia is different because the epicenter of this game is Afghanistan. Proxy conflict started becoming prominent feature of international politics partly after the end of Cold War and wholly after 9/11, as Hughes argue that “proxy warfare is in itself also partly a legacy of the Cold War” . In the current situation due to the US role in Afghanistan and de-hyphenation policy in South Asian, the two countries are entirely different for the US. “In post 9/11 scenario, US devised Af-Pak policy which was aimed at treating both the countries as one. So, in this case one can make out clearly that the Pakistan is state which is treated with sticks and India with carrots” . An Afghan expert states that “Afghanistan is part of India and Pakistan’s proxy war having replaced Kashmir as a battlefield between both the two rivals” . Pakistani political analyst explained, “There is a proxy war going on in Afghanistan between India and Pakistan. The fear and mistrust among these two countries is more than the actual conflict. Indian phobia among the Afghans is much more than what it actually is. The amount of money and energy the Indians are spending in Afghanistan, their achievements are nothing comparing the efforts and money Pakistan invested . An Indian political observer expressed, “I would stick to the official position of India, and which states clearly that it is in Afghanistan for Afghanistan. In the span of last four decades, India has not cultivated a proxy for itself in Afghanistan the same way as Pakistan has. This has come with its own advantages and disadvantages. But overall, it makes sense to conclude that India does not lead a proxy war in Afghanistan both because it does not want to and it cannot . But on the other hand, another senior Indian analyst at JNU maintained that “India decided to court Afghan governments to limit Pak influence in Kabul” . The US war on terror and a wave of terrorism inside Pakistan has diminished the latter’s policy of publicly supporting the Taliban fighters but have maintained a considerable influence over these groups in Afghanistan. India also enjoys the services of multiple groups inside the Afghan territory capable of mounting terrorist attacks on Pakistan’s economic and military installations. The proxy conflict between Pakistan and India in Afghanistan being a theatre for such a war has increasingly changed the geo-political and strategic dynamics of the region and has transformed the region around Afghanistan and Central Asia into a flashpoint for a possible military engagement among regional powers. A Pakistani expert maintained that “the power struggle between Indian and Pakistan in Afghanistan is complex because of the role of great major powers. Chinese aim does not fully coincide with Russians. At best we can broadly categorize these countries into two. The US and India want controlled and continued chaos in Afghanistan to contain and check rise of China and resurgence of Russia. China, Russia, and Pakistan want peace in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of United States and NATO foreign forces from Afghanistan” . Pakistani circles maintain that India is operating terrorist activities against Pakistan via Afghanistan and Islamabad possesses serious security apprehensions and concerns against the India’s strategic foothold in its backyard . A senior Pakistan professor expressed that India is encircling Pakistan through Afghanistan and Iran. India used this as opportunity and Kulbhushan Jadhav did all his activities in Baluchistan and Karachi through Iran. After 9/11, India has entered in Afghanistan extensively and Afghan soil is constantly being used against Pakistan. This is a stated policy of India that let’s bleed Pakistan and let’s use all anti-Pakistan elements within Pakistan and within Afghanistan against Pakistan for cause of terrorism . On the other hand, the US just invaded Afghanistan without any organized and constructive planning, therefore, after fighting 17 years long war, the international conflict of Afghanistan is still unresolved. Kamal, “the term ‘Grand Great Game’ can be reconstructed under the evolving political scenario and US continuous and unjustifiable presence in Afghanistan against the uncertain threat of terrorism , moreover, rising Chinese status and refortification of the Russian role in Central Asia. The US-India nexus is another emerging bloc in Afghanistan that reaffirms the changing geopolitical dynamics and security patterns in post-9/11” . Maley’s argument seems wrong when he explains that “for escalating international conflict situations and crises, assuming that the intervening power works with a clear political objective and plans well, the faster an intervention is deployed, the greater its chances of success. Paradoxically, crises often have to attain a certain level of severity before enough political support in the intervening state can be mustered for active involvement. Appropriate contingency planning is essential if an intervention is to occur expeditiously” . Conclusion Afghanistan problem has been contextualized and comprehended in the great game politics to understand the story of unintended consequences of historical events related to foreign interventions in Afghanistan from the Soviet invasion to the 9/11 incident. As in inference, it is concluded an idea that the foreign intervention in Afghanistan has shrunk the scope of the international politics into a regional power struggle which remains a case of serious consequences. While analyzing the foreign interventions in Afghanistan, started back in 1979 with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the later situation that the policy makers of 1980s were expecting after the Soviet withdrawal were also not much worrisome; for, they thought the Soviet withdrawal would stabilize Afghanistan and the region. However, the situation created in the aftermath of post-Soviet boots was terrible, since it observed multiple unintended consequences of the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan. It did not only empower groups like the Taliban to emerge but also catalyzed the use of Opium and Heroin in the world. Transformation of mujahedeen into the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were the perverse unintended consequences of the US rational foreign policy actions. Moreover, the 9/11 incident is considered a yardstick in changing geopolitical scenario and security patterns not only in international arena but also in the canvas of Afghanistan. However, in this scenario, changes in geopolitical dynamics and security patterns altered the nature and scope of the great game into the 3G. As unseen consequences of the 3G, foreign intervention of the sole superpower in Afghanistan has shrunk the scope of the international politics into a regional power struggle which is deemed a case of serious consequences to the international and regional security and stability along with terrorism. The US de-hyphenated the South Asian key player, i.e. Pakistan and India. This policy of the sole superpower in the post 9/11 era adversely affected the relationship between the two neighbors and heralded the penetration of regional-based great game geopolitics in the South Asia. As Buzan proclaims this point as “a variety of regional ‘great games’ is being played out by rival external powers in Central Asia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa…But South Asian politics is different in sense that this game is being played put in Afghanistan, located at its periphery (Buzan and Wæver, 2003: 15). The political commentators agreed on this point that the proxy warfare between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan is a zero-sum game, since D’Souza expressed that India’s growing aid diplomacy in the strategic backyard of Pakistan proven to be fatal between zero-sum rival. She further explained that the westerns dubbed this rivalry as the ‘new great game’, the source of insecurity and anarchy in the region that assures the renewal of ‘Great Game’ geopolitics that once played out there and in some ways or other still continue (D’Souza, 2011: 6). But this study has drawn out three basic findings: the 9/11 incident was a perverse consequence of the US Cold War policies which paved the way for the 3G, wherein the regional and non-regional players are involved in complex strategic engagement under a new international structure unimultipolarity with sub-regional great games and competitions along with cooperation for universal threat of terrorism; India-Pakistan rivalry in Afghanistan is a traditional chess game in Afghanistan international conflict with regional taste; and Pakistan-India proxy war in Afghanistan is a backfire of the Grand Great Game which is accepted by most of the research participants."

But stopping conflict in the Sea of Azov wasn't the only thing the two leaders discussed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Moscow to release 24 Ukrainian sailors during a call with her Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a press briefing. ""The conversation focused on the situation in the Kerch Strait,"" Seibert said late Monday. Late last month, Russian warships captured three Ukrainian naval vessels as they crossed through the strategic passageway. Russian authorities detained the Ukrainian soldiers on board, citing military provocations. Merkel told Putin that measures needed to be taken to ensure ""smooth passage"" through the strait after passage was blocked off, cutting off Ukrainian port cities on the Sea of Azov, such as Mariupol. The German chancellor had previously urged Russia and Ukraine to deescalate the situation, saying there is ""no military solution"" to the conflict between both countries. Strategic relations Merkel also discussed Russian gas transit via Ukraine ""after 2019."" Kyiv has voiced concern that a German-Russian pipeline known as Nord Stream 2 would become an economic and security risk. Last month, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal told DW she is concerned about Germany's continued involvement in building the pipeline, which is set to become operational next year. When asked whether Ukrainian opposition to the German-Russian pipeline was about business or security, Zerkal said: ""For us, it's about security, and it's definitely not about the revenues. It's about the guarantee of our security and the pipeline we have is a kind of guarantee for us."" She said lost revenues would likely amount to the cost of maintaining Ukraine's armed forces. But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said earlier this month that Germany would not moderate its commitment to the pipeline, saying Berlin has received assurances from the Kremlin concerning Russian gas transiting to Europe via Ukraine. Disinformation in the run-up In the run-up to the clash in the Kerch Strait, Moscow had launched a disinformation campaign about Ukraine and NATO's intentions for the Sea of Azov, a senior EU official said on Monday. ""If any of you thought that that incident, as it were, came out of the blue, you would be wrong,"" EU security commissioner Julian King told a conference hosted by German Marshall Fund think tank. ""The disinformation campaign began much earlier, more than a year ago, when Russian media started pushing claims that the authorities in Kiev were dredging the seabed in the Sea of Azov in preparation for a NATO fleet to take up residence.""

2a9938f7-c107-4f95-bb8e-39a033ba4c64,"Nov 16 - Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has welcomed the adoption by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly of a draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. The measure requires Russia to provide international human rights monitoring mechanisms' access to the peninsula. ""Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry welcomes approval of the updated and strengthened resolution 'Situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine' by the Third Committee of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly on November 15, 2018. This is an important contribution to the continuation of international pressure on Russia in connection with illegal occupation and attempted annexation of the Crimea,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The Foreign Ministry says the international community continues to strictly adhere to the policy of not recognizing the attempt to annex Crimea and condemns all attempts by Russia to legitimize it, including through the illegal holding of Russian elections in the peninsula. The draft document is based on the resolutions of the General Assembly of previous years on human rights in the occupied Crimea, as well as on a thematic report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""Russia has not complied with any of the provisions of these resolutions, and the situation with human rights on the peninsula continues to deteriorate,"" the statement said. ""We demand that the Russian Federation immediately cease gross violations of human rights and ensure unhindered international human rights mechanisms' access, including the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, on the territory of the temporarily occupied peninsula,"" the Foreign Ministry said. As earlier reported, the draft resolution adopted on November 15 by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly said since 2014 the Russian authorities have used torture to obtain false confessions in politically motivated processes. It emphasizes the need for the immediate release of Ukrainian citizens who were illegally detained and convicted, as well as those who were transferred or deported across internationally recognized borders from Crimea to Russia. Separately, the document recalled the cases of Ukrainian film director Oleh Sentsov, activist Volodymyr Balukh and Crimean Tatar Emir-Huseyn Kuku. The resolution calls on all international organizations and specialized agencies of the UN system, when mentioning Crimea in their official documents, messages and publications, to use the wording ""the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation,"" and ""encourages all states and other international organizations to do the same."" The document calls on the Russian Federation to create and maintain a secure environment for journalists and media workers, human rights defenders and defense lawyers, stop the practice of forcing Crimean residents to serve in the armed or auxiliary forces of Russia, and stop the practice of deporting Ukrainian citizens from Crimea for refusing Russian citizenship and discrimination against residents of Crimea. In addition, the committee calls on Russia to fully and immediately implement the decision of the International Court of Justice of April 19, 2017 on interim measures in the case concerning the application of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination . Russia must take all necessary measures to immediately put an end to the violations and abuses of human rights against the residents of Crimea, as well as respect the laws in force in Ukraine and repeal the laws introduced in Crimea by the Russian Federation and allowing for the forced eviction and confiscation of private property in Crimea in violation of applicable international law. According to the resolution, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly also condemns the illegal establishment of laws by the Russian Federation, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Crimea and demands that Russia abide by obligations under international law regarding respect for the laws in force in Crimea before the occupation. In addition, the UNGA calls on Russia to immediately rescind the decision to declare the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people an extremist organization along with a ban on its activities, as well as urges to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages. The Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in its draft resolution urges Russia to ensure adequate and unhindered access of international human rights monitoring missions and human rights non-governmental organizations to Crimea, including all places where people may be deprived of their liberty, recognizing that the international presence in Crimea is of paramount importance to prevent further deterioration of the situation."
962617e5-fb80-4cd4-aa1c-1f0169683176,"NATO has called on Russia to shed light on a new missile system that the US and other allies claim violates the accord. President Trump has vowed to pull out of the 1987 treaty over alleged noncompliance by Russia. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday urged Russia to make quick changes to comply in full with the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Stoltenberg called on Russia to provide details about a new missile system the United States and other allies claim violates the accord. The NATO chief voiced his dissatisfaction that Moscow had not responded to the Alliance's concerns over its SSC-8 missile program . ""NATO has urged Russia repeatedly to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way, and to actively engage in a constructive dialogue with the United States,"" Stoltenberg said at talks between Russian and NATO envoys in Brussels. ""We regret that Russia has not heeded our calls"" for transparency about the missile system, he said. Stoltenberg added that Russia's reluctance to discuss the missile system reinforces NATO's belief that it ""poses a serious risk to the strategic stability of the Euro-Atlantic area."" Russia denies that the missile system violates the INF treaty, which prohibits the US and Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying ground-launched nuclear cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers . President Donald Trump vowed last month to withdraw from INF, accusing Russia of ""violating the terms of the treaty."" The Kremlin responded, saying Russia would be forced to respond in kind if the US began developing new missiles. Renewed tensions The NATO and Russian envoys also discussed their respective large-scale military exercises. The two sides had an ""open exchange"" of views on Ukraine, Russia's Vostok military exercises and NATO's ongoing Trident Juncture drills, as well as on Afghanistan and hybrid security threats, a NATO statement said. The talks took place against the backdrop of renewed tensions between the West and Russia mainly over Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its involvement in eastern Ukraine. In October, NATO launched its largest exercises since the Cold War in Norway. Russia's 2018 edition of Vostok mobilized 300,000 troops and included joint exercises with the Chinese army - the biggest such drills since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.

aa17f2bb-d8e8-4fc1-a0fe-6c31f1ca3a3b,"MOSCOW -- The U.S. is serious about pulling out of a landmark nuclear agreement with Russia, but further discussions are planned before formal notice of the decision would be given to Moscow, national-security adviser John Bolton told The Wall Street Journal. President Trump announced the prospective exit from the agreement during a rally in Nevada on Saturday. He reiterated his stance at the White House on Monday, saying the U.S. would build up its nuclear arsenal, if necessary, aiming unusually tough language at Russia. ""We'll build it up until they come to their senses,"" Mr. Trump said. ""When they do, then we'll all be smart and we'll all stop and, by the way, not only stop reduce, which I would love to do."" Asked if he meant to deliver a threat to Russia, Mr. Trump said: ""It's a threat to whoever you want,"" adding, ""It includes China, and it includes Russia and whoever wants to play that game. You can't play that game on me."" Mr. Bolton, a longtime critic of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, said he had ""an extensive discussion about what the president said"" with his Russian security-council counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, on Monday. ""I think if you look at the president's statement in Nevada on Saturday, it's very strong, very clear, very direct as to what the United states is going to do,"" Mr. Bolton said on Monday. But, he said, the administration was ""going to be doing a lot of consultation with allies in Europe and Asia certainly we're going to have more discussions with Russia."" The U.S. has accused Russia of contravening the treaty, which bans the use of intermediate- and shorter-range rockets, as well as testing, producing or fielding new ground-based missiles. Russia is developing a missile system, but says it is in full compliance with the pact. Washington hasn't given formal notice to Moscow of its intention to leave the treaty, the rules of which require the withdrawing party to give six months' notice. Mr. Bolton said the required warning would be given ""in due course."" Credit: By Ann M."
40a0bfb8-9a8d-4005-b137-04d8eeca5ee4,"ABSTRACT The present paper looks into the current policies of Russia in the Balkans. It argues that after a short period of withdrawal from the region, Moscow is currently making efforts to regain its position and, in some sense, it has been a quite successful come-back. Russia has enhanced its economic presence, political clout, and symbolic influence in some of the countries of the region. However, Russia's present return to the Balkans is of a quite different nature than its past engagement there as Moscow has now moved to a more assertive foreign policy. The paper also looks at the response of the Balkans countries to Moscow's policies. It argues that the Balkans countries have adopted a more pragmatic approach to relations with Russia and as a result, Russia and these countries are in the process of finding a new, workable modus operandi for their interaction. Introduction1 This paper sets out to analyze Russia's position in the Balkans. The departure points for the paper are several problematic factors. Firstly, it has often been argued that Russia's identity as a great power shapes its assertive foreign policyWhile this might be true in Russia's relations with West, this type of account discards all the cases of collaborative Russian-Western interaction. Secondly, most analyses of Russian foreign policy tend to discard geographic variance in Russian foreign policy. One of the most obvious examples could be the striking contrast between Russia's active opposition to perceived Western expansion in the Black Sea region, as opposed to its indifference to Chinese penetration into Central AsiaDriven on this problematique, the paper will seek to explore the meaning of the Balkan region for Russia's identity. Thirdly, Russian foreign policy is often analyzed by scholars working on Russian foreign policy in various regions; less attention has been paid to the response of these countries to Russian policies. Such a narrow perspective often misses the important input that the countries of the region provide to shaping the outcome of regional politics. To address this, the paper proceeds as follows. First, it will explore the ideational background of Russian foreign policy and Russian perceptions of the Balkans. I will draw on these findings to understand how certain perceptions constituted possible and thinkable policy options. Additionally, I will seek to identify how Moscow's policies in the region have been shaped by the Russian-Western relations. Secondly, it will analyze Russian foreign policy in the region as it evolved from the 1990s to 2000s. In particular, it will look into the evolution of Russia's attitude toward the region in the context of Russian-Western relations. Thirdly, it will look at the response of the countries of the region to Russian foreign policy, and how this response has shaped the regional constellation in the Balkans. In particular, the paper will consider the political and economic dimensions of this interaction. Russia and the Balkans: Historical Imaginarles Many writings have focused on Russia's great power identity to highlight that the Balkans are important for Russia. This definition, while partially true, often implies that Russia pursues policies aiming to support ""fraternal"" Slavonic or Orthodox nations in their fight against external oppressors The equation between Russia's great power identity and its special relations with the Balkan nations has rarely been properly analyzedIndeed, one can agree that the Balkans have played an important role in the formation of Russia's identity. In analyses of Russian literature, textbooks, and official documents, the Balkans are most often mentioned as the place through which Russia became a state and a European great power. The Balkans are repeatedly constructed as the place where Russia borrowed all of the sacral features of its stately-existence . No other part of Russia's vast territory or periphery -not even the Baltics or the huge spaces of Siberia and the Pacificare mentioned as frequently or given such importance as the Balkans At the same time, Russia's great power identity does not necessarily mean that Russian policymakers feel strong moral obligations toward the Balkan nations . Indeed, Moscow entered into situational alliances with the Balkan insurgents when it needed their support in its expansion to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. However, such situational alliances did not necessarily mean any special emotional or spiritual bond between Russia and the Balkans nations. As recently acknowledged by a Russian scholar, even Catherine the Great's Greek plan, which has often been construed as Russia's commitment to create an independent Greece, in reality turned into a small-scale military operation under Count Orloff, aimed merely at setting up a naval presence in the region and not waging a major liberation war for GreeceLater on, Russia was prepared to undermine or act against some of these nations when they became too strong, as was the case in Russian-Bulgarian relations in the late 19th-early 20th century. A similar approach was obvious in Stalin's attempt to subordinate Yugoslav leadership after WWII, which resulted in to the Soviet-Yugoslav rift in the early Cold War period. Therefore, one could argue that in the Russian Imperial period or early Soviet era, Moscow relied on the support of the Balkan nations in its pursuit of its policies without necessarily attaching sacred sentiments to this relationship. As a broader generalization, Russia's relationship with the Balkans was rather a function of the primary goals of Russian foreign policy -imperial expansion and great power politics in Europe. When Russia reappeared on the international scene as a new, independent actor in the early 1990s, its policies in the region were shaped by its relationship with Europe. Unlike previous periods, Moscow was less interested in imperial expansion . What Russia was more concerned about in the early 1990s was to remain among the major European great powers, i.e. to be accepted into the club of great powers. While Moscow could not rely on its material capabilities in pursuit of such a status, it could still sustain such claims by contributing or participating in the great power concerts that decided the fates of the Balkan nationsIndeed, Russia still used historical narratives to maintain its place in the great power deliberations about the Balkans. This modus operandi was openly voiced by senior Russian politicians and diplomats in the Balkans. President Yeltsin argued that Russia should build its policy on the basis of Russia's great power relations with the WestDuring the war in Bosnia, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, made it explicitly clear that Moscow valued its cooperation with the West more highly than the map of BosniaIn 1995, Russia supported the Dayton Agreement despite the fierce protests of Bosnian Serbs. This policy continued after the much-criticized liberal period of Russian foreign policy . Under the 'statist' foreign minister Evgheniy Primakov, Russia supported and even actively took part in the military operations which effectively squeezed the most popular and radical leaders such as Radovan Karadzic from the Bosnian leadership and deprived them of media resources in 1996-1998During the NATO intervention in Kosovo, Russia did not seriously consider providing military support to Yugoslavia. Apart from symbolic actions such as the U-turn of the plane by Prime Minister Primakov and some intelligence sharing, Moscow's primary rationale was to maintain its role among the great powers and return the situation to the negotiating table, where Russia would be one of major mediators. Even the 'epic march' of the Russian peace-keeping battalion from Bosnia to the Kosovo airport sought more to secure Russia's presence in the region than to challenge the Western military operation. While NATO intervention in Kosovo is often mentioned as one of the turning points in Russia-Western relations, such interpretations could not explain why President Putin decided to support the U.S. operation in Afghanistan and help Washington gain basing rights in Central Asia. Moreover, after and despite the Kosovo crisis, President Putin raised the issue of a potential Russia application to NATO in 2002. Similarly, under President Putin, Russia was prepared to accept an independent status for Kosovo -if the West had properly worked with Moscow and allowed sufficient time to prepare the local public opinion. However, the information was leaked from the negotiation room and became public, forcing Moscow to disavow such a possibilityThese decisions suggest that Russia is more concerned about being recognized and included in the great power concerts than about negotiating arrangements for the failing states in the Balkans. The sections below suggest that Russia's policy in the Balkans is an outcome of this quest for recognition by the West -recognition that the West has often refused to grant. It reveals the limit where Russia would stop from seeking engagement with the West. Claiming Great Power Status The fact that Russia's policies in the Balkans are often defined and envisaged through the prism of Russia-Western relations becomes obvious upon a cursory look at the Russian foreign policy doctrine of 2016. While the document is full of references to the West, the U.S., Europe, and Asia, the Western Balkans are never mentionedThis, according to Russian researchers, reflects the state of interests and opinions about the regionAt the same time, one cannot but notice that Russias indifference to the region is not an unconditional one. As long as the region remains at the margin of the attention of Western powers, Russia's interest in the Balkans is also limited. However, when the West engages in certain actions in or toward the region, Moscow seeks to become 'part of the game,' ideally on equal terms or as a veto player. When the West fails to fully include Russia into their 'great power' decision making or action-taking, Russia adopts disruptive actions against the Western policies in the region. While some leading experts often argue that Russia has pursued the policies of a spoiler against the EU and NATO,15 such a description is partially helpful, as it raises a series of further questions. Why a policy of spoiling? If Russia has been disenchanted about the West, why not create an alliance with the countries of the region against the West as political realism suggests. What are the goals, the nature, and the limits of its policies of spoiling? Given that according to many experts the West remains the central object on the Russian cognitive horizon, this paper suggests that Russia's policies in the region are a function of Russia's pursuit of recognitionTherefore, one could argue that Russia pursues disruptive policies in the Balkans to socialize Europe into recognizing Moscow as an equal and competent actor in creating security architecture and an international arrangement in Europe This politics of socialization can explain why Moscow still refrains from escalating the conflict and adopting balancing or Realpolitik-style responses. It rather seeks to socialize the West into recognizing Russia as an equal partner. It creates or manipulates instability to demonstrate that Western policies adopted without Russia are doomed to fail. But these measures fall short of being defensive Realpolitik. As one Russian analyst states, ""Russia is keen, however, to take advantage of the deep-rooted local problems to make the Western Balkans a thorn in the West's side, while posing as an influential world power.In particular, Moscow seeks to undermine the West's state-building efforts in the Balkans. Within this logic, Russia has blocked any substantive progress in resolving the Kosovo issue by supporting the intransigent position of Serbia, and has blocked the process of recognizing the independence of Kosovo. It has also supported the radical positions among the Serb leadership and local communities in the North. Furthermore, the Kremlin-affiliated oligarch Konstantin Malofeev has arranged moral and financial support for the autonomy-minded leader of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milorad Dodik Additionally, while the NATO enlargement to the Balkans did not constitute a direct threat to Russia, Moscow still sought opportunities to destabilize the situation to prevent the West from feeling confident on the ground. These tactics targeted even the well-established and Russian-friendly countries of the regionFor example, when the government of Montenegro decided to start the process of integration into NATO, a Russia-led network of military intelligence organized a coup attempt in Montenegro. After the coup failed, the Kremlin was forced to send high-flying security official Nikolay Patrushev, Head of the National Security Council, for a 'damage-control' mission. It shows that, even while losing the symbolic battle over Montenegro's NATO membership, Moscow sought to maintain some sort of political influence in the Balkans. A similar approach informed Russia's response to the rapprochement between Athens and Skopje, as they finally moved to resolve the dispute over the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia after a more than 25year deadlock. Thanks to the Prespa Agreement reached by the Prime Minister of FYROM Zoran Zaev and his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras, the country received a new name -Republic of North Macedonia- and an invitation to start talks about entering NATO. Russia was not opposed to the agreement between Athens and Skopje per se, but it was frustrated that the deal was done without Moscow's consent, and that it was linked to NATO's further expansion in the Balkans. It tried to depict Western efforts in the region as 19th century great power geopolitics. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov personally floated a conspiracy theory about a potential partition of North Macedonia being discussed by Albania and Bulgaria Since the Prespa Agreement opened the door for North Macedonia's accession to NATO and highlighted Russia's exclusion, Moscow again sought to destabilize Greek-Macedonian relations. Ivan Savvidis, a Russia-affiliated tycoon, instigated and financed serious protests against the deal. Russia-born tobacco-producer Ivan Savvidis had repatriated to Greece and since the early 2000s expanded his economic presence in the Northern Greece. His economic activities had a peculiar character as they were designed to enhance his political influence. Savvidis bought and invested in the local football club PAOK and in local mediaHis investment in cultural and infrastructure projects brought him influence in the highly militant and mobilized Pontian Greek community and some radical nationalist groups. In June, various actors reported that Savvidis had instigated and sponsored mass protests against the Prespa Agreement on both sides of the Greek-Macedonian border. Importantly, to organize protests in Skopje, Savvidis drew on the fan-base of the local football club 'Vardar' owned by another Russian businessman Sergei Samsonenko. Samsonenko, who unlike Savvidis had a very low profile in the Russian business world, suddenly moved to Macedonia in 2006 and quickly evolved into a major business/social player. He bought two sport clubs, and invested in constructing sport arenas and hotels in Skopje's city center. Serving as Honorary Consul of Russia, Samsonenko worked closely with the local pro-Russian part of the leading political party bloc VMRO and had numerous meetings with VMRO Prime Minister GrujevskiAhead of the elections, Samsonenko openly supported VMRO and even participated in their electoral campaignMoreover, he criticized pro-Western Premier Zoran Zaev Ultimately, the Greek government opened an investigation against Savvidis and the businessman had to fleeThe Prespa Agreement was pushed through even though other members of the Russian-speaking community in Northern Greece sought to torpedo the deal by holding numerous rallies against it in Athens and Thessaloniki. When it became clear that the agreement, reached without Russia, would pave the way to North Macedonia's membership in NATO, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov accused the West of interfering in the internal affairs of the Balkan nationsHowever, when it became clear that it was impossible to revert the deal, the Russian minister made a U-turn to preserve Russia's image, claiming that Moscow has never been against a Greek-Macedonian compromise and only opposed any externally imposed policiesThe 'Macedonia' dispute reveals the mixed nature of Russia's policies in the region, i.e. to seek the West's acceptance of Russia's position, disrupt as much as it can to regain recognition, and if this policy fails to bandwagon with the West, but to seek opportunities to undermine the West's primacy in its projects in the Balkans. Several conclusions can be drawn from the above. Firstly, Russia's policies in the Balkans feature a targeted and very selective engagement with the region. Moscow clearly seeks to increase its presence there. Russian- and Kremlin-affiliated businessmen have made significant investments in specific politically-influential spheres . While formally driven by private initiatives, this presence tends to be turned into a tool of Russian policy or even used to destabilize the region and/or to undermine Western policies. Secondly, Russia's policy in the Balkans reveals a new emerging feature of decision making in the Kremlin that could be described as 'outsourcing' and 'multi-actor.' Even though President Putin clearly controls the Russian state and security apparatus, some analysts note that -in a departure from Soviet foreign policy- he currently balances between various groups of influence. He also allows competition between them and allocates certain resources for ad hoc, bottom-up foreign policy initiatives. Among these groups one can identify major structures such as political police and intelligence and military intelligence . But the circle of policy entrepreneurs is not limited to official state bodies. It also includes various non-state actors, i.e. business people , ideological groups , or even individual senior policymakers such as Putin's long-standing advisor on Eurasian affairs Sergei Glazyev. These actors often come up with various foreign policy initiatives and request -and sometimes gain- Kremlin support. This decision making process constitutes a fundamental change in Putin's foreign policy. This type of initiative helps the Russian leader manage elite groups and maintain plausible deniability in case of failures . On the other hand, this approach often lacks a certain coherence and professionalism and undermines Russia's image of strong and omnipotent security-state. Moscow is increasingly seen as a strong but unpredictable and incoherent actor. Even most Russophile governments in the Balkans have come to the realization that dependence and reliance on such a partner should be limited and clearly-bounded. Limits of Greatness: Russia's Policies, Western Counter-Measures, and Local Response The case of Bosnia is probably the classic example of Russia's effort to generate instability in the region. While in the early days of post-war reconciliation Russia played some constructive role in reconstructing the war-torn country and quickly bringing energy supply to Bosnian towns and cities, in the past decade the Kremlin has sought to prevent deeper integration within the country. From the early 2000s, the Russian energy company Gazprom, which took over the major enterprises in the Republika Srpska , has prevented the integration of the energy systems of the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska, the two entities created by the Dayton Peace AccordRussia had repeatedly supported Milorad Dodik, leader of the Republika Srpska , who was planning to run a referendum on the independence of RS. Dodik received the support of the Russian President as well as the financial backing of Kremlin-affiliated businessmen and Russia-sponsored official and social media. Moscow provided trainings for Dodik's personal paramilitary force, the 'Serbian Honor' hosting them both in Russia and in the 'Russian-Serb Humanitarian Centre' in Nis. To facilitate the further disintegration of Bosnia, Russia also supported Croatian separatism within the second major constitutive part of the country, the Bosniak-Croat Confederation. One of the radical leaders of the Croatian community in Bosniaand co-president of the Bosnian collective Presidency Dragan Čović received generous financial and political support from RussiaWhen Čović spoke about the Croatian Community leaving the Federation to create its own state, the Russian Ambassador to BiH immediately labelled it a 'Croatian question,' which has become a reality to live with However, despite Russian support of radical ethno-nationalist discourse, there are clear limits to the use of this instrument. The fact that Russia relies on non-transparent and often dubious channels of funding has made many of its allies in the Balkans vulnerable to sanctions and public scandals. After the EU came up with a negative response to the potential scenario of a referendum and the U.S. imposed sanctions against Dodik, the Bosian Serb leader quickly softened his rhetoric about independenceAfter a similar financial scandal linked him to Russian investors, the Bosnian Croat leader Čović lost the elections to the more moderate leader of the Democratic Front Zeljiko Komsic, who ran on more inclusive slogans of civic nationalism in BosniaDevelopments in Bosnia and the response of the Euro-Atlantic community shows that pro-Russian leaders in the region should possess a very high degree of integrity and reputation, and not fall under Western pressure in pursuit of their own nationalist agenda. But even in such a case, most ethno-nationalist forces cannot but see that potential scenarios of radicalization might eventually increase personal risks to their popularity or power. Therefore, they seem to look for a mix between ethno-nationalist rhetoric and practical policy, which would prevent them from being trapped in a radicalization spiral. In other words, Russia's allies in the Balkans would be happy to use Russian money and separatist slogans to build popularity, but are not prepared to burn their own political capital and lose control over their own countries as a result of Russia's great power ambitions. The case of Serbia displays a clear difference between the rhetorical and factual power balance in the region. On the one hand, President Vučić speaks highly of the Russian leader and explicitly excludes mention of any future membership in NATO. Moreover, the two leaders highlight the long-standing spiritual and cultural bonds between the two states. The Serb Orthodox Church clearly took Russia's side in its dispute with the Ecumenical Patriarch about the autocephaly of the Ukrainian ChurchRussian and Serb officials have regularly exchanged gifts and decorated each other for support and services of friendshipOn the other hand, despite numerous statements about the unique Eastern Christian cultural unity and shared negative attitude towards NATO, the current Serb leadership has pursued quite a different policy. For example, Serbia has an extensive interaction with NATO. It has signed a special Individual Partnership Action Plan with NATO, which it has implemented along with a number of other initiativesIn 2017 alone, Serbia participated in 18 joint exercises with NATO and U.S. troops. Moreover, Serbia signed a Status of Forces Agreement that offered NATO troops diplomatic status and immunity as well as access to Serbian military facilitiesAt the same time, Belgrade was reluctant to allow Moscow to turn its comparatively small presence under the aegis of an Emergency Ministry in South Serbia into a bigger militarized facility. Additionally, even in the less controversial question of Serbian membership in the EU, President Vučić highlighted that the Russian leader would respect Serbia's path to Europe When it comes to less politically visible issues, it becomes even clearer that the current Serbian government has serious concerns about Russia's hybrid activities in the country. For example, Serbia initially allowed Russia to organize a summer camp at the Serb resort of Zlatibor for the patriotic upbringing of Russian-Serb youngstersEven though the Serb co-organizer Željko Vukelić tried to position the camp as youth-patriotic work, the Russian co-organizer of the camp was the retired Soviet army colonel Valeriy Shambarov, famous for his imperial views; Shambarov stated that the goal of the activities was a military training for youngsters in SerbiaShambarov was affiliated with organizations that sent numerous volunteers to the war in the East of Ukraine. While the Serb government could not control the first camp organized in Russia in April 2018,41 Serb police demanded that the organizers stop their activities in SerbiaSimilarly, the leadership of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia, while praising Russia's sacrifice in WWII, sought to limit Russia's influence and the presence of Russian actors. For example, the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs banned the Kremlin-affiliated and very visible patriotic bikers gangs the Night Wolves from entering the RS. Instead, the RS created and funded a local replica of the 'patriotic bikers.'43 Similarly, the case of Greece has demonstrated the limit of Russian-Greek rapprochement. While the two countries enjoyed close relations even at the peak of the Cold War, the last two years have put these relations under pressure. While formally Greek Prime Minister Tsipras spoke highly about President Putin and the effective collaboration between the two countries, Greece still supported sanctions against Russia in the European Council. Greece felt it was being manipulated by Russia when it came to the promotion of energy corridors fully controlled by Moscow. Moreover, Athens was particularly annoyed with Russia's growing political presence and economic investment in one of the Holy Places -a complex of the oldest monastic communities of Eastern ChristianityMount Athos in Northern Greece. This frustration grew into an open diplomatic scandal, which involved two Russian diplomats and two other Russian officials associated with the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society . IOPS had been re-established by the Russian Parliament in 1992 and has fourteen offices in the Middle East and Europe, including Greece since 2016IOPS has been an active promoter of Russia's foreign policy since 2007, when Sergei Ste- pashin, former Prime Minister and the first Head of the Federal Security Service and Federal Counter-Intelligence, was appointed presidentStepashin sought to develop close contacts with local business- and community-leaders in Northern Macedonia, home to the populous and strong Russian-speaking community of Pontian Greek repatriates from post-Soviet space. In an unprecedently tough statement, the Greek Foreign Ministry accused Russia of long-standing animosity towards the Greek Church and subversive attempts ""to impose the presence of the 'Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society' in Greece, an organization created by the Czars' secret services in the 19th century with a view to de-Hellenize the patriarchates of the Middle East.While this harsh statement has often been interpreted as the personal whim of the highly emotional and controversial Greek Foreign Minister Kotzias,47 Greece eventually started to impose limitations on the travel of Russian officials and clergy to Northern Greece and access to Mt. Athos was limited. Moreover, Russian and philo-Russian monasteries in Athos were brought under investigation for financial mattersDespite the traditional anti-Americanism of the country, the Greek government offered the U.S. three new sites for basing rights: Volos, Alexandroupolis, and Larissa. Additionally, the Greek government agreed to host a NATO training center in the south of the countryAll these moves suggest that Russia's policy of return to the Balkans is seriously mitigated by the policies of the Balkan nations which -while reaping the benefits of collaborationstill consider the West to be more attractive in terms of political and security affiliation. The Economic Dimension In the economic domain, Russia has tried to offer the Balkans opportunities to partake in its own economic project. In the 1990s and even in the early 2000s, Moscow seemed to have accepted that -in the economic domain- the EU had the attractive power and transformative capacity to modernize and to bring prosperity to the region. However, some failures of the European state-building policies in the region, and Russia's growing prosperity driven by state-centered economic policies and backed up by the increase in energy prices prompted Russian liberal thinkers50 as well as some EU member states to question Europe's power of attraction as well as the EU's economic policies in the BalkansConsequently, Russia reconsidered its attitude toward Europe's 'transformation through integration' approach. This reconsideration led Russia to activate its Balkan policies in the economic dimension. Russia sought to highlight the high economic and social costs of European integration for the Balkans and offer an alternative option: deeper trade arrangements with Russia and, potentially, integration with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union. For example, Moscow touted alternative economic models and tried to appeal to those parts of the population that were disenfranchised by the neo-liberal economic policies promoted by Europe. Highlighting all of the risks and costs of European integration and offering an alternative to it is the cornerstone of Russia's attitude to the EU activities in the Balkans today. Instead of accepting a role as the European periphery, Russia offered to fight together for a decent place in the global value chain. One of the most visible instruments of Russia's economic policies is the energy domain. Over the past two decades, Russia has approached the countries of the Balkans, inviting them to support Russia-driven pipeline projects and to become hubs of energy flows to Europe. One of the most recent offers proposed by Russia was the idea of a South Stream pipeline project bringing Russian and Central Asian gas to the European markets. Promoted by the Russian-Italian energy alliance since 2007, South Stream was planned to run from Southern Russia under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and then break into branches running through i) Greece-Italy and ii) Serbia--Hungary-Austria. The idea had merit, given the fact that transit through Ukraine had been compromised by recurrent crises between Russia and Ukraine, but the project stumbled due to emerging European opposition to energy monopolies in the European markets. Articulated as the 'Third Energy Package,' this consensus prohibits energy producers from maintaining major control over transport and downstream capacities. This requirement went against Gazprom's traditional policy -to maintain majority ownership in its pipeline projects. In 2014, the European Commission initiated an infringement procedure against Bulgaria for non-compliance with the Third Energy Package. It should be noted, however, that one of the reasons the EU adopted a tough line against the South Stream was Russia's invasion of UkraineAfter Bulgaria decided against the project, Russia announced its withdrawal from South Stream53 and launched an alternative, TurkStream. With Turkey, Greece, and Serbia openly joining TurkStream, Russia's power of economic attraction seems to be growing. At the same time, this victory reveals the limits of Russia's economic attractiveness. It looks as if the countries of the region, while accepting Russia's offer, are still trying to do so while remaining in the framework of European economic governance. Even Serbia's decision to join the project was accompanied by Belgrade submitting a formal request to the Secretariat of the European Energy Community in ViennaIn the case of Greece and Hungary, TurkStream still relies on the existing energy infrastructure, which actually undermines Russia's plans to back up this energy trade with physical infrastructure, i.e. Russian-owned pipelines. Indeed, Russia's energy offer in the Balkans is not always a welcome development. Firstly, it is associated with the risk of escalating conflict with Europe, which the countries of the region seek to avoid. Secondly, Russia's assertive policy in taking over the oil/gas processing capacities of the countries of the region pushed even the closest Russia's ally -Serbia- to adopt tough measures against Russian energy-giantsThirdly, Russia's inclination to link political and economic questions seriously limits the attractiveness of its energy card. One of the most recent examples was Russia's attempts to force Serbia to grant special diplomatic privilege to the site and the workers of the Russian Emergency Ministry in Serbia. When President Vučić refused Russia special treatment, Moscow revoked its promise to grant Serbia a new discount on gas price. While countries struggled not to 'spoil' their relationship with Russia, Belgrade started to look at Russia's energy offers as both an opportunity and a challenge. Another limiting factor is the fact that Russia's frequent efforts to link energy to political issues has prompted the EU and U.S. to come up with what one can call an 'alternative to the alternative.' While some EU member-states believe that Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream will make Europe less dependent on the Russian-Ukrainian transit, they still seek to create alternatives to Russian supply. Moreover, the U.S. simply exerts pressure on its allies, asking them not to engage with Russia. Both the EU and U.S. are heavily investing in the creation of LNG terminals both in the Balkans and the BalticsThe EU has used its power to ensure that all Russia-built pipelines would provide access to third-party gas for transit to Europe, thus neutralizing Russia's potential efforts to use a monopoly over gas pipelines for political purposes. Unsurprisingly, Balkan elites share this concern, given that Russian officials tend to treat the Balkans as an underdeveloped periphery. The Russian state still has significant investment opportunities inside Russia and looks to expand its economic collaboration with the leading European countries. As a result, Russia cannot deploy significant financial and human resources to promote collaboration with the Balkans. This became even clearer after the 2008 financial crisis which undermined Russian economic presence in MontenegroFor example, when Russia worked with Germany to promote the Nord Stream pipeline, it deployed its most skillful lawyers and high-flying officials who patiently worked with German elites to prepare the ground for the deal. On the other hand, in the Balkans, Russia sent far less important and refined cadres to present Russian energy offers, which have failed to build sufficient support for Russia. As a result, energy cooperation is seen rather as a marriage of convenience than a shared success story, and economic interaction with Russia is treated as secondary to interaction with the EU Similar dynamics characterize the overall trade dynamics between the countries of the region and Russia. Although Moscow speaks about increasing trade with the countries of the region, in reality, trade is in comparative decline. The volume of trade with Russia is decreasing while Europe is becoming a major trading partner, even in the case of Serbia, Russia's closest regional partner. Moreover, with Serbia progressing on its European integration path, Moscow seems to be prepared to suffer negative consequencesIt seems that the Balkan countries now consider Russia an interesting -but relatively small market. At the same time, the renewed EU membership promise and offer to the Western Balkans to become a major hub for connectivity between Europe and Asia looks like a gateway to the global economy The annexation of Crimea and Russia's role in the Ukrainian crisis have resulted in a further deterioration of economic relations between Russia and the Balkan nations. Albania and Montenegro have clearly aligned with the West against Russia by adopting sanctions against Russia and suffering Russian counter-sanctions. Similarly, the Greek Socialists and Macedonian Social Democrats, traditional Russian allies, have drifted away from their erstwhile Russophile feelings. Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, the two most Western Balkan nations, Slovenia and Croatia, along with Bulgaria, while supporting sanctions, still insist on resuming dialogue with Russia. Two close Russian partners -Serbia and Bosnia- refused to support sanctions against Russia in 2014-2015. But even with this decision, President Vučić tried to keep a middle ground. On the one hand, Vučić refused to join sanctions against Russia, referring to close Russia-Serbs relationsOn the other hand, Vučić highlighted that Serbia would stick to existing contracts and will not try to boost its exports to Russia to satisfy the growing demand in agricultural products in Russia In 2014-2016, it was comparatively easy for Serbia and Bosnia to maintain a middle ground between Russia and Europe. At that point, the EU was still undecided about membership prospects for the Balkan states. Therefore, both the West and Russia viewed the region with lesser interest. Interaction in the triangle of Russia-Balkans-West was shaped by a series of occasional mutually-beneficial deals and a general discourse of friendship and peace. The situation changed in February 2018 when the EU adopted the Communication for Western Balkans, which provided the countries of the region with a membership prospect and clear date of 2025The balance of indifference has been disrupted, and the countries of the region will have to face the growing tension between compliance with EU norms in foreign and internal politics and the threat of potential Russia's countermeasures. This may lead to further deterioration of the situation in the region and inside some of the countries of the region. Conclusions Despite its high visibility, Russia's recent return to the Balkans reveals serious limitations for Russian policy, and tensions between Moscow and the Balkan capitals. The primary underlying factor, which has a limited possibility of a genuine Russian-Balkan alliance, is the fact that historically Moscow has placed a higher value on participation in the great power concerts than friendship with the countries of the region. Within this logic, Moscow has been and remains prepared to prioritize its relations with the West over the interests of its allies in the Balkans. Moreover, it is often prepared to use its influence in the region to generate instability in order to 'socialize the West' into accepting Russia's primary role in the region. Despite the growing symbolic presence of Russia, the nations of the region -fully aware of and disappointed in its policieshave now adopted a more skeptical attitude toward Russia. The fact that Russia values its great power status more than its friendship with Montenegro or Greece has resulted in these countries' further drift to the EU and NATO, respectively. The second important factor limiting Russia's influence in the Balkans is the nature of the tools that it uses. Moscow seems to rely on the people and instruments that it uses in forging alliances and loyalty in its internal politics, i.e. corruption, an informal network of violent groups, and compromising materialsThis method, however, is not similarly effective in international politics. Countries of the region clearly see the threat of Russia manipulating instability, and have drawn the line for Russia's penetration into these countries. Greece, North Macedonia, and even Moscow's closest allies had to draw a line in front of Russia's gradual penetration into the region. Serbia and Bosnia banned Russian paramilitary groups and pursued low-key collaboration with NATO. In Bosnia, pro-Russian candidates from the Serb and the Croat community lost elections; they were exposed for their pro-Russian attitudes and eventually lost their political positions. Additionally, reliance on dubious people and methods has made pro-Russian actors in the region vulnerable to corruption charges, sanctions, and public scandals. The West can effectively neutralize Russia's efforts, given its advanced access to the monitoring of financial flows from Russia to the region. In Bosnia, the ethno-nationalist leader of the Serb community Dodik had to abandon his projects after his dubious funding channels from Russia were revealed. North Macedonia opted for a reconciliation with Greece after it turned out that anti-Greek sentiment had been sponsored through Russian oligarchs on both sides of the border. The most successful of the countries of the region has been Serbia, which has managed to find an ideal mix of pro-Russian rhetoric and effective pro-Western policies. For similar reasons, Russia's economic presence could not lead to deeper ties and more positive influence in the Balkans. While it may achieve certain success in energy cooperation, the fact that Moscow tends to attach political is not to say that Russia will be squeezed out of the Balkan energy market. But it is clear that the countries of the region tend to increasingly rely on the European normative framework in energy deals with Russia, and engage in a growing pursuit of alternative energy supply from Europe and elsewhere. In this context, Russia -even if its energy supply to the Balkans remains at the same level- will find it difficult to turn its energy collaboration with the region into political influence. Similarly, Russia's trade is hampered by serious structural constrains that limit Russia's success in the region. The Russian market remains small for the Western Balkans; trade turn-over between Russia and the region constitutes only a fraction of their general trade. The EU's promise of membership and the inclusion of the Western Balkans in the EU's strategy of connectivity have made Russia even less relevant for the countries of the region. Moreover, the fact that many countries of the region agreed to support EU sanctions and suffer Russia's counter-sanctions has imposed further limits on their trade. Therefore, Russia-Balkans economic ties are not sufficiently dense to produce serious social and political effects. This trend suggests that Russian presence in the Balkans is a troubled comeback, and not fully conducive to regional stability. NATO's expansion to the Balkans will lock the region in the Euro-Atlantic security system and further undermine Russia's role in the region, potentially causing a serious identity crisis. This is why Russia's response is to prevent NATO expansion by creating further instability, which it is in a prime position to do. In the post-Soviet space, some of the Balkan societies have constituencies that would ""buy into"" Russia's narratives drawing on Soviet nostalgia, ethno-nationalist trauma or conservative slogans. The high social costs of certain reforms might make local societies more prone to divisive rhetoric articulated by Russian media outlets. Moreover, the Ukrainian crisis has once again reconstituted the link between the events in the Black Sea region and the Balkans, fusing the two regions -as argued by a prominent Russian scholar- into one security complex,65 which will remain vulnerable to shocks coming either from the adjacent regions or from the broader context of Russian-Western interaction. Sidebar When Russia reappeared on the international scene as a new, independent actor in the early 1990s, its policies in the region were shaped by its relationship with Europe. Unlike previous periods, Moscow was less interested in imperial expansion Russia is more concerned about being recognized and included in the great power concerts than about negotiating arrangements for the failing states in the Balkans Russia was not opposed to the agreement between Athens and Skopje per se, but it was frustrated that the deal was done without Moscow's consent, and that it was linked to NATO's further expansion in the Balkans Developments in Bosnia and the response of the EuroAtlantic community shows that pro-Russian leaders in the region should possess a very high degree of integrity and reputation, and not fall under Western pressure in pursuit of their own nationalist agenda When it comes to less politically visible issues, it becomes even clearer that the current Serbian government has serious concerns about Russia's hybrid activities in the country Some failures of the European state-building policies in the region, and Russia's growing prosperity driven by statecentered economic policies and backed up by the increase in energy prices prompted Russian liberal thinkers as well as some EU member states to question Europe's power of attraction as well as the EU's economic policies in the Balkans The EU has used its power to ensure that all Russia-built pipelines would provide access to third-party gas for transit to Europe, thus neutralizing Russia's potential efforts to use a monopoly over gas pipelines for political purposes The fact that Russia values its great power status more than its friendship with Montenegro or Greece has resulted in these countries' further drift to the EU and NATO, respectively NATO's expansion to the Balkans will lock the region in the Euro-Atlantic security system and further undermine Russia's role in the region, potentially causing a serious identity crisis"

Ukraine has not purchased Russian gas since November 2015. Instead it preferred reverse gas supplies from the EU. After the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk refused to recognize and obey the coup-installed Kiev government. Their citizens held referendums on self-determination, during which the majority of voters supported establishing the so-called people's republics of Donetsk and Lugansk . Clashes between the Kiev government and Donbass militias that started in April 2014 later evolved into full-scale warfare with the use of heavy armored vehicles and aircraft.

ad58f008-c0ee-49a9-b09e-7473f02a039a,"MOSCOW -- Russia's announcement over the weekend that it would suspend its obligations under a Cold War-era nuclear treaty essentially seals the fate of a pact the U.S. recently said it plans to abandon and heightens the risk of a new arms race. In what he termed a ""tit-for-tat response,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that his country would suspend its involvement in the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty and accused Washington of breaching the agreement. ""Our American partners have announced the suspension of their participation in the treaty, so we will suspend as well,"" Mr. Putin said in a televised meeting with his defense and foreign ministers. He also ordered the officials not to initiate any talks on disarmament. ""We will wait until our partners are ready to carry out an equal, substantial dialogue with us on this very important topic -- for us, for our partners, and for the whole world,"" Mr. Putin said. The Kremlin's decision was a terse pushback to Friday's announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the U.S. would withdraw from the treaty in six months if Moscow doesn't destroy missile systems that U.S. officials say are in breach of the pact. The U.S. has long accused Russia of violating the treaty, which was brokered in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and which bans U.S. and Russian land-based missiles with a range between 300 and 3,400 miles. The dispute dates to 2014, when the Obama administration first accused Russia of related transgressions, and it escalated in 2016. The treaty's all but assured demise marks the latest setback to already-strained U.S.-Russia relations and would seriously undermine the nuclear arms control architecture established when Washington and Moscow were increasing their stockpiles of the world's most dangerous weaponry. Russia has claimed the breakdown of the INF treaty is part of a long-term U.S. strategy to amass nuclear weapons and gain dominance in this sphere as part of a refashioned new world order. Following Mr. Putin's response, a State Department spokesman reiterated the U.S. position. ""Russia is undermining European security with its INF-violating missile that was developed specifically to destroy key European military and economic targets and coerce NATO governments,"" the spokesman said. Russia has denied that its 9M729 missile system violates the treaty. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in November that a missile flew its maximum distance -- within the boundaries of the treaty -- in a test during Russian military exercises along the country's border with North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states in September 2017. Western officials said recently that Russia had expanded its deployment of the 9M729missile system. China, which U.S. officials have said has grown more aligned with Russia, has also weighed in, voicing opposition to the U.S.'s planned withdrawal and urging Washington to resolve its differences with Moscow through dialogue. ""As an important bilateral treaty in arms control and disarmament, the treaty is of great significance for smoothing relationships between major powers, promoting international and regional peace, and safeguarding global strategic balance and stability,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Saturday, according to government news agency Xinhua. During the Saturday meeting, Mr. Putin said Russia would follow the U.S. in pursuing research and development of intermediate-range missiles, which he said it wouldn't deploy in Europe or elsewhere unless the U.S. did so.The development of new weapons shouldn't pull Russia into an expensive arms race, he said. The rhetoric was somewhat tempered compared with a warning from Mr. Putin in December, when he said that if the deal collapsed, the targets of subsequent military exchanges would be U.S. missile sites hosted by allies within striking distance of Russia rather than on American soil. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had offered the U.S. ""unprecedented measures of transparency"" as part of the agreement, but received unacceptable ultimatums. --- Bojan Pancevski and Michael R.

In recent years, Washington has repeatedly alleged Russia was in breach of the agreement. Moscow emphatically dismissed these accusations and countered them with its own claims over the United States' non-compliance.

Speaking during a visit to Moscow on January 18, Maas called on Moscow to destroy a type of missile that Washington alleges violates the treaty. U.S. President Donald Trump last year announced that the United States will pull out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty because of Russian violations. Reacting to Maas's remarks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied Russia had violated the INF treaty. In comments quoted by Russia media, Lavrov said U.S. officials had informed Moscow that their decision was final and not open to negotiation. Washington has said it will exit the treaty in early February if Moscow does not end its violations. Russia denies the missile in question -- referred to as the 9M729 -- violates the INF treaty. Maas also said the INF treaty was necessary but not sufficient given the emergence of new technologies since the treaty was originally signed. Maas highlighted cyberwarfare as an example of such new technologies. The INF bans ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. Nearly 2,700 missiles were eliminated by the Soviet Union and the United States -- most of the latter in Europe -- under the treaty. Russia has warned that if the United States abandons the pact and deploys such missiles in Europe, Moscow will respond in kind. Based reporting by Reuters, AP, Interfax, and TASS Copyright 2011.

""We are forced to again urge our partners to abandon overt ""double standards"" and pay attention to the real problems and threats"" against ""European security and stability,"" it added.

ca0f8e68-bf2f-46db-a198-444cc1c937e4,"In recent years Russian-American relations have seen a significant deterioration. However, the resulting confrontation is not as great in either scope or the level of intensity that existed during the Cold War. Although contradictions between Russia and the United States are significant, they are not antagonistic. The opposition on global issues is on the whole manageable, but could intensify if the system of treaties and arms control continues to erode, particularly due to the growing competition in cyberspace. Regional conflicts have an even greater negative impact on Russia-US relations, although almost all of them are on the periphery of world politics. An improvement in Russian-American relations is hardly possible in the immediate future, yet a sharp return to the Cold War level is also unlikely. The continuation of a 'Cool War' - limited confrontation - seems the most likely scenario. Keywords: Cool War, Cold War, Russia, USA, global problems, regional conflicts Rusko-ameriški odnosi so se v zadnjih letih zelo poslabšali. Vendar pa posledična soočanja med državama niso ne tako obsežna ne tako intenzivna kot so bila med hladno vojno. Čeprav so nasprotja med Rusijo in Združenimi državami Amerike precejšnja, niso antagonistična. Nasprotna stališča glede globalnih vprašanj so v splošnem obvladljiva, vendar pa bi se lahko zaostrila ob nadaljnji eroziji sistema sporazumov o oboroževanju in njegovem nadzoru, zlasti spričo naraščajoče oboroževalne tekme v kiberprostoru. Še večji negativni vpliv na odnose med Rusijo in ZDA imajo regionalni konflikti, čeprav se skoraj vsi dogajajo na periferiji svetovne politike. Čeprav je malo verjetno, da bo v bližnji prihodnosti prišlo do izboljšanja rusko-ameriških odnosov, je prav tako malo verjetno, da bo prišlo do ostrega prehoda na raven odnosov hladne vojne. Najverjetnejši scenarij se zdi nadaljevanje ohlajenih odnosov , to je, omejene konfrontacije. Ključni pojmi: ohlajeni odnosi , hladna vojna , Rusija, ZDA, globalna vprašanja, regionalni konflikti Introduction During the two decades since the Soviet Union collapsed, the relationship between Russia and the United States has experienced ups and downs, and elements of partnership and rivalry have both been present. Yet, negative trends have gradually intensified. The events in Ukraine and Syria simultaneously became a reflection of the deteriorating relations and a powerful catalyst of the process. In essence, the two countries have engaged in confrontation, but it has been of a different nature than in the Cold War. Although the overall ambience of Russian-American relations is in some aspects worse than during the Cold War, certain elements of partnership, including in the sphere of security, remain. In view of this, 'Cool War' seems to be a more accurate way of describing the current situation. Nevertheless, Russia and the United States have crossed a certain line. The main features of this new stage in their relations so far look quite fuzzy; basically, there is a process of erosion of the international treaties and institutions developed in recent decades. Still, the process has gone so far that it is now unlikely to be stopped - the point of no return has already been passed. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the ongoing changes in Russian-American relations and the prospects for their development. The war is cool, not yet cold Russian-American relations have entered a new stage where their circumstances and development will be determined by the following factors: First, while socio-political systems in the United States and Russia are largely different, they are not as antagonistic as they once were during the Cold War. Both systems acknowledge the legitimacy of a market economy and private property. Among the high political echelons in Russia, they are certain the authoritarian model of capitalism best suits Russia. Naturally, the USA would prefer Russia to have a different political system. The Americans believe their model of social and political development is the best ever known but, as pointed out in the National Security Strategy , ""we are not going to impose our values on others"". It would be reductionist to explicate the contradictions between Russia and the USA by simply pointing out the differences in their socio-political systems. The Russian and American evaluations of the relative positions of their countries globally differ significantly and often clash . Yet, the extremes of the Cold War are entirely preventable. Even in the event of an arms race, a repeat of the 1962 Cuban crisis or the emergence of a similar complication seems highly unlikely. Whereas during the Cold War ideology was an important factor shaping foreign policy, it now only plays a supporting role, mostly to wrap up already made decisions within propaganda packages. The two sides must operate within a single world economic system - unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is not trying to create a special 'world socialist economic system'. Exchanges in the fields of science, culture, education as well as person-to-person contacts remain at a uniquely high level compared to the Cold War period. Nothing remotely reminiscent of the Iron Curtain can be seen nowadays. Therefore, all the prerequisites are in place to prevent the current confrontation from deteriorating and to keep it at the level of a 'Cool War'. Second, it is their mutual suspiciousness that remains widespread in the higher echelons of society. As Angela Stent rightfully contends, in both the USA and in Russia, the policies towards each other, even at the best of times, have exhibited duality - in the business community and in those oriented to peaceful development the line of thinking has predominantly focused on co-operation, whereas the approach in those connected to national security has been one of suspicion . In the aftermath of the events in Ukraine of 2014, the Russian military's influence has increased dramatically. Many Russian politicians are inclined to interpret any developments at home or abroad as being driven with the help of the 'underhand practices' of the USA. Likewise, following the 2016 presidential election, the majority of the American establishment became convinced Russia had been 'meddling' in US home affairs, and began to hold extremely negative opinions about anything to do with Russia. It should be added that, unlike the Barak Obama Administration, the Donald Trump Administration appears to be under a much stronger influence of the military and the military-industrial complex. The current Administration, it seems, possesses a negative view of Russia, the likes of which have not been seen since the Soviet Union's collapse, although Trump himself has stayed clear of hostile rhetoric. Currently, the 'Russian problem' has become a powerful instrument in the domestic political struggle in the USA. Donald Trump's numerous opponents are using it to maximally weaken his position. Any American politician who would dare seek a way to improve relations with Russia encounters huge extra challenges. The same can be said about Russia - anyone now daring to call for improved relations with the USA risks ending up outside of mainstream Russian politics. A sign of the mutual suspiciousness is the extreme nervousness among the political class of both countries about any steps taken by their counterparts. The third factor is that the political class in both countries is inclined to make fewer concessions now than during the Cold War, which limits the seeking of compromise. Even those few in the USA who advocate the need to improve relations with Russia expect Moscow to make the first move. Meanwhile, most policymakers in Russia espouse a view that one should not give ground first because that would be interpreted in the USA as a sign of weakness. Putin rejected the suggestion of his close friend and adviser Alexei Kudrin to change foreign policy due to economic troubles . A solution each side would be able to present as evidence of its own success has yet to be discovered. Fourth, much will depend on the effectiveness of the western sanctions. The dominant opinion in the USA is that Russia is in a stage of a long-standing decline and sanctions should help to speed up that process. The American sanctions imposed following the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan proved a powerful blow to the Soviet Union. Remarkably, in December 1981, KGB Chairman Yury Andropov categorically spoke out against an intervention in Poland, arguing the prospect of Solidarnost coming to power would be a lesser evil than any possible tightening of American sanctions . Still, Russia, unlike the Soviet Union, is a country with a market economy, giving it greater room for manoeuvre. Initially, the gravity of sanctions was underestimated by the Russian political class. As Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev once put it, ""all these stupid sanctions shall pass"" . In a similar vein, state media outlets adopted the reasoning that it was not the sanctions but the talking about them that one should fear most. Today, it is quite clear the American sanctions are to stay in place for ""very long"" . Nowadays, members of the Russian ruling class are well aware of the great gap in the economic potential of Russia and the USA and its allies. Nevertheless, the overall tone is that the economy has adapted to the new unfavourable conditions and that it is capable of withstanding the sanctions for a very long time. This discrepancy in readings of the future reduces the chances that either side will be willing to make concessions. The fifth factor is that, at present, a normally functioning mechanism for negotiations between Russia and the USA appears to be absent. In July 2018, Helsinki hosted the first post-2010 negotiations between the presidents of Russia and the USA . However, they did not bring about any noticeable shifts. So far, there is no clarity on how well dialogue at the highest level will develop. Contacts between the Russian Foreign Minister and the US State Secretary are happening more often, but even they do not take place regularly. It is noteworthy that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's name appears on the 'Kremlin List' - a roster of high-ranking Russian politicians, officials and businessmen, which serves as a kind of warning about the potential imposition of personal sanctions. Such channels are usually kept open - the US sanctions list does not include, for example, the names of the foreign ministers of North Korea, Belarus or Venezuela. Meetings of politicians and diplomats are also incidental rather than part of regular consultations. As a result, the countries' mutual diplomatic activity has been severely limited. Professional contacts between the military and the intelligence services occur once in a while. During the August 2018 meeting in Geneva, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and US National Security Assistant John Bolton agreed to make such contacts more regular. There is still no information on how well that agreement is being implemented. Yet, bilateral committees and working groups have virtually halted their activities. Negotiations are mostly focused on problems at hand rather than the potential for developing relations. Finally, and most importantly, the actions of both sides vis- -vis each other are becoming much less predictable. The probability of unexpected moves and turns is very high. Some politicians in Russia suggest that unpredictability or the willingness to play against the rules once seen as universally accepted is a powerful feature of Russian foreign policy . This view is not universally shared. It seems that unpredictability is often the result of the two parties being unable - sometimes due to their mutual suspiciousness - to always correctly evaluate, nor calculate the moves and intentions of the other side. In addition, there is a much greater number of actors around the globe than there used to be during the era of bipolarity, and so they may all be playing their own games. As demonstrated in the Syrian conflict, among these actors some, instead of an improvement, would rather seek a complication of Russian-American relations for the sake of achieving their own narrow objectives. Thus, although Russia's relations with the USA are not central to the modern world, much depends on them. The existing contradictions are serious enough, but not antagonistic. Their future pattern will in many respects be determined by subjective factors such as certain concrete steps on the part of the ruling classes in the respective countries. Right now, it is quite difficult to predict what those will be, but it will not be a confrontation of the highest intensity - a Cool War most likely. This will no doubt be reflected in the ways for seeking solutions to both global problems and regional conflicts. Global problems through the lens of russian-american relations The Russian-American Cool War undoubtedly has an impact on many global problems and finding solutions to them. The first in line is the current world order. It is broadly hoped among the higher strata of power in Russia that it will be somehow possible to reach with the USA a 'big deal', a sort of 'Yalta2'. In that case, Russia would have the right to a 'second key' on par with the USA for most global and regional problems that it sees as being within the zone of its vital interests. Such views are widely held not only by the bureaucracy and military, whose members used to lament over their country's loss of status as being one of the two world superpowers, but also by business leaders, much of whose business has proven uncompetitive in international markets without direct state backing. The chances for a 'Yalta-2' have always been slim because the 21st century is not an era of geopolitics but of geoeconomics. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act declaring Russia an adversary reduces those chances to near-zero - in 1945 in Yalta the talks went on between the allies with the anti-Hitler coalition, not adversaries. Others in the Russian political class would prefer to see a softer version, namely, a re-enactment of the 'Concert of Great Powers' at the Vienna Congress of 1815 where Russia enjoyed a major role. The chances for this scenario are also very slim - despite their differences, none of the participants of the Concert viewed the others as rivals or adversaries. Most likely, Russia will continue the line of opposition to the USA, steering towards the creation of a multipolar world, and focus on developing co-operation with China so that the Russia-China duo could develop to become a counterweight to the USA. Another challenging global problem of the 21st century is the terrorist threat. Russia and the USA in fact have co-operated in this area, e.g. in the autumn of 2001, when they were both part of the anti-terrorist coalition. Sometimes, it is even argued that a joint struggle against terrorism could prove to be exactly the lever needed to push their relations in a positive direction of development. Unfortunately, this is also hardly possible - US public papers place Russia among adversaries together with terrorism. That, just like the introduction of restrictive measures against Russia's intelligence services, is very telling. The USA wholeheartedly supported the British position on the ""Skripal case"" and imposed a range of sanctions against Russia . Most likely, the USA and Russia will co-operate on fighting very specific terrorists. For example, in December 2017, Vladimir Putin thanked Donald Trump for the CIA information that helped prevent a terrorist attack on the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg . Yet, Russian and US intelligence services, while working together in very specific instances - something that, it should be pointed out, was never the case during the Cold War, still view each other as rivals. Accordingly, their combined struggle against terrorism on all fronts is hardly possible. Of course, the arms race lay at the heart of the Cold War. Still, in the 1970s and 1980s the two superpowers signed a series of arms control treaties and took initial steps towards disarmament. However, the mechanisms created at the time have lately shown cracks that keep on growing. At present, in Russia and the USA, the appetite for boosting military capabilities has taken over. Many in Russia believe the treaties signed during the 1980s and 1990s gave greater advantages to the USA and thus, in their opinion, it would be wise to repudiate them. Namely, Russia's current foreign policy attaches much less importance to those treaties than did the Soviet Union policy during the years of the Cold War. Recently, particularly after the 2014 crisis in Ukraine, Russia has been implementing large arms programmes. Almost half of his Annual Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly that Putin delivered on 1 March 2018 was dedicated to issues of strengthening the armed forces and creating new types of weapons . While Obama advocated the gradual elimination of nuclear weapons and called for a ""nuclear zero"", the position taken by Trump is completely the opposite. Strengthening US military might is a logical continuation of his motto ""America First!"". The principle ""preserve peace through strength"" proclaimed by Ronald Reagan in 1983 has resurfaced in the US public documents once again under Trump . In his State of the Union Address of 2018, Trump called for the end of all sequestering of the military budget and emphasised the role of nuclear weapons in strengthening the power of the USA. The release of the Nuclear Posture Review, which includes the possibility of using atomic weapons in local conflicts, has sent ripples across Russia. The Russian leaders have laid blame directly on the USA for making preparations for such a conflict with Russia in Europe . Russia's Military Doctrine allows for the possibility to use atomic weapons exclusively in response to a nuclear attack on Russia and its allies or in an event of an aggression with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the Russian State is at stake. This approach was reconfirmed by Putin on 1 March 2018 . Moreover, as President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained, it was in reference to the CSTO member states, not Syria, whose treaty with Russia contains no provision for an allied obligation . At times though, more radical positions - to place nuclear weapons in Syria - are voiced. Today, it is hard to imagine a situation where Russia or the USA would risk a local nuclear conflict with each other although, unfortunately, one must not write off the possibility of a return to a policy of brinkmanship in regional conflicts, especially in Syria. In 2002, the USA officially pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Moscow had considered one of the pillars of the international security system. In Russia, as Putin stated, the move was viewed within the context of the USA being capable to deliver ""the first disarming, disabling strike, even against nuclear power"" . Earlier US assurances that its ABMD was intended to keep Iran and North Korea at bay had never been taken seriously in Moscow. Of late, Russia has focused on developing weapons capable of eluding US antimissile systems . Most likely, no agreement on ABMD systems will be reached in the near future. In 2010, Russia and the USA signed the Treaty for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. Yet, in his first telephone conversation with Putin, Trump announced that it was a ""bad treaty"" . Still, on 5 February 2018, Russia and the USA announced the fulfilment of their treaty obligations. At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry queried some of the data provided by the USA . Currently, the USA seeks to prolong the treaty for another 5 years after it expires in 2021 . Russia is also leaning in the same direction. Neither party is really interested in engaging in a strategic arms race. However, internal politics in either country could seriously challenge both the prolongation and signing of a new treaty. Unfortunately, the chances of saving the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , once a symbol of ending the Cold War, are relatively small. An earlier version of the Russian Foreign Policy Concept had proposed to make the treaty globally binding since a few other countries had come to possess this class of missiles (Koncepciya vneshnej politiķi..., 2008). In 2013, Putin cautiously questioned the rationale behind the treaty . To further complicate the matter, the USA has been accused of violating the treaty in so far as the elements of the ABMD developed by it in Romania could also be used to launch intermediate-range missiles . The USA, in turn, accuses Russia of violating it and developing missiles of this class . In the autumn of 2017, the US Congress authorised funding for a study on the possibility of deploying such missiles . In the meantime, the Administration announced sanctions against several Russian enterprises that, in America's judgement, were in violation of the treaty . There is a high chance the 1987 Treaty will cease to be effective, if not de jure, then de facto. In that case, the deployment of Russian and US intermediate-range missiles in both Europe and North-East Asia is quite likely. In 2010, Russia announced its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe since most other countries had never ratified it. In the ensuing years, Russia significantly increased its military activity in the European part of the country. Following the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis , NATO deployed several battalions in Poland and the Baltic states, where there had been none previously. Situations involving tension with Russian and NATO military aircraft arise regularly in the skies over the Baltic Sea. Nevertheless, the concentration of troops and armaments near the demarcation lines between Russia and NATO is incommensurable with those numbers in Central Europe during the Cold War. Yet, the situation remains complicated in view of the weakening of the monitoring and trust-building mechanisms. According to experts from the Munich Conference on Security, the likelihood of a conflict in Europe due to some accident or error has increased significantly . Russia and the USA are taking ever more diverging approaches regarding the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Washington mostly stands for preservation of the status quo and against the emergence of any new nuclear states. In Russia, the range of opinions is wider - some politicians and experts believe that new emerging nuclear powers would weaken Russia's position in the world since the latter's nuclear arsenal is the only attribute of a superpower it possesses; others think the emergence of new nuclear powers would be a problem mostly for the USA, whereas for Russia they present no danger. Lately, the latter view has been gaining in influence. They consider the situation surrounding the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran primarily through the lens of confrontation with the USA. In both instances, the situation has developed in a zig-zag fashion: In the Iranian case - from seeking compromises under Obama, to confrontation under Trump, whereas for North Korea the opposite is the case. Yet, even in the best of circumstances, the non-proliferation regime is going to erode gradually. Cyberspace is becoming a major area of rivalry where fully-fledged information wars have been waged for several years now. There is a constant intertwining of facts and 'fake news', which cannot but affect various parts of the population. It is not without coincidence that the Oxford Dictionary announced 'post-truth' word of the year in 2016 , reflecting the extent to which it has become part of social life in many countries. Russia and the USA have repeatedly accused each other of using cyberspace for hostile purposes. Talks on the matter, although announced, are practically non-existent. The approaches taken by the parties are qualitatively different. Russia places the main emphasis on observing state sovereignty in the area of information, as well as on information security. The USA, while not denying the importance of information security, proceeds from the principles of prioritising human rights, including the right to obtain comprehensive information. Moreover, in the autumn of 2017 the first signs of countries flocking to blocs on issues of information security became traceable. Just prior to another BRICS summit, Russia called for co-operation among the BRICS countries in the area of global information, specifically to create universal rules for the responsible behaviour of the states in this area and the signing of an intergovernmental BRICS agreement on international information security . Meanwhile, a report prepared for the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations stated that ""the US government and NATO should lead the coalition of countries committed to mutual defense against cyberattacks, to include the establishment of rapid reaction team to defend allies under attack"". The report also called for the convening of a NATO summit so as to develop a common approach to interpreting Article 5 of the North Atlantic Pact on cyberattacks . NATO General Secretary Stoltenberg also described the possibility of the implication of Article 5 in the case of a cyberattack, but not automatically . Thus, to a certain degree one may expect an intensification of confrontation in cyberspace, while in the medium term the emergence of blocs of countries that will share a common policy on cyberspace. Up until recently, co-operation in the field of space exploration had progressed quite well. Neither sanctions nor restrictions have been imposed there. Today, however, the situation is changing. The Trump Administration released a statement that it has no plans to extend the agreement on the International Space Station after 2024 and that the USA will carry out a space programme of its own . Yet it is most alarming that a serious arms race could unfold in outer space. This creates fertile ground for the emergence of new serious threats and the growth of mutual suspicion. Thus, although confrontation between Russia and the USA on global problems is significant, it is not dramatic. It is much less intense than it was during the Cold War, and currently there are no reasons for either its aggravation or mitigation. Still, the situation could become less predictable in case of the erosion of arms control treaties, which until now have been one of the cornerstones of strategic stability. There is a high probability of a new arms race, which would be more qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. But the greatest element of unpredictability lurks in cyberspace. The cool war and regional conflicts An important demonstration of the fact the Cold War had ended was that the USSR and the USA, joined by other countries, together sought ways to resolve numerous regional conflicts. That sort of mutual understanding generally survived into the post-Soviet period. The 2008 conflict was a turning point when, for the first time in two decades, the two powers came to support opposing sides in a conflict, with the USA backing Georgia and Russia standing behind South Ossetia and Abkhazia, both of which had proclaimed their independence. In the years that followed, the gaps in approaching matters were only becoming wider until around 2014-2015, when a confrontation between Russia and the USA recurred. It most vividly manifested itself in the post-Soviet space and in the Middle East. There is a strong conviction in the higher echelons of power in Russia that it is the post-Soviet states that shall comprise the ""region of Russia's privileged interests"" . It is exactly for this reason that Moscow has shown its displeasure over the rapprochement of Georgina, Moldova and Ukraine with the West. Washington has always been critical about Russia's attitude here . The standoff between the two integration projects - Eurasian and European - has been a major reason for the drastic aggravation of several old conflicts and emergence of new ones across the post-Soviet space . The most difficult one is the situation around Ukraine. Notwithstanding the Minsk Agreements, there has been neither a complete ceasefire, nor a withdrawal of heavy military equipment. In December 2017, Putin spoke for US involvement in a settlement in the Donbas region . However, the nature of RussianAmerican meetings is that of preliminary consultations. Russia and the West both agree that the UN should be part of the process. Yet, while Ukraine and the West propose a 'Kosovo' option with the UN administering and controlling the Ukrainian-Russian border, Russia insists on a 'Cyprus' variant with UN troops being present along the ceasefire line only and on the need to include Russian servicemen as part of the contingent . There is not even the slightest suggestion of common ground in sight on the issue of Crimea. Moscow believes the matter is not subject to discussion, whereas Washington insists it will never recognise Crimea as part of Russia. Different approaches are seen in the positions of Russia and the USA on the situation in the Caucuses. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and signed treaties with them, whereby their armed forces and police de facto became part of Russia's internal structure, while Russian military bases have appeared in their territories and it has also provided significant financial assistance to the republics. The USA fully supported Georgia, demanding that Russia withdraw its recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The resumption of hostility is hardly possible now, but political tensions remain. In Transnistria, the situation is more favourable. The likelihood of reopening hostilities is virtually non-existent, economic ties are constantly being developed and political dialogue is gradually being established with, inter alia, the participation of mediators and observers . Among the most contentious issues still on the agenda is the presence of the Russian contingent in Transnistria. The USA, the EU and Moldova are demanding its withdrawal, while Russia disagrees. Considerable effort will be required to bring about a complete settlement, but the overall situation invites a more optimistic view than most other cases. Another important region in which Russia and the USA are facing each other off is the Middle East. Russia's involvement in the conflict began with its assistance to the government of Bashar Assad, which is viewed within the context of being the frontline in the fight against the 'colour revolutions'. Since 2015, Russian troops have been directly involved in military operations against ISIS and other opponents of Assad. The construction of Russian military bases in Syria was a reflection of the desire not only to lend support to Assad, but to consolidate a permanent presence in the region. Negotiations with Egypt on permission for the Russian Air Force to use its airfields, with Sudan on using its military base on the Red Sea , and with Libyan Marshal Khalif Khaftar on the coordination of efforts with the troops in Eastern Libya are all testimony to Moscow's desire to expand its sphere of influence to the maximum. Washington has fought against ISIS too, yet Russia and the USA have failed to agree in earnest about the coordination of their efforts against a common enemy. It all boiled down to merely the coordination of measures to prevent accidental collisions. In February 2018, an armed clash occurred when supporters of Assad and a group of Russian mercenaries invaded the area of responsibility of the US-led coalition and were thoroughly defeated. Russia and the USA are trying in parallel to manage two separate peace processes, and in both instances with minimal success. The Russian pro-government press makes no secret of the fact that, after the defeat of ISIS, ""a new strategy will be aimed at squeezing out the star-striped invaders"" . Since the US and Russian presence in Syria is likely to persist, tensions between their military are inevitable. One should not underestimate the likelihood of them clashing either by accident or as a result of being provoked by other actors, including non-state ones. During the campaign in Syria, there has been a significant rapprochement between Russia and Iran, although their relations are still limited. Since the USA sees Iran as one of its bigger opponents, Moscow in many instances acts as its advocate. Russia's support for Iran is clearly a huge irritant between Moscow and Washington. At the same time, Russia is not supportive of Iran's claims for hegemony in the region and seeks to maintain good relations with other major actors, including Israel and Saudi Arabia which are at odds with Tehran, Turkey whose relations with NATO and the EU have seriously deteriorated, Egypt, etc. In every particular instance, Russia is pursuing its own objectives. For example, in negotiations with Riyadh, Moscow is focused on coordinating the policies that bear on oil prices . It is worth noting that Moscow is acting so as to distinguish its modus operandi from that of the USA with a view to contributing, if possible, to a reduction of America's influence. The situation in the Middle East relates closely to the developments in Afghanistan. Moscow is certainly fearful that destabilisation in Afghanistan could negatively impact on Central Asia. At the same time, Moscow is trying to initiate peace negotiations between the Kabul government and various opposition groups, including the Taliban, under its aegis. Somewhat less intense is the Russian-American confrontation in the Balkans. Russia's Foreign Policy Concept of 2016, unlike in 2013, makes no mention of the Balkans, but a certain interest in the region remains. This has to do with exporting gas , foreign investment by Russian companies and the presence of those Russians who own real estate there. It is important to Russia that several Balkan states are keeping dialogue open at the summit level and do not join in the sanctions . One of Russian policy's main aims here is to prevent the further enlargement of NATO and the EU to ensure that at least some of those countries preserve the status of neutrality. Particular attention is paid to Serbia and Republic Srpska. Russia's primary concern is not so much about their military potential skewing the balance of power between Russia and the West, as much as about not letting the Balkans become a kind of backstage for the US missile defence systems in Romania and the West in a broader sense, particularly in the event of escalation of the Ukrainian conflict. Further, in the long term one should not exclude the possibility of the intensification of Russian-American rivalry in the Arctic given that their interest in the region is growing steadily. Thus, Russia and the USA are lending support to opposing sides in a fairly large number of regional conflicts, and that figure is rising. The greatest potential threat is with the conflicts in Eastern Ukraine and Syria whose settlement is hardly possible in the near future. The way those conflicts are developing and the state of Russian-American relations are closely intertwined: On one hand, the course of events in Eastern Ukraine and Syria will be affecting the dynamics of those relations, while on the other - settlement of those conflicts will barely be possible without a positive shift in relations between Moscow and Washington. The situation is such that neither Russia nor the USA can unilaterally bring about the resolution of conflicts, but they both have sufficient capabilities to block their counterpart's efforts. However, unlike during the Cold War, it is unclear whether Russia and the USA, even if they were to act in concert, would be able to resolve regional conflicts, particularly in the Middle East. Nowadays, regional conflicts are causing more trouble in Russia-US relations than global problems. Yet, most of them, to be sure, are peripheral to world politics. What lies ahead: scenarios for the future One may expect three scenarios for the development of RussianAmerican relations in the medium term - an optimistic one where a return to the easing of tensions and a turn towards partnership occurs, and two pessimistic scenarios, namely, continuation of the 'Cool War', or worse - a new round of the Cold War. The first scenario, which would be a re-enactment of the turn between the USSR and the USA at the time of Gorbachev and Reagan, seems the least likely of the three. It was possible then because part of the higher Soviet echelons of power were acutely aware of the apparent failure of the Communist project, oriented themselves toward Western values, and no longer viewed the USA through adversarial lenses. They were convinced that the transition to privatisation and a market economy would benefit them significantly more than the mere managing of state property, while also wishing for their country to break out of the isolation of a besieged fortress that it had been, so as to become part of the global community. An overwhelming majority of Soviet people also trusted the superiority of the Western societal model. The USA's influence, its 'soft power' over the Soviet people was incredibly potent. Today, the situation in Russia is absolutely different. The upper echelons are convinced about the superiority of authoritarianism over democracy, and that Russia has strengthened its positions in the world arena. According to Sergey Karaganov, a political expert in Moscow, ""history has pushed Russia in the center of a new competitive struggle between the liberal-democratic and the authoritarian models of capitalism"" and it is exactly Russia that ""has managed to catch the wave of history, which is about to put an end to the five centuries of Western dominance, and is moving full steam ahead"" . In the eyes of those in power in Russia, the USA is an adversary that is aiming to dislodge them. Their possession of real estate, capital investments and personal relationships in the USA are an important, but not the only or main motive behind their thinking. The average citizen's sentiment is considerably less antiAmerican. The latest opinions polls even show a small rise in sympathy for the USA. Yet, overall, the influence of American 'soft power' on Russia today is not significant. Besides, the current policy of the Russian leadership, particularly on Crimea, has enjoyed such wide popular support that hardly any domestic political figure can ignore that. A very similar situation is observed in the USA - members of the establishment are single-minded about forcing Russia to cardinally change its policy. In the circumstances, the optimistic scenario for the development of Russian-American relations has a truly minuscule chance of being realised. Any future standoff between Russia and the USA will likely be about Russia's place in the world arena. The likelihood that the USA will agree on a ""Yalta-2"" with Russia is close to zero. Russia's parity with the USA in strategic nuclear capability does not help to redress its significant deficiencies in other areas, particularly in the economy, science, new technologies and innovations. This misbalance is unlikely to improve within the foreseeable future. Besides, in its confrontation with Russia, the USA enjoys the full support of almost all European countries and other allies around the globe. Not a single member state of the Eurasian Economic Union, the CSTO, SCO nor the BRICS has spoken up for Russia and against the USA. 'The Turn to the East' has allowed Russia to avoid complete isolation, but it has not been enough to compensate for the losses it has suffered in confrontation with the West. This feeling of frustration seen in the political class is reflected in the view that Russia ""is about to enter upon a period of geopolitical loneliness for a century "" . In the near term, the USA is highly likely to conduct a policy of containment against Russia. Initially levied in a spontaneously chaotic manner, the sanctions are being slowly structured into a system and are becoming tougher all the time. The Russians are less sensitive to economic hardships than their counterparts in Europe and the USA, but there is good reason to believe, as they do in Washington, that cutting Russia off from Western technologies and innovations should significantly weaken it over the long term. The danger of lagging behind the leading states in 20-30 years was also pointed out by Putin during his meeting with the academic community in St. Petersburg. Moscow has tried to resist the unfavourable balance of power although relations continue to worsen. This kind of logic is grounded on the assumption that, at some point, the USA will conclude that 'business as usual' corresponds to its national interests better than confrontation does. One cannot but recognise the fact that Russia's policy has been witnessing a shift in emphasis lately. Moscow is bent on hitting the USA at its weakest and most vulnerable pressure points. It does so even when it cannot derive any benefit or even if it must pay a disproportionally high price. Russia is suggesting to its partners that they use only national currencies in the hope of decreasing the role of the US dollar in international trade, but with little response. There is also a view among the Russian establishment that the USA and the EU are headed for a break-up and that the common western front underpinning sanctioning is going to disintegrate. These high hopes received yet another boost in light of the dissent by European countries regarding Donald Trump's decision to scrap the Iranian nuclear deal. Germany and several other European countries are also supporting the construction of ""North Stream-2"" despite American threats to impose sanctions on this project. Of the two remaining scenarios mentioned regarding the development of Russian-American relations, the most likely seems to be a continuation of the Cool War along with various divergences for either an improvement or worsening of relations, rather than a second round of the Cold War. Moreover, whereas during the Cold War both the USA and the USSR aimed to crush the enemy to achieve total victory, today they have set a much less ambitious goal - to force their adversary to change its policy. The downfall of Russia would imply the strengthening of China, which is scarcely part of the planning in Washington. When Donald Trump makes statements about the possible return of Russia to the ""Group of Seven"" and so on, he is of course primarily seeking to prevent the rapprochement between Russia and China . Besides, as insightfully noted by Samuel Charap , ""Russia lashes out at the United States and its allies"". On the other hand, a sense of fatigue is apparent in the general population. This leads one to conclude that neither mobilisation nor modernisation but inertia seems to be the most likely course of Russian action. That, in turn, implies the continuing of tensions within strictly defined parameters. One should not overlook the fact that the leaders of both countries, when faced with alternatives which may be the result of either international or domestic factors, tend not to resort to the toughest measures. The American researcher Eric Shiraev was absolutely right to call the 'Kremlin List' ""semi-sanctions"" . Therefore, the greatest number of acute confrontations should be expected to occur in the peripheral vectors of world politics, while both sides are likely to refrain from direct military action against each other. Unlike during the Cold War, neither of them is rejecting tactical co-operation when it suits their needs, including among the military and the intelligence. The biggest challenges and dangers lie in the fact that both sides are guided by some outdated notions of the past century, deeply mistrust each other, and have a smaller ability to manage situations that unfold in the course of confrontation, particularly in cyberspace. The latter offers exactly a fertile basis for surprises. Most significantly, there are quite a few governmental and non-governmental actors whose interest is to worsen Russian-American relations, and so provocations on their part are quite possible. In the medium term, the potential to develop along the lines of the Cool War scenario would be depleted and the parties would have to face an uneasy choice. The decision as to which direction those relations should be headed in will depend on a several factors such as the balance of power between Russia and the USA, the overall situation of the world stage, the course of internal politics and socio-economic processes in both countries, including the will of the political classes to normalise relations with each other. Conclusion In over 200 years of their relations, Russia and the USA have never fought each other. Moreover, during World War I and II, they fought together as allies. In the entire history of their relations, Russia and the USA have done much more good than bad to each other. Yet, their confrontation during the Cold War had a remarkable impact on both their elites and peoples. Already during the initial stage of confrontation, it was quite obvious to most farsighted analysts that ending the Cold War would not be easy. Thus, back in 1951, distinguished US diplomat and scholar George Kennan claimed that Russia, after the collapse of Communism, would not immediately become a nation with a socio-political system in place; instead, it would start on the path to evolution. His conviction was that the USA should exercise utmost caution . Looking back at the past three decades, one would have to admit that the USA and Russia have tried almost everything that Kennan cautioned against. One would also have to concede that the inertia of the Cold War, its lingering legacy, has proven more enduring than anyone could have imagined just a few years ago. The ongoing confrontation, although not as acute as during the Cold War, is less predictable, and will complicate international relations for many years to come. Still, putting an end to it will be neither quick nor easy."

""President Trump has made it clear to Russia that they must leave and renounce their support of the Maduro regime,"" the White House added.

""The Maduro regime continues to rely on Cuba's playbook of repression and torture to remain in power,"" according to the statement. In his telephone conversation on Wednesday with US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed out to the inadmissibility of American interference in interior affairs of Venezuela, where the opposition is attempting to seize the power. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Russia's Rossiya-24 television channel on Wednesday that the United States was using aggressive rhetoric against Venezuela with the aim to demoralize the citizens of this country. Protests erupted in Caracas and several other cities in Venezuela after a group of military servicemen sided with Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido. According to earlier reports, during the protests, which resulted in clashes with security forces, a few dozen people were injured in the capital of the country. Guaido posted a video on Twitter on Tuesday urging the Venezuelan military to take to the streets in order to ""end the usurpation"" in the country. A group of military officers and head of the Popular Will party Leopoldo Lopez appeared Guaido's video. National Assembly's deputy from the state of Miranda Manuela Bolivar stated on Wednesday night that at least 78 people were injured in clashes with law enforcers during anti-government protests in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and 89 more were arrested. Venezuelan Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino Lopez wrote on his Twitter account on Wednesday that at least eight law enforcers were wounded in clashes with protesters."

The statements are the latest in an ongoing diplomatic tussle over culpability for a war that followed a nonaggression pact between Hitler and Stalin and killed some 6 million Poles, in addition to tens of millions of Russians, Germans, and other Europeans. ""President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions, and he has always done it deliberately,"" Morawiecki said in a statement quoted by AP. ""It usually happens in a situation when the authorities in Moscow feel international pressure caused by its actions. And this pressure is not on the historical stage but on the modern geopolitical scene."" The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned Moscow's ambassador on December 27 after the latest instance of Putin accusing Poland of responsibility for the outbreak of World War II. Putin had criticized as ""sheer nonsense"" a European Parliamentary resolution saying the Soviet Union bore partial responsibility for World War II, alongside Germany. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union secretly agreed to carve up Poland into German and Soviet sections in a treaty of nonaggression known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939. Adolf Hitler ordered an attack on Poland days later. Morawiecki cited international pressure currently bearing down on Putin over Russian state-sponsored doping, his efforts to ""fully subordinate Belarus to Russia,"" and continuing sanctions over Russia's military invasion of Ukraine and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. ""I consider the words of President Putin as an attempt to conceal these problems,"" Morawiecki said. Based on reporting by AP Copyright 2011.

""President Trump also emphasized his support for effective global arms control that includes not only Russia, but also China,"" Deere said in a statement on Trump's Oval Office meeting with Lavrov. The problem of the Iranian nuclear dossier sharply deteriorated after Washington unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on May 8, 2018, and slapped economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports. US President Donald Trump repeatedly said that he was ready for dialogue with Tehran. He said that he was interested in replacing the existing JCPOA with another treaty which would include both Iran's nuclear program and a wide range of issues such as Tehran's missile program and its regional policy. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Tuesday that Washington and Moscow were determined to help Pyongyang make progress in achieving full denuclearization."
ebd60543-82f4-4598-84b5-5a995deb9c45,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are having a public disagreement over whether President Donald Trump warned Russia against interfering in U.S. elections during a private meeting. At a joint press conference Tuesday following a meeting at the State Department, Pompeo said he told Lavrov that Russian election interference is “unacceptable,” while Lavrov called the well-documented evidence of Russian interference “baseless.” Later Tuesday afternoon, Trump and Pompeo met with Lavrov at the White House. According to the official White House readout of the meeting, “President Trump warned against any Russian attempts to interfere in United States elections and urged Russia to resolve the conflict with Ukraine.” But during his own press conference following the White House meeting, Lavrov gave an account that conflicted with the administration’s official story, claiing he was the one who raised the issue by way of complaint over Pompeo’s earlier remarks. The New York Times’ Edward Wong asked Lavrov “The White House just put out a statement about your meeting with President Trump saying that the president did warn about, warn you not to interfere in US elections and also urged you to try and settle your conflict in the situation with Ukraine. I was just wondering if you did discuss these two items, and if so can you tell us about the discussion?” “No, we did not discuss the election,” Lavrov said. Later in the same press conference, Bloomberg News’ Nick Wadhams told Lavrov that “The White House issued a readout that explicitly said President Trump warned you against any Russian interference in US elections,” and asked “Are you saying that that warning was not delivered?” “I did not read the White House’s comments about our meeting, we’ll issue our comments, you can read it,” Lavrov said, then added “State Secretary Pompeo mentioned this, that the U.S. warned Russia against interfering in the U.S. election process.” “I responded to that, and I told it to Donald Trump that state secretary mentioned this issue publicly, and I responded publicly again that we proposed to the current administration to publish the transcripts of our communication” with the Obama administration on issues of election security. He went on to claim that the Trump administration refuses to release those materials. On Wednesday morning, Pompeo held a briefing at the State Department, and was confronted with Lavrov’s remarks, about which both Pompeo and the reporter laughed aloud. Pompeo said discussions of Russian interference “happened in every meeting I was in.” “I will leave to the White House to give the details of what was said, I never talk about what the president says in those private settings,” Pompeo said. “But I can tell you that Foreign Minister Lavrov’s statement is not accurately a reflection of my recollection of that meeting.” “And there was no mistake that President Trump made clear in the meeting that he had with Foreign Minister Lavrov — and the rest of the Russian team that was there — that President Trump personally and America finds their meddling in our elections unacceptable in the very same way that I had said it earlier to Foreign Minister Lavrov,” Pompeo said. Unless a transcript or a recording of the meeting is released, Americans will have to decide whether to take the word of a propagandist, or the other guy. Watch the clip above, via Fox News.

4d6f07ce-7a23-40e4-a974-3e7d60401189,"Reporters Without Borders issued the following news: Reporters Without Borders is concerned to see the Russian government stepping up control of domestic reporting in connection with the coronavirus epidemic while, according to the European Union, conducting a disinformation campaign about it internationally. Russian journalists covering the coronavirus are being targeted by Roskomnadzor, the media control agency that RSF has included in its list of Digital Predators of Press Freedom. The regional online newspaper Magadan Govorit was forced to delete a story at the start of the week about the death of a patient suspected of having the virus who finally tested negative. The newspaper said its information was reliable and verified, and did not give the cause of death. Roskomnadzor nonetheless insisted on its deletion. Radio Echo Moskvy, Facebook and the Russian social network VKontakte were also forced to delete posts at the start of the week under the law on disinformation that took effect in March 2019. ""Russia's big censor, Roskomnadzor, must not increase its activities at a time of crisis, when unrestricted access to information is extremely necessary,"" said Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF's Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk. ""Information control initiatives are being stepped up on the pretext of combatting disinformation. The Russian authorities must not take advantage of this epidemic to restrict press freedom. We call for the repeal of the excessively vague 'fake news' law, which violates the freedom to inform."" At Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin's behest, a centre tasked with informing Russian citizens about the coronavirus epidemic, called ""StopCoronavirus.rf,"" was launched on 17 March. Although operated by the state, it has been attached to an NGO run by Alexey Goreslavsky, who used to work for the presidential administration overseeing Internet policy. Vladimir Tabak, the former deputy director of the Institute for Internet Development is to assist Goreslavsky. He says he will be responsible for ""information risks, fake news, and content production."" He and Goreslavsky previously distinguished themselves by helping to create RuNet, the Russian ""Sovereign Internet,"" which is supposed to protect Russia against digital threats in the event of conflict but provides also a new way to control online activities. Media access to information is meanwhile being restricted more and more. Since 17 March, reporters cannot attend an event at which Vladimir Putin is present unless their temperature has been taken at least three times. On 19 March, foreign reporters were denied access to the Russian parliament, while the courts began preventing the press from attending public hearings. Although the Moscow court authorities promised to provide written reports and video retransmission ""when possible,"" the measure was regarded as arbitrary and lacking in transparency. At the same time, the EU has accused Russia of conducting a disinformation campaign about the coronavirus epidemic in five languages with the aim of sapping trust in European institutions and spreading panic. More than 80 cases of disinformation have been registered since 22 January. One of the examples cited was Russia's amplification of Iranian claims that Covid-19 is a US biological weapon with the aim of inciting nationalist and anti-American sentiment in Europe. Russia is ranked 149th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2019 World Press Freedom Index."

b093185a-3101-4211-9221-b3f9453875fd,"The outbreak of pro-democracy protests in Tunisia in January 2011 developed into a wave of Arab popular uprisings that shook the Arab world, moving its way from the Maghreb to the Levant by March of the same year. The civilians of the town of Dara'a near the Jordanian border, took to the streets in protest against the torture inflicted by the Syrian regime on a number of local students who had been responsible for painting anti-government graffiti. The demands of the protesters evolved from the simple release of the students into broad, Syria-wide reforms, such as the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, introduction of multi-party democracy, instituting equal rights for the Kurds, and broader, more basic, human rights and political freedoms such as the freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly. By April the regime under al-Assad had reacted to these demands and formally repealed the 1963 emergency powers law that had granted the government sweeping powers to suspend constitutional rights. Yet, just as it seemed Syria would be yet another Arab state to give into the demands of demonstrators, the Syrian government launched a series of brutal crackdowns on protestsThese actions of the Syrian government led to unrest throughout the country culminated into a civil war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights2 by March 2018, seven years after the start of the conflict, documented the deaths of 353,900 people, of which 106,000 were civilians. The civil war had resulted in about 1million casualties of war with permanent disabilities, including within that number 86,000 who had lost limbs as a consequence of the conflict with a further 6million Syrians fleeing the violence and danger, becoming internally displaced, whereas another 5million had fled Syria for safety abroad to adjacent states and further afield to Europe and elsewhere. In just a matter of three months, from January to March 2019, an estimated 7,770 civilians were killed in Syria as a result of the ongoing conflictFor Europe, the Syrian conflict cannot be viewed or understood as events in a far-off Middle East. The geographic proximity of the Arab world to Europe has led it to be traditionally viewed as close to the ""backyard"" of Europe, separated by sea and deserts but still close to major European centres of population. It is because of this geographic proximity that Europe is consequently affected by what are ostensibly localised disturbances within the wider Middle East region. The Mediterranean may be Europe's ""backyard,"" and conflicts close to that ""backyard"" can result in more direct effects upon EuropeSyria signed a Cooperation Agreement, which governed its trading relationship with the European Union in 1977, beginning the formal relationship between the two. Syria would also become a part of the EU's Union for the Mediterranean, the Barcelona Process, the European Neighbourhood Policy and was in the process of completing the EU-Syria Association Agreement when the Syrian Civil War broke outEU's Political Stance on the Syrian Crisis On 22 March 2011, the EU foreign policy High Representative, in a statement expressed the EU's ‘profound concern' at the developing situation in Syria, and noted that the EU ‘strongly condemned the violent repression, including through the use of live ammunition, of peaceful protests'In a month's time and with no improvement in the behaviour of the Syrian regime, along with calls from the then US President Barack Obama, the EU also called for President al-Assad to ‘step aside,' HR Ashton stated in a press release: “The EU has repeatedly emphasized that the brutal repression must be stopped, detained protesters released, free access by international humanitarian and human rights organizations and media allowed, and a genuine and inclusive national dialogue launched. The Syrian leadership, however, has remained defiant to calls from the EU as well as the broad international community including Syria's own neighbours. This shows that the Syrian regime is unwilling to change. The President's promises of reform have lost all credibility as reforms cannot succeed under permanent repression. The EU notes the complete loss of Bashar al-Asad's legitimacy in the eyes of the Syrian people and the necessity for him to step aside.”7 The same stance was also reflected by other EU's institutions. The EU Parliament in September 2011 demanded an immediate halt to government crackdowns, for the Syrian regime and Assad to immediately relinquish power and for the establishment of a transparent investigation into all alleged human rights abuses. MEPs further urged Russia and China to condemn the lethal use of force by the regime and to impose sanctions. In the next month, the EU Parliament took the step to support the Syrian democratic opposition forces through a resolution. Clearly establishing the EU's stance on the legitimacy of the Syrian regime - there was none in their viewThe European Council, the body responsible for defining the EU's overall political direction and priorities clarified the EU's position that the Syrian people themselves had a right to decide the future of their country without the fear of repression in October 2011. High Representative of the Union Catherine Ashton also indicated that if the Syrian regime continued with its programme of repression, the EU would be forced to apply further and more comprehensive measures against the Syrian regime,9 and her statement on the 1st of February 2012 called on the UN to take strong action against the Syrian regimeFollowing the EU-US declarations, the EU stressed Al-Assad to step down from Syria's Presidency had been reiterated by the Arab League with the Kofi Annan six-point peace plans submitted on March 16, 2012, to the UN Security CouncilThe six-point plan called for a Syrian-led political process to transfer political power, a UN supervised ending of the armed conflict in Syria in order to stabilize the situation, effective coordination of humanitarian assistance, the release of arbitrarily detained persons to be sped up, freedom of movement for journalists to be ensured, and for the regime to respect the right to peacefully demonstrate as well as of freedom of associationThe European Union's policy settled in its response package JOIN 22 stated that its aim was to bring together the EU and its Member States' policies regarding the issue of justice in order to “contain and resolve the Syrian crisis to promote access to justice and accountability”. The response package engaged “multilateral fora in order to ensure the on-going and systematic violations of human rights, international humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms.” The EU played a “leading role” in dealing with the crisis and was a key driver behind the United Nations Human Rights Council's decision to form a UN Independent Commission of Inquiry. The response package went on to state that the EU “should ensure that its concerns regarding the widespread violations of human rights are addressed as an integral part of the process to bring an end to the conflict.” Additionally, the EU's position was to remain that, “if concerns about war crimes and crimes against humanity are not adequately addressed on a national level, the International Criminal Court should deal with the situation.” 13 The points in the RP were again addressed in the EU's strategy for Syria in April 2017, with the EU reiterating its demand for effective accountability for war crimes committed in the Civil WarIn the third Brussels conference, the EU emphasized again the importance of justice and accountability for a sustainable peace to take hold and suggested that the war crimes committed in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal CourtWith regards to ISIL/Da'esh, the European Council on October 2014 calculated the growing proliferation of ISIL and other radical groups in Syria as a significant threat to the security and integrity of the wider Middle East region and the world at large. The EU's High Representative presented a detailed strategy for the EU to adopt with regards to Syria, Iraq and the ISIL threats. On 16 March, 2015, the Council of the European Union provided further furnishing of the EU's role in dealing with the ISIL the crisis in Syria, entitled ""Elements for an EU Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the ISIL/Da'esh threat""The strategy aimed to: • Support the efforts of the international Coalition in countering the threat of ISIL. • Decrease the supply of foreign fighters, monetary funds and weaponry into ISIL. • Prevent further ISIL regional spill-overs and improve border security of neighbouring states. • Provide desperately needed humanitarian aid and international protection to those negatively affected by ISILThe European Council in its meeting held on December 15, 2016, repeated the EU's demand for the Syrian regime to cease hostilities in Syria immediately and committed the EU to working constructively with all partners, under the auspices of the UN, towards a political transition as agreed upon in the UNSC Resolution 2254, emphasizing the need to ensure accountability for war crimes. 18 In an April 3, 2017, the EU Council meeting adopted many decisions, agreed on the need to develop a specific strategic framework for its approach to Syria. It endorsed the objectives which framed clear lines of action on all the dimensions of the crisis, stated below. The EU's aims with regards to Syria were summarized into the following six primary areas: 19 • Instituting a genuine Syrian-led political transition ending the Syrian Civil War. • Encouraging meaningful transition in Syria to be inclusive and non-sectarian. • Fulfilling the humanitarian needs. • Promoting the principles of democracy, human rights and freedom of speech. • Promoting accountability for war crimes committed against the Syrian people. • Supporting the resilience of the Syrian population and societyEU's engagements with other international partners in Syrian peace process With regards to the political process, the EU has mostly taking a backseat role, despite the fact that together with individual member states it has engaged in, and supported the political process under the auspices of the UNFederica Mogherini, UNSC High Representative/Vice-President in March 2019 stated categorically the EU's stance on the Syrian conflict; consider it sustainable solution from a UN-led process and from the implementation of the UNSCR 2254,22 a ""road map for a peace process in Syria, setting a timetable"" for talks between the major warring parties, with responsibility for the Crisis placed on all sides so as to avoid either side outright refusing to enter into negotiationsThe UNSC's first consideration of the unfolding events in Syria took place during an unrelated meeting on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in April 2011. The United States, and EU member states, Britain, France, and Germany expressed their serious reservations and concern regarding the level of force being used by the Syrian regime against the demonstrators, while Russia considered this response an unacceptable external interference in the internal matters of Syria. The UNSC held its first session focused entirely on Syria within a few days of this previous meeting which featured South Africa, Brazil as well as other states, joining the growing number of countries condemning the actions of the regime and encouraging a speedy conclusion to the violence. They were joined by Russia, China and India who expressed their concern at the development of events in Syria. Regardless, Russia reasserted that the developing situation in Syria did not constitute any major threat to the peace and security of the international communityIn May 2011, a draft resolution sponsored by major EU member states was introduced to the Security Council denouncing the regime's crackdown of the demonstrators and called on the government to immediately cease exercising force against civilians and stressed the need for accountability. Additionally, draft resolution called upon UN member states to prevent the supply of arms and military-related material to Syria. The draft resolution rejected by the Chinese and Russians, who threatened to veto the draft. Other states including Brazil and India expressed their objections. A common concern of the delegations was that such a resolution could form the basis for an actual military intervention and subsequent regime change in Syria, as had been the case previously in LibyaAs a result of these developments, two opposing draft resolutions came under consideration in the UNSC, one drafted by the UK and the other by Russia. The later draft included certain measures such as an asset freeze on key Syrian government officials and an arms embargo that were absent from the latter. This discrepancy between the two drafts led to the UK draft removing their more contentious points in order to make the resolution more receptive. The Chinese and Russian delegations, included a condemnation of violence exercised by state-organs against civilians, as well as a threat of sanctions. The Russian draft on the other hand merely required the regime to implement the protesters-demanded reforms they had themselves agreed to implement. With the Russian draft lacking significant support and the UK draft vetoed, the UN Security Council was divided led to a deadlock. The Arab League had been quick to respond. The Arab League suspended Syria's membership of the organization stressed Assad resignation, plus demanded power transfer to the al-Assad's deputy while a new coalition government to be formed within two months and need parliamentary and presidential elections be held after a further three months. These demands were immediately and, in their entirety, rejected by al-Assad. Failing to pressure the regime into compliance the Arab League requested the UNSC to endorse its plan. The joint vetoes of both Russia and China faced severe backlash from Western states. The US ambassador expressed his “disgust” by the vetoes, the UK “appalled by the decision of Russia and China to veto”, a break from tradition for the British with the ambassador additionally saying that Russia and China had “failed in their responsibility as permanent members of the Security Council.” 26France went ahead in declaring that “history will prove wrong, and it will judge them.” 27Even the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that the vetoes will have emboldened the Syrian regime and will lead to an escalation in the violenceDespite the growing division and lack of unity in the UNSC, the UNSCs permanent members had unanimously adopted Resolution 2059 which renewed the period of the mandate of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria on 20 July 2012Unlike the UNSC, the UN Human Rights Council responded rapidly in Syria, passed a resolution in April 2011 calling for an investigation into the human rights abuses and war crimes in Syria “with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring full accountability”. The subsequent Commission of Inquiry on Syria was established for the fulfilment of this aim. Its initial reports required the Syrian regime to properly address war criminals and abuses. However, by its fourth report, the Commission recognised the inaction of the regime with regards to its reports and stated that it was “incumbent upon the Security Council, influential Member States and regional organisations to act urgently to ensure accountability”, shifting focus and impetus of action from the Syrian government to the Security Council and the wider international community. The report recommended that the UNSC “take appropriate action… by means of referral to justice, possibly to the International Criminal Court.” 30 In June 2012, Switzerland led the process by drafting a letter to the UNSC requesting a referral, noting that the credibility of the UN would be called into question should it resolve to stay unresponsive to the crimes in Syria. The letter, signed by a total of 57 states, argued that “without accountability… there will be no sustainable peace in Syria” and that even the threat to refer Syria to the ICC due to the absence of any credible process within Syria to hold those responsible accountable, the threat “would have an important dissuasive effect.”31 The letter had been signed by all EU member states barring Sweden. Sweden was of the opinion that the referral itself would pose a significant hindrance in future negotiations with the Syrian regime concerning a political settlement to the disputeHowever, the chemical attacks carried out by the regime in August 2013 raised the point that by ignoring ensuring accountability for war crimes committed early in the civil war, it has now led to the Syrian regime more confidently attacking their own population with an increase in atrocities, and conflict within the countryThe UNSC resolution 2554 became the long-sought after foundation for negotiations with the regime in Syria and served as a framework for political transition. The resolution outlined the UN's backing of a Syrian-led political process that ""establishes credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance and sets a schedule and process for drafting a new constitution"" within six months. Its other recommendations were that ""free and fair elections, pursuant to the new constitution, to be held within 18 months"" under the supervision of the UNHowever, there were still significant divisions within the UNSC over the role, if any, of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Additionally, the resolution failed due to the differing views within the permanent members of the UNSC. Actions against groups considered terrorist organisations including Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front, were not deemed violations of the cease fire, allowing Russian and the US-led coalitions air-strikes against the “Islamic State”/Daesh to continueThe resolution had effectively adopted the stance of the International Syria Support Group, providing the Vienna statement international legal backing but had significant differences, a key one being that the resolution placed responsibility for the crisis on all sides whereas the Geneva communique had singled out the regimeGeneva Peace Talks on Syria The EU had also participated in UN-sponsored talks on the future of Syria in Geneva that had presented a potential for a more long-lasting settlementThe Geneva Conferences on Syria were a UN-backed international peace conferences on the future of Syria38. Following the failure of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria, special envoy Kofi Annan sought to establish a United Nations “Action Group on Syria”, and to form a multilateral forum in order to “agree on guidelines and principles for a Syrian-led political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people”. In June 2012 in Geneva conference was attended by the five permanent members of the UNSC as well as officials from Qatar, Turkey, Kuwait, Iraq and a representative from the EU, but none from Iran - a key player in the Syrian crisisThe conference paved the way for a political settlement, calling for the establishment of a power-sharing regime that would, surprisingly, include both members of the government and the resistanceThe Syrian Civil War continued, with both the regime and opposition forces attempting to gain an advantage over the other before a ceasefire for negotiations came into effect in order to position themselves as in as powerful a position for those negotiationsThe Geneva II talks in January 2014, to create a process agreeable to both the parties on achieving a political end to the crisis, but failed. The Geneva II negotiations were failures due to three main factors. First, there was no common ground between the involved parties over which armed organizations should be counted to be part of the “Syrian opposition”. Syrian Kurds under the Yekîneyên Parastina Gel were largely excluded out of the process due to Turkish objections. Second, the exiled group that officially represented the Syrian opposition, the Syrian Interim Government, at the Geneva II talks had limited contact with or even control over the rebel units and fighters on the ground. Third, Assad had no incentive to participate as US was not in his favourThe failure of the Geneva II talks to yield any result that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fought through and captured large swathes of Syria and then crossed the border into Iraq, seizing land and shifting the focus of the international community from peacemaking between the Assad regime and the Syrian opposition in the civil war itself to combating the terrorist group that made constantly headlines due to their actions. The United States increased its support to rebels fighting such as the Kurds and brought together a coalition of countries to defeat ISIL in 2014The third round of talks of Geneva began in 2016, failed due to Syrian regime retaliation, backed by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militia support, against the oppositions-held areas around the city of Aleppo. While the international community sought to establish a process without the cooperation of the Syrian regime, the Syrian government itself sought to dictate the reality on the groundThe proceeding Geneva peace talks IV, V, VI in, VII, and VIII on Syria collapsed with no breakthroughWith the escalation of violence in eastern Gouta and Idlib, Russia sponsored peace talks on the settlement of the Syrian conflict in Astana in 2017, and then in Sochi in January 2018 undermining the multilateral process being undertaken by the UNIn the 8th round of the Geneva Intra-Syrian peace talks in December 2017, a declaration was issued that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad definitively did not have a role to play in the country's future political transitionFriends of Democratic Syria Group/ Friends of Syria The deadlock and subsequent inaction in the UNSC following Russian and Chinese vetoes prompted the US and France to initiate the creation of a group in February 2012 that was referred to as the Friends of Democratic Syria Group/Friends of Syria. It holds no official international status; it is more akin to a group of like-minded states and international institutions that set up a forum to discuss the ongoing crisis in Syria outside of the UN Security Council rather than an actual political entity aimed at providing a workable, agreed upon solution to the conflictThe Friends of Syria group held its first conference in Tunis in February 2012 with 60 countries sending delegations including representatives from the UN, the EU, the Arab League, the OIC, Arab Maghreb Union and the GCC. Besides affirming their firm commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of Syria, they condemned the Syrian regime's widespread human rights violations and their failure to stop despite the international outcry. The group reiterated the crucial need to hold those responsible for perpetrating crimes against the Syrian people and end the impunity enjoyed by those perpetratorsThe Group intent was to take the proper political and economic measures in order to apply pressure on the regime to end its continued human rights violations and prevent the further escalation instability. These agenda point of groups of friends included the following: • Travel ban on the officials of the Syrian government. • Freezing the personal assets of officials of the Assad government. • Ending the purchase of Syrian hydrocarbon products. • Ceasing infrastructure investment in, and financial services relating to, Syria. • To decrease diplomatic relations with the Syrian government. • Prevent the shipment of weapons and related equipments to the Syrian governmentThe Friends' Group additionally recognized the Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrians and sought to increase its communication with and material support for the Syrian opposition forcesThe Friends Group met the seventh time in May 2013 in Amman and demanded that Hezbollah militias and Iran immediately withdraw from the countryWithin the Friends of Syria, the core faction were the London 11 comprising of the US, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar. The London 11's meeting in October 2013 was to persuade the leadership of the National Coalition to attend a major peace conference in Geneva next month. They reiterated their stance on the issue that a transition government should be established as part of the final political settlement and that President Bashar al-Assad could play no role in any future governmentIn January 2014 the London 11 held a joint meeting with the Syrian National Coalition in Paris strongly condemned the refusal of the Syrian regime to attend the Geneva negotiations. The Syrian regime yet again found itself condemned by the international community by its violation of UNSC Resolution 2118. Also, the regime's insistence that any future presidential election would have Assad running for office, would be a violation of the Geneva II processFederica Mogherini, EU's High Representative on May 9, 2016 expressed the support of the EU to the joint statement by Russia and the US on the need to reinitiate the ceasefires as a preliminary step to prepare the groundwork for the next meeting of the ISSG. She also made clear to Riad Hijab, Syrian opposition general coordinator, that the Group's expectations of their readiness to engage in the Geneva talks under the leadership of the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, to make the political talks in Geneva work and hence provide a perspective for the countryThe International Syria Support Group The ISSG was established in October 2015 to facilitate the discussions and negotiations at a ministerial level and to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria. The participants of the ISSG were the US, Russia, the European Union, China, Iran, Turkey, the Arab League, and the UN. The Co-Chairs of the ISSG are Russia and the U.SThe ISSG met in Vienna, Austria on October 30, 2015 and on November 14, 2015 consequently to resolve the conflict in Syria, developed “mutual understanding” on a number of issues, including that “Syria's unity, independence, territorial integrity, and secular character fundamental” and that “the rights of all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity or religious denomination must be protected.”57 However, the failure of these meetings was that due to the fact it does not include any reference to, nor any plan how to effectively process perpetrators of war crimes, a system of justice and a mechanism for a transitional governments be implemented. These statements would however, despite their perceived faults, eventually become the foundations of the UNSC Resolution 2254 - which also excluded any mention of justice and accountabilityThe ISSG, in a meeting held in Munich in February 2016, issued their united approval and support of the UNSC Resolution 225459, the Vienna Statements of 2015 and the Geneva communique 2012The ISSG committed themselves to a Syrian-led and owned political transition based completely upon the Geneva Communique, stressing the need to end the indiscriminate use of weapons, implement a Syrian-wide ceasefire, facilitate immediate humanitarian access to areas under siege, release any arbitrarily detained people and fight terrorist groupsBrussels conferences The European Union, Germany, Britain, Norway, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Nations convened a Conference in Brussels focused on “Supporting the future of Syria and the region”, in April, 2017The EU and the UN co-chaired the second and third conference on 'Supporting the future of Syria and the region', which held in Brussels in April 2018 and in March 2019. The overall aim of the three Syria Conferences had been to provide much needed support to Syrian people plus gather support of the international community to achieve a political solution to the Syria crisis, along the lines of the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and the Geneva Communique. The Brussels III also focused on the humanitarian crisis affecting the Syrian populace as well as the international communities hosting Syrian refugees. It additionally stated the international community's intention to provide political and financial support for Syria's neighbours who had undertaken an unbalanced and primary burden of having to host Syrian refugees, notably Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. 63 The last Brussels conference reaffirmed the need for justice and accountability for war crimes for maintaining sustainable and genuine peace and hence called for the issue of the Syrian civil war be referred to the ICCEU's Restrictive Measures Following the beginning of the civil war in Syria in 2011 and the resulting constant escalation and widespread violations of human rights, the EU adopted many restrictive actions towards Syria. The EU's first step against the Syrian regime, was to adopt “The Council of the European Union, Regulation No. 442/2011 of 9 May 2011 concerning “restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria”. Regulation 442/2011 represented an early example of the broader and future EU strategy and described measures to be undertaken with regards to SyriaSince then, the EU has suspended bilateral cooperation with the Syrian regime and froze the Association Agreement that had been under negotiation before the outbreak of war, in response to the Syrian regime's high handed repression of the peaceful anti-government protests. All of these restrictive actions were undertaken before any thought-out strategy towards Syria was outlined, either from the EU or any other state or international organization. A strategy for Syria was outlined in June 2013 two years after the joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, presenting these measures as steps “towards a comprehensive EU approach to the Syrian crisis”Before the war, the EU was the fourth largest trading partner for Syria after Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. With the implementation of the EU's restrictive measures lead to bilateral trade volumes contracting substantially over the years, to decrease to only €0billion in 2016, whereby imports from Syria dropped by 97% and exports by 85% as compared to 2011The EU suspended the participation of the Assad regime in the regional programs and institutions such as the European Investment Bank, with the EIB suspending all loan operations and technical assistance to the Syrian governmentThe EU established and then expanded a list of targeted sanctions, including an arms embargo, asset freeze and a travel ban on select key government officials69 which was extended to May 2018 and will remain in place until June 2019Now the European Union extended restrictive measures until June 2020. President Assad and his family were also included on the sanction list in May 2013, and an oil embargo was imposed. Syria consequently suspended its membership of and participation in the Union for the Mediterranean in retaliationThe EU put full and complete arms embargo on Syria for two years in response to the violent repression of peaceful protestors by Syrian government forces and the following spiral into civil warHowever, the EU faced difficulties in developing a coherent policy that would enable them to adopt a strong role in handling the crisis on an international level. The EU's position was further damaged when some countries and groups, among them the Friends of Syria, realized that the EU arms embargo had mostly failed in its purpose and had inadvertently hurt the position of the Syrian Opposition Coalition and the armed groups recognizing its authority. With the supply of weaponry from Russia and Iran, the Gulf States and Croatia, neither the regime nor the jihadist armed groups had been seriously limited by the EU weapons embargoThe EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Dublin on March 22, 2013, France and the UK proposed to lift or amend the EU arms embargo to make exceptions for the sale and transfer of weapons to the Syrian opposition simultaneously armed Free Syrian Army in order ""to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria"". While, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden showed their reservations, especially on the practicality of the assurances given by the Britain and France that weaponry could be directed to moderate rebel groupings and kept out of the hands of the more radical Islamist elements in Syria - Germany and Austria, favored easing economic sanctions on rebel-held areas of Syria to strengthen the rebel's position. This apprehensive environment pleaded that if a consensus to renew arms embargo by June 1st could not be reached, then not just the arms embargo but all other EU sanctions against the Syrian regime would lapseFurther, British and French determination to act alone, not only confirmed this possibility, but also led to extension of the Syrian conflictThe common approach of the EU member states towards the arms embargo was doomed by May 2013, and the member countries opted to pursue their own independent policies towards Syria. The fractional approach in Syrian conflict was again demonstrated when the EU opposed direct military intervention in Syria in retaliation to the alleged chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013 by the Syrian regime on the outskirts of Damascus which had resulted in hundreds of civilian dead in direct contravention of international humanitarian lawThe EU President on November 2013 adopted a neutral position calling for a political solution to the crisis in Syria, with military intervention in Syria being supported only by France and the United Kingdom. Subsequently, the UK government forced to adopt a policy against military intervention when the UK Parliament rejected the possibility of UK military action in Syria in a vote in August 2013Germany also avoided joining the US-led coalition bombing Syria on a constitutional basis since foreign German military deployment requires a change in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of GermanyIn April 2018, the European Council supported the American, French and British airstrikes on chemical weapons facilities in Syria by emphasizing that the EU's stance on the crisis remained to seek a political solution to the dispute within the framework of the UN-led Geneva processHowever, the response of the EU and its member countries to strikes clearly exposed the strengths and weaknesses of European power. While individual member states wielded the power and ability to engage in military action, the EU in its entirety was paralyzed to do so due to the multiplicity of views within its organization. This weakness being exploited and fostered by countries such as Russia to the benefit of the Syrian regime, which has a clear interest in keeping Europe dividedIn May 17, 2019, the EU Council extended restrictive measures against the Assad regime and its supporters due to the continued repression of the civilian population until June 1, 2020, in line with the broader EU strategy on Syria. The sanctions currently in place against Syria include an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank held in the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression or for war as well as on equipment and technology for the monitoring or interception of the internet or telephone communications. The EU believes that there can be no sustainable, and legitimate military solution to the Syrian civil war and remains committed to finding a lasting and credible political solution to the conflict in Syria as held in the UNSC resolution 2254 and in the 2012 Geneva CommuniqueThis stance also endorsed by the EU's High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the UNSC in March 2019Humanitarian Assistance With regards to the international aid to the victims of the Syrian civil war, the EU and its Member States took the lead. In March of 2019, the Brussels Conference managed to obtain pledges for aid totaling €8billion for 2019-20 and beyond, out of which €6billion was for 2019 after which €2billion was pledged yearly. Of the overall pledge, roughly 2/3 was from the European Union which had contributed a total of €6billion: €2billion from the EU budget managed by the European Commission and €4billion from individual member states. Out of the €2billion from EU budget, €2billion was committed for 2019 while €560 million was committed for 2020 for vulnerable Syrians within Syria and refugees in countries in the region. 83 To date, millions of people have been helped by EU humanitarian assistance, aid such as emergency medical treatment, healthcare, psycho-social support, protection of children and vulnerable people, food, safe drinking water, essential items, and shelters. 84 Since 2011, the EU's humanitarian funding has amounted to €580 million. In Jordan, the EU supports almost 660,000 Syrian refugees, most of them women and children, by supplying cash assistance, protection, and healthcare. In 2017, €55 million of the EU's humanitarian funding allocated to Jordan also targeted the emergency needs of more than 45,000 refugees stranded along its northeastern border with Syria and Iraq. Another €36 million was allocated for 2018. In Egypt, which hosts upwards of 122,000 registered refugees, the EU has allocated €7million to help refugees living in substandard conditions in urban areas through healthcare, education and cash assistance. Since 2012, the EU's humanitarian aid to Lebanon has reached around 750,000 Syrians. An additional €4 million was earmarked for 2018In Turkey, there are an estimated 4 million refugees, of whom 3million are SyrianThe EU had pledged €6 billion in aid to refugees in Turkey. However, since June 2019 only €2billion were disbursedConclusion The geographical proximity of Europe to the Middle East means that Europe cannot ignore the internal developments that take place in the neighbouring states in the Middle Eastern region. The effects of the refugee crisis are huge on the EU. In the Syrian civil war, the EU re-focused its attention from economic and political partnerships with Syria to the application of sanctions and scaling down of its mission in Damascus. The aim undoubtedly was to punish the Syrian regime for their human rights violations but the secondary effects of these measures was the reduction of the EU's political leverage within Syria and a worsening state of existence for the already battered populace. The EU sacrificed what political leverage it had when it joined the US in pursuing Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to step down without having the power to force. With the increasing influence of Iran and Russian air support for the current Syrian regime and Assad's triumph over most of his rivals on the battlefields of Syria, his resignation seems an unattainable goal without the cooperation of Syria's supporters, Russia, Iran and China. To further make the situation worse for the US and its allies. All of these factors helped compounded the already worsening refugee and humanitarian crisis taking place in Syria. The EU has taken a back seat with regards to who has the leading role in the conflict. This stems from the EU's institutional make-up, with the 28 member states of the EU all failing to find a common stance on the issue, and without a common stance, the EU is internally paralyzed as to what its role in the conflict should be? What is common amongst all the members states regarding the conflict are their primary concerns, those being migration and terrorism. The EU's fractured response to these issues has mainly been due to the wave of far-right political developments in its member states such as ‘Brexit' in the UK and the rise of the AfD in Germany, developments that threaten the integrity of the Union. Hence, demonstrating how events in Syria have had drastic socio-political consequences for Europe. The major players in the EU with regards to the Syrian crisis are France, Germany and the UK. Each with their own aims regarding the role that they have as individual states, and collectively as a Union. The smaller member states have to choose to fall in line with one of the “big three”, for example: the Netherlands has decided to side with the German position and hesitate over military intervention, choosing to push more responsibility towards the UN Security Council. The major question of how far member states are willing to militarily intervene is another issue in this crisis that the EU member states have been unable to find a consensus on. Some member states will argue that military intervention remains the only meaningful and practical option to remove Assad from power and others will express their reluctance towards it, arguing that military action will only make the situation worse. Libya is a case in point. So, instead of a military intervention support, the anti-interventionist states support revitalizing the failed UN-sponsored Geneva talks among the warring actors in Syria. The EU has been able to agree upon is embargo on Syria, blocking the sale of arms and setting in place economic sanctions against the regime. The Syrian regime is trying to mitigate the effects of crippling EU and European Investment Bank sanctions by turning towards its allies Russia and Iran. Syrian goods found markets in Iraq and Lebanon while the Russian banking sector helped make funds available that the EIB had withdrawn or made unavailable. The oil embargo that proved crippling initially for Assad's forces was sidestepped with imports from Russia and Iran. These efforts helped reduce the impact of the EU's sanctions, allowing Assad to continue the war and further diminished already crumbling EU political leverage over Syria. Another key aspect of the EU's role in Syria is its coordination with the US with regards to sanctions and for individual member states, limited military intervention. In the initial stages of the conflict the US and the EU, restricted themselves but the cumulative effects of the civil war forced them. It was in response to the growing radical Islamist presence in Syria that the US, moved to take military action against them. The EU however, still lacking a consensus, was too paralyzed to follow the US's footsteps and engage even the terrorist organisations militarily. The EU is still searching for the common stance towards the conflict. The EU's focus on soft power projection, preference for legal solutions, and enthusiasm for multilateral diplomacy, has found it struggling to change the direction of the Syrian conflict, a conflict that is seen to be dominated by hard power politics in an increasingly multipolar world. The EU has often tried, and failed in many regards, to be a crisis manager, whether it be in Syria, Libya or in the Ukraine crisis. It's lack of hard power capabilities has played a vital role in its failures. This military deficiency, that will continue for the foreseeable future, as well as the limitations of soft power projection were major reasons behind the EU failing to achieve its stated objections. Having made tall demands of Syria and lacking any ways of forcing compliance the EU finds itself in a difficult position, a position where the only options are an insistence on Assad's resignation or a retraction of their earlier stance and an attempt to reach a compromise with the regime. None of the options are good for the image and standing of the EU. The EU will further lose clout in the international arena, making its weaker among the international actors. There are, however, a number of possible actions the EU can take in order to regain some of its lost influence in the Syrian crisis: 1. The EU can bargain its economic strengths in return for concessions from the regime during negotiations: All the pre-war agreements between the EU and Syria, such as the Association agreement and cooperation programmes such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the economic support of the European Investment Bank with its loan operations and technical assistance to the regime, can be used as incentives for the Syrian regime to be more compliant in its behaviour. Additional benefits from such a move would be to combat Syria's war economy by re-legalising Syria's formal economy. It would help in providing more humanitarian aid in more parts of Syria to those who need it most. The EU can also send a monitoring mission to ensure local ceasefires in Syria are upheld as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy. The EU can also increase its support and aid for the local, democratic and legitimate actors in particular the Local Administrative Councils in Opposition-held Syria or LACs.

a54bc958-01ad-4ad0-95e7-125ff58da849,"Uncertainty over the US presidential election outcome could negatively affect global affairs, mostly the economy, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. ""Any uncertainty in the most powerful world economy in one of the largest countries has and could potentially have negative consequences for global affairs, first of all for global economy,"" Peskov said. ""Meanwhile, we will see how long this uncertainty period lasts and how strong this influence is,"" he noted. The spokesman declined to comment on the latest election developments due to lack of clarity. ""The results of the US election haven't been announced yet and it's impossible to make comments in the current situation,"" he said. ""We would rather take our time and wait for the situation to become clearer."" Any comments by Russia on the US election would be ""like a red rag to a bull,"" Dmitry Peskov added. Neither would he make any comments regarding the fact that the US had not accused Russia of meddling in the current presidential election so far. ""Unfortunately, everything related to our country is like a red rag to a bull in the US, so let's refrain from making comments right now. I think that the Americans should deal with their affairs on their own,"" the spokesman said. Nationwide, American citizens headed to the polls on November 3 to elect 435 representatives to the House, 35 senators out of 100 to the Senate, and the President and Vice President of the United States. The November race for the White House pits Democratic contender Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris against incumbent US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence of the Republican Party. In addition, voters decided on 13 US state and territorial governorships, and numerous other local elections were held. The winner of the presidential race is still not known. According to a forecast by Fox News, incumbent President Donald Trump has secured 214 electoral votes, while Democratic candidate Joe Biden received 264. To win the presidency, a candidate needs 270 out of 538 electoral votes."

0c9e3f96-1284-46e1-88c4-a4979143f4fe,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin have discussed concerns as tensions increase between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces. Angela Merkel has called on the Kremlin to unwind its recent military buildup near eastern Ukraine, the chancellor's office announced in a statement released Thursday. Recent clashes between pro-Russia separatists and government forces have sparked fears of an escalation in the conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region. During a phone call, Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed other topics, as well, including the imprisonment of the Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny. What did the Kremlin say? Following the call, the Kremlin also released a statement saying the two leaders had ""expressed concerns over the escalation of tensions in the southeast of Ukraine."" ""Vladimir Putin drew attention to the provocative actions of Kyiv, which has recently been purposefully exacerbating the situation on the front line,"" according to the statement. The deputy head of Russia's presidential administration, Dmitry Kozak, was quoted by the TASS agency on Thursday as saying that any major military hostilities could mean ""the beginning of the end of Ukraine."" He argued that Russia would be forced to defend its citizens in eastern Ukraine. What is the situation in Donbass? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was headed to Donbass on Thursday. He said he was ""going to the locations of the escalation,"" adding that ""Ukraine needs peace and will do everything for this."" Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of escalating tensions between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists. On March 26 alone, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recorded hundreds of ceasefire violations. Ukraine's government has repeatedly called on Russia to pull its troops away from the border, with the Kremlin responding that internal troop movements are a domestic issue and arguing that it is entitled to protect Russian-speaking citizens in Donbass if the shaky ceasefire does not hold. The European Union, NATO and the US have recently condemned the Russian military buildup on the border. The conflict has killed at least 14,000 people since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to Ukraine's government.

aabf16cb-ab64-45aa-a4c3-8ab83cc424a3,"The US and several European governments have called for the immediate release of leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny after he was detained at a Moscow airport on Sunday. The opposition figure, 44, was returning home from a convalescence in Germany five months after an attempt on his life in a nerve agent poisoning he blames on Russian authorities. President Vladimir Putin's government has denied responsibility for the attack. On Monday morning, Navalny was being held in a Moscow police cell and had yet to be granted access to his lawyers. The US and the EU led calls on Monday for Putin's fiercest critic to be released, but have stopped short of threatening retaliatory action. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""deeply troubled"" at the news of Navalny's arrest. In a thinly-veiled rebuke of the Russian government, he added that ""confident political leaders do not fear nor see the need to commit violence against or wrongfully detain, political opponents"". ""I condemn the detention of Alexei Navalny yesterday by the Russian authorities, upon his return to Russia. The Russian authorities must immediately release him and ensure his safety. Detention of political opponents is against Russia's international commitments,"" said a statement from European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen. ""We also continue to expect a thorough and independent investigation on the attack on Alexei Navalny's life,"" it went on. Taking to Twitter, Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, issued a demand for Russian authorities to release Navalny immediately, branding the move to detain him as ""unacceptable"". Other EU countries have also added their voice to calls for the politician to be freed. France expressed ""great concern"" at the news and urged for his immediate release. ""Together with its European partners, it is following his situation with the utmost vigilance and calls for his immediate release,"" the French foreign ministry said in a statement. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Navalny's arrest is ""incomprehensible"" and that ""he should be released immediately."" ""Navalny was the victim of a serious poisoning attack on Russian soil. We continue to expect that Russia does everything possible to fully investigate this attack and to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" he added. His British counterpart, Dominic Raab, wrote on Twitter that Navalny's arrest is ""appalling"". ""Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,"" he went on. In a post on Twitter, Canada's foreign minister Marc Garneau said Navalny's detention was ""unacceptable,"" adding that ""Canada strongly condemns"" his arrest. ""Russian authorities must immediately release him,"" he said. ""We will continue to demand an explanation into his poisoning,"" Garneau added. 'Why should I be arrested?' Navalny had defied warnings from Russian authorities in returning home, particularly from Russia's prison service which had said that he faced immediate arrest upon his return to the country. Dozens of Navalny's supporters, journalists and riot police units were waiting for him at Vnukovo airport. His plane landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport from Berlin after being diverted from its planned destination, according to Euronews correspondent Galina Polonskaya who was on board. She said Navalny seemed relaxed during the plane journey and was joking with reporters during the flight. He refused to give any interviews on the plane and when someone shouted to him asking if he was afraid of being arrested he laughed and replied: ""Me, arrested? Why should I be arrested?"" The pilot of the plane first announced a delay of 30 minutes before indicating that the plane was heading for Sheremetyevo and would not land at Vnukovo airport as scheduled due to a ""technical problem"", Polonskaya said. Navalny told his team that he had not expected this to happen, adding: ""This shows to what extent they are afraid of me"". The Russian opposition leader announced on Wednesday that he would return to his homeland after recovering from being poisoned with a nerve agent, despite Russian authorities' threats to put him behind bars again. Navalny, who has blamed his poisoning in August on the Kremlin, said that Putin was now trying to deter him from coming home with new legal motions. Moscow has repeatedly denied a role in the opposition leader's poisoning. At the end of December, Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service warned Navalny that he faced time in prison if he fails to immediately report to its office. The organisation said this was consistent with a suspended sentence and probation he received for a 2014 conviction on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, which the opposition leader rejected as politically motivated. The European Court for Human Rights had ruled that his conviction was unlawful. The FSIN said Thursday it issued an arrest warrant for Navalny after he failed to report to its office. The prison service, which has asked a Moscow court to turn Navalny's 3-year suspended sentence into a real one, said it's ""obliged to take all the necessary action to detain Navalny pending the court's ruling"". Security measures at Vnukovo airport were heightened on Sunday, with several prisoner-transport trucks parked outside. Exposure to Novichok On August 20, 2020, Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to one in Berlin two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. They refused to open a full criminal inquiry into the incident, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned. Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service who he purports poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake."
62952a80-9f63-4706-a6a6-861218b841cd,"The international community has called for the release of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, arrested yesterday on arrival at Moscow Airport on a flight from Berlin, after announcing last week's return to his country. One of his lawyers, Efe reported, has reported on Monday that the police do not allow access to his client: ""I, a defense attorney with power of attorney, do not allow me access to him ; they say he's sleeping. Of course, they make no reference to the law,"" the lawyer Viacheslav Guimadi wrote on his Twitter account. He added that the opposition leader is in the premises of Department 2 of Jimki's Interior Ministry, Moscow's satellite city, near Sheremetyevo International Airport, where he was arrested. The United States, the European Union and human rights organizations demanded the immediate release of the Russian politician. ""Mr. Navalny should be released immediately, and those responsible for the unacceptable attack on his life must be held accountable,"" Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to President-elect Joe Biden, wrote in a message posted on Twitter. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also ruled on the case and condemned ""Russia's decision"" to arrest Navalny, ""the last in a series of attempts to silence him and other opposition figures."" The UK demanded the release of the opponent and said Moscow should explain how he was attacked with a chemical weapon, Reuters reported. ""It is appalling that Alexei Navalny, the victim of a despicable crime, has been arrested by the Russian authorities. He must be released immediately,"" said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. ""Instead of pursuing Mr. Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon was used on Russian soil."" ""An offense to Europe"" For his part, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the high representative for the European Union's Foreign Policy, Josep Borrell, called for the immediate release of the Russian opponent, after calling his detention ""unacceptable"". The President of the Eurochamber, David Sassoli, considered the arrest in Moscow an ""offense"" to the international community and to Europe. ""The arrest of Alexei Navalny on arrival in Moscow is unacceptable. I ask the Russian authorities to release him immediately,"" Michel wrote on his Twitter account, which as President of the Council represents the governments of the Twenty-Seven. Also on his account on the same social network, Borrell stressed that ""the Russian authorities must respect Navalny and release him immediately"", since for the head of European diplomacy ""the politicization of the judiciary is unacceptable"". Navalny's arrest is ""an offense to the international community, to Europe that helped save his life,"" the President of the European Parliament also added in Twiter. The President of the Eurochamber also expressed his readiness to ""invite"" him back to the EP, which last September requested an international investigation involving the EU, the UN, the Council of Europe, its allies and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the case of the poisoning of the Russian opponent. In a telematics appearance before the Eurochamber at the end of last November, Navalny called on Brussels to include Putin's circle among those sanctioned for his poisoning. The EU last October approved imposing navalny sanctions on six prominent members of the Russian Administration,he is responsible for his attempted ""murder"" with the neurotoxic agent of the Novichok family, including the head of the secret services. The leaders of Poland and the Baltic countries called on the EU to act and to take ""restrictive measures"" against Russia. Germany's German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas today urged Russia to ""immediately release"" the opponent. Navalny, recovered after a poisoning in August, ""made the conscious decision to return to Russia, which he considers his personal and political home,"" and the fact that he was arrested by the Russian authorities as long as he arrived ""is totally incomprehensible,"" Maas said. The Social Democratic Minister, recognizing that Russia is bound by its own Constitution and its international obligations to the rule of law and the protection of civil rights, added: ""Of course, these principles must also be applied"" to Navalny, who ""should be released immediately."" Germany urges Russia to ""investigate in depth the poisoning of Navalny and bring the perpetrators to justice,"" Maas reiterated. France also demanded ""immediate release"" yesterday, Afp reported. ""France knew, with strong concern, of Alexei Navalni's arrest in Russia. continues, with its European partners, its situation with the greatest vigilance and urges its immediate release,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The Kremlin responded this morning through its foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and argues that expressions of outrage from Western countries are designed to distract their own citizens from internal problems. ""Prisoner of conscience"" As soon as the arrest was known, Amnesty International demanded the release of the lawyer by profession, which he called a ""prisoner of conscience"", while the three Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, called the European Union ""restrictive measures"" against Russia. From Venezuela, opposition leader Juan Guaidó yesterday called for the release of the Russian politician: ""The arbitrary detention of Navalny evidences a clear violation of human rights by one of the main allies of the (Nicolás) Maduro regime,"" Guaidó said on his Twitter account. The leader thus called for his release and called on the world to ""act together in its defense, and against the pursuit of dissent."" Five months of treatment The 44-year-old opposition politician was intercepted last night by police officers in passport control and prevented his lawyer from accompanying him, according to images broadcast live by various digital media outlets. Navalni returned to Russia last night after nearly five months of medical treatment and rehabilitation in Germany due to poisoning with a military toxic substance for which he was a victim in Siberia and for which Russian President Vladimir Putin is directly responsible. His arrest, according to the Russian Federal Prison Service, which issued the search-and-find order, was due to Navalny's failure to comply with the conditions of a 3-year suspended prison sentence against him in 2014. ""Alexei was tried to kill him. They couldn't and now try to imprison him for a conviction that the European Court of Human Rights declared illegal,"" Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter.

Russian prison services confirmed in a statement the arrest of 44-year-old Navalny, who will ""continue to be detained until the court's decision"" on his case. The opponent was flying back from Germany, where he spent several months recovering from an alleged poisoning he attributed to Russian Special Services by direct order from President Vladimir Putin. According to the FSIN, Navalny failed to comply when he was in Germany in the conditions of the 2014 conviction, which forces him to appear at least twice a week in the prison administration. The main figure of the Russian opposition suddenly fell into a coma in August, when he was returning from a trip to Siberia. He was initially hospitalized in Omsk, but was evacuated a few days later to a Berlin hospital. Three European laboratories concluded that he was poisoned with a Novichok-type nerve agent, developed in Soviet times, a conclusion confirmed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons . Moscow denies it and accuses The Western Secret Services and Navalni's life hygiene. Following the arrest, Amnesty International demanded the immediate release of the Russian opponent.

4eb0af67-2739-4f57-ae62-2efabdd16c2b,"A senior Russian official accused Washington of changing its priorities, rejecting stability, and attempting to gain supremacy - in particular, of leaving arms control agreements so it can build up its military potential. Speaking to Moscow's newspaper of record, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Deputy Minister of Defense Alexander Fomin expressed the hope that the US would change its stance once President-elect Joe Biden took office in January. The United States has been pushing ahead with a policy aimed at building up its military power for a long time, Fomin said, adding, Under far-fetched pretexts, the American side renounces its arms control treaty obligations that prevent the achievement of global dominance. On February 5, 2021, the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia is due to expire, with President Donald Trump believing its terms to be unfair on Washington and therefore not renewing it. America's reluctance to extend the agreement is the latest in a series of deals to which the White House has put an end. In particular, Fomin noted the US' withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. The Kremlin supported both treaties, and continues to push for arms control between the two superpowers. On pulling out of the INF, Washington accused Russia of violating the agreement, arguing that Russia's 9M729 missile broke the rules. Now the US is no longer part of the INF, Russia has asked NATO to agree with Russia not to deploy intermediate- and short-range missiles, with the threat that it will take adequate response measures if the Western military bloc doesn't accept. With regard to New START, which has less than six weeks left to run, Fomin noted how Russia has repeatedly asked the US to extend the treaty in order to start working on a new agreement, taking into account the concerns of both Washington and Moscow. As I've already said, the American side has other priorities, and therefore they don't show any interest in extending the START Treaty, he stated. Biden has voiced his support for New START and criticized the current incumbent for pulling out of the deal. Once he is inaugurated on January 20, he would have two weeks to agree to an extension with the Kremlin. Due to the current political situation in the United States, we can't exclude the possibility that the American position on this issue may change, Fomin concluded."
7fa4fba5-bae4-4ca3-b61a-e14e2cd05f15,"Bangladesh has approached Russia to use its good offices with Myanmar's junta to bring them around to taking back Rohingya refugees, after a China-led effort failed in facilitating it. Dhaka has urged Russia to launch a 'trilateral initiative' with Myanmar, like China did, to resolve the crisis, brought on by Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar to escape the military's campaign. Foreign minister AK Abdul Momen told reporters that he had made the proposal to his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting in Tashkent last week on the sidelines of the international conference on connectivity. Momen was speaking to reporters in Dhaka after his return from Central Asia. ""I told Lavrov that we have tried a lot bilaterally with Myanmar and even tri-laterally involving China. But in the last four years, not a single Rohingya returned,"" the Bangladesh foreign minister said. ""So, I told him to help us. I told him that you can take a trilateral initiative as you have good relations with them and they will listen, if you say."" Momen recalled that for the first time, Russia and China gave their support in adopting the ""Human Rights Situation of Rohingya Muslims and other Minorities in Myanmar"" resolution in the UN recently. It's a shift,"" he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution by consensus is a ""big milestone"" towards negotiation of Rohingya repatriation. According to sources, Lavrov did not make any commitment straightaway, as any such initiative will be a tightrope walk for Moscow, given that Myanmar's junta is one of the biggest customers of Russian-origin defence equipment in SE Asia and has decided to tilt towards Russia for defence purchases, rather than China. In 2020, the current military junta chief of Myanmar, who was then commander of the armed forces, was among the few senior dignitaries who attended the Victory Day parade in Moscow. Also, the general was in Moscow recently. People in the know said Russia has plans to sell fighter aircraft to Myanmar's junta. However, on the other hand, Russia enjoys goodwill with the ruling Awami League government for its role during the 1971 war of independence and backing India through Indo-Soviet Friendship Treaty and in the UNSC. Russia's nuclear major Rosatom is constructing Bangladesh's only nuclear power plant and has a trilateral with its Indian counterpart for providing assistance to the project. Russia is emerging as a key negotiator in various conflict theatres in Asia, which includes Syria and Afghanistan. Since August 25, 2017, Bangladesh has hosted over 1million forcefully displaced Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar district, who arrived there after a military crackdown in Myanmar, which the UN called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and other rights groups dubbed as ""genocide"". In the last nearly four years, not a single Rohingya has returned home, although Myanmar has agreed to take them back. The tripartite discussion between Bangladesh and Myanmar mediated by China was started in 2019, and following a series of meetings at ministerial, secretary and high official levels, Naypyidaw had hinted that it would start taking back Rohingyas from the second quarter of this year. But the tripartite discussion has been suspended since the coup."

Prague has accused Moscow of involvement in the blast at Vrebtice, which killed two people. In April, the Czech Prime Minister said they had ""irrefutable evidence"" that two Russian GRU agents were behind the depot explosion. Russia has denied any involvement. On Monday the Czech Foreign Ministry announced that had summoned Russia's ambassador to Prague to request full compensation for damages caused by the explosion. ""The Czech Republic has invoked international responsibility of Russia for Vrbìtice,"" a statement read. The ministry said deputy Foreign Minister Martin Smolek handed Ambassador Aleksandr Zmeyevsky a diplomatic note, requesting ""full reparation for the injury caused by this internationally wrongful act"". Prague also said they had invited Russia to enter into negotiations on this matter. The allegations have resulted in a serious diplomatic crisis between the Czech Republic and Russia, with dozens of diplomats ordered to leave their respective embassies. Moscow has listed the Czech Republic as an ""unfriendly state"" that has ""carried out unfriendly actions"" against Russia. But Smolek told Zmeyevsky that the Czech Republic's inclusion on the list was a violation of international law and called on Moscow to cancel the measure. The same two Russians named by the Czech Republic in their investigation into Vrebitce are also suspected by British authorities of poisoning former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018."

""In the interests of easing tensions in bilateral relations, the Czech Republic urges Russia to stop labeling it and other states as countries making unfriendly steps against Russia, and drop the associated measures,"" the ministry said. ""We will hardly be able to return to regular diplomatic communication and begin to think about possible complete normalization of bilateral relations without this step,"" the ministry quoted Minister Jakub Kulhanek as saying. ""It should be noted that we think that steps linked with compiling a list of unfriendly countries run counter to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" On May 14, Russia released a government-endorsed list of unfriendly countries, featuring only the United States and the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic will be allowed to hire no more than 19 Russian nationals or citizens of third countries to work for its embassy, and the United States, not a single one. On the same day, the Czech foreign ministry said it considered Russia's move as ""a further step towards escalation"" in relations with the Czech Republic, the European Union and its partners. Relations between Russia and the Czech Republic soured after April 17 when the Czech authorities claimed that Russia was allegedly behind the blasts at munitions depots in the village of Vrbetice in the east of the Czech Republic in 2014 and expelled 18 Russian diplomats who, it claimed, were officers of Russian intelligence services. The Russian foreign ministry expressed resolute protests following Prague's step made ""under ungrounded and far-fetched pretexts"" and declared 20 employees of the Czech embassy in Moscow personae non gratae. Later, the sides agreed to align the embassies' personnel on a parity basis. From June 1, each of them will be allowed to have seven diplomats, 25 technical personnel and 19 locally-hired employees."
