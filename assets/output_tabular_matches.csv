Despite Russia's repeated statements that the Crimean referendum on secession was in line with the international law and the UN Charter and in conformity with the precedent set by Kosovo's secession from Serbia in 2008, the west and Kiev have refused to recognize the legality of Crimea's reunification with Russia.27",IR

Turkmenistan is the single major source of natural gas that can help keep the supply sufficient for European markets.While the mutually converging interests for exports and imports seem to bind these two countries together, there are tensions .6 However, frequent price disputes and the vulnerability Turkmenistan faces regarding the potential manipulation of its pipeline monopoly by Russia make the diversification of gas pipelines a desirable energy strategy for Turkmen leaders. Recent losses suffered due to a stoppage of exports to Russia in 2009 meant that its gas production fell to 38 bcm from 70.5 bcm the previous year. This stoppage translated into a one-quarter drop in Turkmenistan's gross domestic product . Events such as theApril 9, 2009, pipeline explosion near the Turkmen-Uzbek border demonstrate the tensions. In that case, Turkmenistan accused Gazprom of deliberately arranging the explosion. Russia attempted to leverage Turkmenistan either to reduce the price or the volume of gas or a combination of both prior to resuming the gas flow . This is an example of complex interdependence in that Russia's role as the primary importer of Turkmen gas has actually given Turkmenistan some leverage.",IR

After a telephone conversation with Putin, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said in apparent disbelief that he was living ""in another world."" The former American president, Bill Clinton, provided clarification of what world that was, suggesting that Putin wanted to re-establish Russian greatness in nineteenth-century terms. Prime Minister Arsenii Yatseniuk of Ukraine repeatedly accused Putin of wanting to restore the Soviet Union. The Russian president denied the charges, stating that he was not trying to bring back either the empire or the USSR. Technically, he was right. During the past decade, Russia has been waging open and hybrid wars, annexing territories, and using its virtual monopoly on energy supplies to the countries of Eastern Europe as a weapon, the object being to establish a much less costly and more flexible system of political control over post-Soviet space than was available either to the Russian Empire or to the Soviet Union. Yet many policies of the present-day Russian leadership have their origins in the last years and months of the existence of the USSR. 2",IR

e9d5dbc714f74e8290e919b13344aaa5,turkey accuse russia,"Last week, tempers flared anew between Ankara and Moscow after Turkey accused Russia of violating its airspace near the Syrian border.","Courtesy of ZeroHedge . View original post here. Submitted by Tyler Durden. Last week, tempers flared anew between Ankara and Moscow after Turkey accused Russia of violating its airspace near the Syrian border. This time around, Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador - a much more prudent course of action than shooting down a Russian warplane, which is what Ankara decided to do back in November. Of course every geopolitical action has an equal and opposite reaction. Russia's response to the downing of its Su-24 by Turkish F-16s was to tarnish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's international image by linking his government to Islamic State's illicit crude trade. The Kremlin's anti-Erdogan PR campaign came complete with dozens of videos depicting oil tankers barreling across Turkey's border with Syria unimpeded and the Russian Defense Ministry delighted in broadcasting footage of airstrikes that turned hundreds of the tankers to dust. Now, Russia is hitting back at Turkey after the latest spat over Moscow's alleged incursion into Ankara's airspace and once again, The Kremlin is breaking out the videos. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Turkey is shelling civilian areas in Syria from a border outpost. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov showed video footage depicting the attacks at a press conference. ""This facility is a Turkish border outpost, which did not have any firing points a few months ago,"" he said, adding that "" This is called fact. This is irrefutable proof that the Turkish Armed Forces are shelling settlements on the Syrian border from heavy artillery systems. ""Play Video So why is Turkey shelling Syria you ask? Well that's an open question but there are two rather obvious possibilities. First, Ankara could be hitting the YPG, who Erdogan deeply distrusts and equates with the PKK. It's also possible Turkey is attempting to assist the opposition as Russia and Iran bear down on the rebels and militants. Sputnik said on Monday that one Syrian soldier was killed in shelling from Turkey in norther Latakia. ""At present, it is the region where the Syrian Armed Forces are carrying out an offensive against the Nusra Front militants and a number of other extremists,"" Sputnik notes. ""The jihadists aim to establish full control over the Turkish border, through which they regularly receive reinforcements such as equipment and fighters."" So Turkey, it would appear, is now actively involved in the ground battle - on the side of the terrorists. "" We expect an immediate reaction and explanations of the actions of Turkish military by NATO and the Pentagon ,"" Gen. Konashenkov says.",IIR

Primakov's statements-that Russia need not fear a ""color revolution,"" that the Donbas should be recognized as Ukrainian territory, and that Russian troops should never be sent to help rebel militias there-indeed implied that Ukraine was far from the worst security problem facing Russia.3 In other words, the most critical set of foreign policy decisions undertaken by Putin since entering the presidency in 2000-those surrounding military actions toward Ukraine-do not appear to have been due to Primakov's influence. They instead have more than a whiff of Duginism about them.",IIR

Unsurprisingly, the explanation comes from the Russian president himself and was actually offered over 3 years ago. As expected, the Western corporate media and the Obama administration chose to ignore Vladimir Putin's explanation for Russia's stance on Syria and continued a number of policies that have completely exacerbated the conflict. In a live interview with RT in June 2013, Putin was asked for an explanation regarding Russia's support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, even though this support has made some people very angry at Russia. Putin's response was that Russia does not support the Assad government or Assad himself, but before defining Russia's official position, he explained what Russia does not want to do within Syria or across the Middle East: However, according to Putin, what worries Russia can be identified by having a look "" at what is going on in the Middle East in general ."" In Putin's eyes, these events are no accident. As he puts it, these events happened for a reason: "" Some people, from the outside, think that if they can 'comb' the region to how they see fit - some of them call this 'democracy' - then the region will come into calmness and order. That's not how it is. Without taking into account the history, the traditions, religious particularities, you must not do anything in the Middle East, especially as an outsider."" Play Video Russia found this out the hard way when its military intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s, a war many historians believe to be one of the main reasons for the fall of the Soviet empire. According to Robert Gates, director of the CIA under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and Secretary of Defense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the U.S. began arming and funding jihadists in Pakistan and Afghanistan six months prior to the Soviet invasion with the express goal of luring the Soviets into a quagmire. Similarly, and not by accident, the tactic used to draw Russia into Afghanistan is the same tactic being used today in Syria. In fact, Obama warned Putin that Russia's adventures into Syria would result in the same quagmire the Soviets met in Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly, supporting radical militant groups to overthrow regimes in the Middle East has been a key hallmark of Obama's foreign policy. As Putin notes: ""So they interfered in the internal affairs of Libya. Whether the regime was good or bad - but Libya used to have the highest standard of living in the Middle East. And what's happening there now? There's a war for resources; an endless inter-tribal war. How is this all going to end - nobody knows."" What happened to Libya resonated strongly with Russia due to the fact that in that situation, the West convinced Russia and China not to use their veto power at the U.N. Security Council level -- they were told regime change was not part of NATO's agenda in Libya. As it turned out, however, this was one of the first things that happened as soon as authorization was granted for NATO to bomb Libyan territory. Putin immediately questioned why NATO was attacking Muammar Gaddafi directly despite their promises they would not do so. Putin has therefore drawn the following conclusion: The role of al-Nusra in the Syrian conflict continues to be the main issue today, as Russia has repeatedly asked for the United States to differentiate between terrorist groups and moderate groups on the ground in Syria. As Putin said: ""Or, here's another example. They support certain organizations that are fighting against Assad in Syria, yet those same countries fight against these organizations in Mali."" Putin's reference to fighters in Mali is a direct attack on France's role in the war on terror. France has been actively bombing Mali since 2013, though this is rarely covered by the mainstream media. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has noted, the fighters France supported in Libya to overthrow Gaddafi were the same fighters they have supposedly been fighting in Mali. "" Often, not only are they the same organizations - they are the same individuals ,"" Putin added. ""They simply leave Syria and go to fight in Mali - where western states do not support them. Then the same people go back to Syria and there they are supported.""",IIR
21c56c6727554e7eb9c9dbae1ad61acf,turkey accuse russia,"According to Moscow it was a provocation, and Turkey had earlier accused Russia of the same .","It might be considered that the century-spanning mutual relations between Turkey and Russia usually have not been the easiest. Longer periods of cooperation and peace between the two nations have been extremely rare. The reason for that was the incessant rivalry between the two powers for areas of influence in South East Europe and Central Asia. The state of affairs was further complicated by fundamental religious differences between Turkey and Russia. Turkey, then still known as the Ottoman Empire, aimed at supremacy of all Muslims. Moscow, on the other hand, aspired to become the centre of Easter Christian tradition. After the Turks captured Constantinople , Moscow wanted to gain importance as the only successor of the Byzantine Empire. This ambition was emphasised by the marriage concluded in 1472 by Ivan III the Great with Sophia Paleologue , niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantin XI Dragases . An event of great symbolic importance was assuming the double-headed Byzantine eagle as the coat-of-arms of the entire Ruthenian country and introducing etiquette taken directly from Eastern Roman Empire at the court of the tsars. Following the fall of the First Rome in the West , and the fall of Byzantium in the East almost one thousand years later, Moscow was supposed to become the Third Rome . In turn, after seizing Constantinople Turkish rulers initially assumed the title of ""Roman Emperor"". Closer to the end of the Ottoman Empire, however, they preferred to add the title of Caliphs - Muhammad's successors - to that of sultan. Nowadays, leaders of both countries, not without a reason, are often compared to those rulers. The press often calls the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, the new tsar. The President of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is just as frequently referred to as the contemporary sultan. Such comparisons serve very well to illustrate political ambitions and enormous power wielded by both leaders as of now. As their main goal, both Putin a nd Erdogan committed themselves to reclaiming power in the traditional areas of influence and earning respect for their countries internationally. In both one and the other country, the actions of the presidents won them tens of millions of zealous followers and uncritical support of the majority of the society. Yet again, just as many times in the past, this led to a conflict of interests between Ankara and Moscow. The ever-present animosity has been growing in the past few years due to the dramatic events in the Middle East and the former Soviet republics in the Caucasus. The already very strained situation culminated on 24 November 2015, when a Russian Su-24 bomber was shot down on its way back from a mission against ISIS by a Turkish F-16 fighter. According to official Turkish sources, the reason for the shootdown was the Russian aircraft violating the airspace of the Republic of Turkey near the Syrian border . Pierre Sprey, American defence specialist and a former Pentagon employee, claimed in an interview for the American Harper's Magazine that: ""the evidence looks pretty strong that the Turks were setting up an ambush"". Soon, more incidents involving Russia and Turkey followed. In early December 2015, Turkey reacted strongly to the fact that a serviceman on the deck of a Russian warship passing through Bosporus was seen holding a rocket launcher. A few days later, on the Aegean Sea, a Russian ship fired warning shots at an approaching Turkish fishing boat, which allegedly did not react to calls to divert its course. According to Moscow it was a provocation, and Turkey had earlier accused Russia of the same . The escalation of adversary acts posed a threat mainly due to the fact that Turkey is one of main pillars of NATO, and Russia is a global military power with nuclear weapons. Both countries were at the verge of an open armed conflict with unpredictable potential effects on a global scale. After several months of mutual aggression in the media, there was a sudden and completely unforeseen turn in the relations between the two countries. In August 2016, Recep Tayyip Erdogan came with an unexpected visit to Russia. Meeting of the Presidents of Russia and Turkey in the Constantine Palace in Strelna near Saint Petersburg The Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the visit of the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Russia indicated both leaders' willingness to: ""resume the dialogue and relations between Russia and Turkey"" after nine months of diplomatic crisis. Turkish press provided more details, reporting that reconciliation with Russia was possible thanks to previous secret negotiations at the highest level in Tashkent. Erdogan, on the other hand, announced that collaboration with Russia would help solving problems in the region. According to the Turkish President, actions taken together with Russia would lead to a new chapter in the relations between Ankara and Moscow, completely different than ever before. Additionally, President Erdogan officially apologised to Russia and to the family of the killed Su-24 pilot. Russia's answer was to lift all its sanctions against Turkey . A few days after the meeting, separatists in Donbass resumed their aggressive military campaign against Ukraine, whereas Turkish forces entered northern Syria and opened intensive fire at positions held by the Islamic State. Judging from these events, one may conclude that the arrangements made in Saint Petersburg had a much broader scope than what was officially announced in communications of both parties to the negotiations. It can be assumed that the two powers have now moved on to definitive solutions in issues relevant to them, under secret agreements concluded in August 2016.",IIR

Russia has always struggled to be acknowledged as an equal by the West, whether it was the British Empire, France, or Germany. The sentiment is the same, but the object of Russia's obsession has changed. Laqueur notes, ""America, and only to a lesser extent Europe, are Russia's enemies, eager to hurt the motherland in every possible way."" In the nineteenth century, anti-Westernism was cultural; under the Soviets, it was ideological; and now Laqueur accuses Putin of intellectual laziness for adapting old ideas to the present day. Laqueur seems to think that there is no legitimate reason to be fearful of the West, that Putin is whipping up fear and anti-Western sentiment because it plays well domestically. Put another way, anti-Westernism is the means to an end, the vehicle by which Putin advances his personal power interests. Laqueur's view undervalues, or flatly ignores, the possibility that the West's actions--notably the expansion of NATO--have contributed to shaping Putin's narrative about Russian identity and its place in the international system. It is misguided to discount the claims Putin makes about the vulnerability Russia feels in relation to the West simply because Putin's style of domestic governance is one that Western leaders abhor. Not trusting Putin is one thing; but this is not sufficient reason to ignore the growing nationalism that underscores Putin's motives for Russia's actions in Ukraine. The West has been ""writing off"" Russia's concerns since the end of the Cold War, arguably not to a productive end. Putin is motivated by more than his statist tendencies or his personal interest in power. There is more to Russia's motivations than Western analysts seem prepared to acknowledge. There is tremendous power in ideas; as Putin's ideational narrative about Russian exceptionalism takes hold, it must be better understood. We underestimate him at our own peril.",IIR

Conceptual framework: Unintended Consequences in Context of Realism Paradigm Different states adopt policies in international arena to address their basic strategic and economic needs. The policies vary as per the geostrategic make-up of that particular region where the state's self-interests are supposed to dwell. The actions by states to achieve their self-interests defines the rational foreign policy goals, which in other way sometimes couples with the irrational outcomes. Such irrational and unidentified outcomes as a result of the rational and defined actions are termed as the unintended consequences. Now, the questionarises what are unintended consequences? Phenomenologically, an American Sociologist, Robert K. Merton firstly used the term of unintended consequences in 1936 in his book On Social Structure and Science. According to his narrative, the unintended consequences are the unforeseen results due to actor's determined and rational actions. He further explains that the unintended consequence is a sociallyconstructed concept which is indeed a relationship between action and latent existing but not yet developed function . This relationship determines the reaction as well as re-actions. Simply, they are unidentified results which are unavoidable . Vernon defines that ""Unintended consequences may arise as the cumulative outcome of similar actions performed simultaneously or consecutively by a number of actors"" . He explains the phenomenon of ""unintended consequences"" in political theory. Moreover, Karapin explains this concept in the following words; ""Unintended consequences abound in politics and policy making due to the complexity of political and social life, and the incalculability of the strategic interactions that may emerge when a political actor tries to achieve a result. No agent has complete control in the messy realm of human affairs. No campaign, edict decision, or legislation can seamlessly produce its desired outcome, because every enactment engages a field of subjects with their own intentions, desires, purposes and strategies. Policies may trigger resistance or compensatory behavior."" In the context of International Relations, the unintended consequences approach come up to the regional and international actors which are influenced by the realist paradigm that shapes the reactionary approach of a particular action. It is actually a relation between an action and its reaction which further defines the scope of that action against the unwanted outcome. Generally speaking, the unintended consequences are figured more consistently as the undesired outcomes. But this statement can be disqualified by the fact that scope of the unintended consequences can only be defined after analyzing the rational and intended objectives of the foreign policy of an actor concerned. As it can be defined in terms of action and reaction with both positive and negative outcomes depending upon the intended desires of an actor. Therefore, it is argued that not all unintended consequences are undesirable, or in other words the unintended outcomes may add to the intended goals described in the rationally defined foreign policy objectives of a state. Studying unintended consequences is a futile effort unless the broad-based causes of such consequence are ascertained. As mentioned above that unintended consequences is a relationship between a rational action and a latent function that eventually shape the nature of possible unintended outcomes. For causes of such consequences, Merton has described two causing variables: 1) intentions exhibited by human beings, which drags in the classical-realism in the concept of unintended consequences, and; 2) System or circumstances, where the rational actions are employed in pursuit of the desired result as per the Waltz's system theory. The human behavior influences the nature of unintended consequences by resorting to rational actions that ultimately results in the outcomes that may be irrational or in contradiction to the wanted outcomes of the actor. Vernon has extended the phenomenon of variables for the changing nature of unintended consequences and defined two variables: variety of terms and diversity in context. The changing human behavior triggers the diverse system or environment to change and produce unwanted outcomes. Such a case would qualify the approach of Vernon that human behavior is independent and causes the entire context to change. For example invasions in Afghanistan by the USSR and later by the US were a rational approach held by the foreign policies of both superpowers in pursuit of some limited desired outcomes. Here the states acted in a region with a diversity of other states that enabled the rational actions to result in the delivery of unintended consequences. The motive behind foreign intervention in Afghanistan was limited to certain economic and strategic objectives in Central and South Asia. But it also resulted in some grave and long-term unintended consequences for the region including the proxy war between Pakistan and India, which proved to be unintended and unwanted outcomes of the rational approach of the foreign intervention in Afghanistan. The unintended consequences of the foreign interventions in Afghanistan Geopolitically and historically, Afghanistan has been critically located at the crossroads of South and Central Asia and the Middle East. In the early twentieth century, the renowned Indian poet, Mohammad Iqbal, portrayed Afghanistan as ""the Heart of Asia,"" while British India's Viceroy, Lord Curzon , called this land ""the Cockpit of Asia"" . Moreover, Vogelsang states that Afghanistan is considered the ""Crossroads of Civilizations"" through which warriors and traders from surrounding areas - Central Asia , the Middle East , the Indian subcontinent, Siberia and the Ottoman - took this passage to their destinations for gaining wealth and prestige mainly through bloody looting . Further, Tanner has marked Afghanistan ""Crossroad of Empires"", but during the Ahmad Shah Durrani's period, the neighboring people were fearsome from the Afghans because a vast Afghan empire emerged. Afghanistan has been blocked and remained in isolation from the other empires' influences until the new empires of Britain and Russia emerged. Therefore, Afghanistan has hosted several overtly-and-covertlyheld geostrategic competitions and remained a constant target of the unwelcomed drawbacks of the intentional policy actions of the old Great Game players adopted by Russia and Britain throughout this classical geopolitical rivalry. The irrational consequences of continued great game politics created a security dilemma in Afghanistan even in the 20th and 21st centuries. Afghan land had been a cockpit which has been witnessing permanent power jockeying and destruction due to wars or war-like conditions . While, Afghanistan's history is critically analyzed after studying the historical archives, the three defined eras of foreign interventions are obvious which contributed a lot in the political and socio-economic destruction of Afghanistan as a country: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan of 1979; postCold War era when the regional players Pakistan and India got involved in Afghanistan; and US invasion of Afghanistan of 9/11 incident. The critical content analysis of Afghanistan's history during the aforesaid time-periods comparatively helps to untie a lot of endless unintended consequences, which directly affected the regional security and geopolitical dynamics that directly or indirectly put serious and grave undesired impacts on South Asian region as well. The factual study of these highlighted historical events and developments show that states executes their rationally oriented foreign policies to attain some defined objectives, which as per the law of unintended consequences, turns out with some undesired outcomes. To counter such undesired results, state resorts to irrational means and so forth. For example, the natural engagement of Islamabad in favor of the US in 1980s was meant to contain the Soviet expansionism, but such an engagement triggered India to exploit anarchic disorder in Afghanistan for her own designs against Pakistan. Such a reactionary approach of India was balanced by a counter-reactionary approach by Pakistan and paved a way for a full scale proxy conflict between Pakistan and India. 1. Growth of opium poppy by taliban's regime A direct Soviet intervention in Afghanistan triggered the United States , in the 1980s, to fight a decade-long war in Afghanistan by arming and financing the mujahedeen forces. The US poured billions of dollars into the war and was successful in driving the Soviets out of the country. The monetary support provided by the Central Investigation Agency was in billions and thus, the insurgent groups in Afghanistan had to get heavy funds for their fight against the Soviet Union. The ""secret war"" in Afghanistan was heavily funded by the United States, but the irony is that the official funds provided by the CIA through the Pakistan's intelligence agency named Inter-Services Intelligence to the mujahedeen were only 10% of the total cost of the ""Afghan War"" . The former Afghan President Barbak Karmal highlighted the elements which funded and trained these forces in Afghanistan and made destructions by this war to the country at large, in his interview to an Egyptian journalist. Here, a following excerpt has been taken from primary sources. The United States has provided the counter-revolutionary elements with more than $1 billion in order to kill the Afghans and destroy the country. This year alone the U.S. Congress allocated $480 million to fiance the ""undeclared"" war against us. The amount of aid the United States has given to the counter-revolutionary elements is more than 6 times the amount it gave to Afghanistan as aid in 20 years before the revolution. The other countries such as West Germany, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia, Britain and France gave financial aid to the tune of $800 million . The question is where that 90% of the cost of the Afghan War did come for fighting the Soviets. The answer is obviously hidden in the Afghan War that is presented through the lenses of the production of Opium Poppy on the arable land of Afghanistan. The mujahedeen forces used an extensive amount of money earned by the Opium economy of Afghanistan to afford that decade-long unprecedented effort against the Red Army . Finally, the war ended with the withdrawal of the Red Army; but unfortunately, the tradition of using Opium Poppy and then heroin as a source of fueling insurgencies continued. The cultivation of Opium Poppy as a main crop in Afghanistan was resulted when the refugees returned to their homeland and saw their fields with crops which were destroyed by the Soviet forces previously in the 1980s and thus, preferred to grow Opium as their main source of income . Takeover of the Taliban of major parts of Afghanistan including Kabul boosted their influence allover in Afghanistan. They imposed strict Islamic Laws in the country, which enforced their main objective of making Afghanistan a purely Islamic Emirate. Initially, the Taliban were reluctant by their Islamic ideology perspectives to allow any kind of Opium growth and trade. However, after gaining power and coming to know the geopolitical and strategic realities concerning their conflicts with different groups and funding for these conflicts, they had to turn towards Opium and make the Opiate economy of Afghanistan as their perfect source of funding for their military equipment and other necessary things to make their movement survive . There were two main things that turned the Taliban towards cultivation of Islamic banned Opium and their trade: Since, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the only countries that provided them with funds and other military support , but that support was insufficient in confronting the Northern Alliance – heavily funded by Russia, Iran and India. Hence, the first motive behind supporting Opiate was to fulfill their monetary needs which would allow the Taliban to arm their fighters with modern arms and ammunitions. The Taliban were facing trouble from the local warlords and to earn their support, the Taliban had to allow the Opiate trade by the warlords who handed their arms to the Taliban in exchange for the cultivation of Opiate . The Opiate economy, however, benefited both the Taliban and the opposing groups such as the Northern Alliance, since they both needed to fund their militancy. The Taliban, however, were the most benefited group in Afghanistan from the heroin and Opiate business with most of the production coming out of the Taliban controlled areas as reported by the US and the UNDCP in 1997 with almost 96 percent of heroin yielded by the Taliban held areas . The Taliban have avoided any public announcement of Opiate being allowed in Afghanistan during their rule from 1996 to 2001. Even though, they strongly criticized the Opium cultivation and growth by the farmers and warlords, and even hinted at strong punishment for the violator of what they call as the decree of Islam and the Holy Quran. The Taliban Foreign Ministry stated on September 10, 1997, that ""The Islamic State of Afghanistan informs all compatriots that, as the use of heroin and hashish are not permitted in Islam; they are reminded once again that they should strictly refrain from growing, using, and trading in hashish and heroin. Anyone who violates this order shall be meted out a punishment in line with the lofty Mohammad and Sharia law and thus shall not be entitled to launch a complaint"" . Since, their takeover of Kabul, the Taliban were facing a serious problem of the international isolation which they tried to acquire at any cost. They tried relentlessly to make their ally Pakistan convinced the international community in granting recognition to the Taliban regime, especially from the US. In an attempt to get a recognition from the United States and the United Nations, the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, in an appeasing move banned all kinds of Opium trade and production in 2001, which caused a decrease in Opium production from 82,000 hectares in 2000 to just 7,600 hectares in 2001 . In other words, the Opium production was declined by more than 90 percent. Most of the Opium production during the ban by the Taliban belonged to the areas held by the Northern Alliance which accounted 83% of the total Opium production. However, the US military campaign against the Taliban regime in the late 2001 caused an extensive surge in Opium production and allowed the farmers to cultivate the once banned Opium Poppy in Afghanistan. The immense increase in cultivation of Opium Poppy and the heroin trade across the region once again touched the sky. It did not only affect the regional neighboring countries including Pakistan, but also caused an increment in the heroin usage in the West in general and the US in particular. The number of heroin users in the US itself increased from 189,000 to almost 4.5 million in 2016 which had dramatically changed thedrug absorption throughout the US-led international invasion since 2001 . Thus, the Opium phenomenon added to one of the most important and unnoticed unintended consequences of the rational approach of global engagement in Afghanistan and reassertion of the global powers militaryinterventionism. However, they didn't liberate the Afghans and pushed them socially in the darkness of ignorance. 2. Plantation of terrorism, al-qaeda and global jihad: the usliberal interventionism One of the highly regarded unintended consequences after the Soviets' withdrawal was the establishment of a new set of terrorism in the form of Al-Qaeda. Once the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton confessed for the first time about the US responsibility for generation of mujahedeen against Communism and continuous support to the Taliban in NGG, when she admitted to ABC TV on November 12, 2010 that: ""Part of what we are fighting against right now, the United States created. We created the Mujahidin force against the Soviet Union . We trained them, we equipped them, we funded them, including somebody named Osama bin Laden.... And it didn't work out so well for us"" . The story begins when the mujahedeen fought a successful holy war against the Soviets with the US backing and rigidly repulsed their occupation. They included a considerable number of the Arab fighters who joined the Afghan counterparts in this war. One of such fighters was Osama bin Laden, who had travelled all the way to Afghanistan from his home town in Saudi Arabia to assist his Afghan colleagues. He was initially introduced by the head of the Saudi's Intelligence, Prince Turki Bin Faisal in 1980 , to assist the mujahedeen in their fight against the Soviet Union. He did a major part in defeating the Red Army, since he invested his expertise in managing the mujahedeen affairs and received funds from the Saudi government until the Soviets were back to their country in the late 1989. With funds from his family's billion dollar construction business, bin Laden dug caves and deep tunnel complexes in the mountains of Afghanistan, specifically in Khost and Jalalabad. With setting up highly advance depots and complexes for the Afghan War fighters, he also started setting up a separate training camp for the Arab-Afghan mujahedeen fighters which hinted at the formation of a new organization for the Global Jihad . The whole story, from Saudi Arabia to Global Jihad, has been described by Bin Laden himself, he said; ""To counter these atheist Russians, the Saudis chose me as their representative in Afghanistan. I settled in Pakistan in Afghan border region. There I received volunteers who came from the Saudi Kingdom and from all over the Arab and Muslim countries. I set up my first camp where these volunteers were trained by Pakistani and American officers. The weapons were supplied by the Americans, the money from the Saudis. I discovered that it was not enough to fight in Afghanistan , but that we had to fight on all fronts, communist or Western oppression"" . In August 1988, after assisting the Afghan mujahedeen against the Soviets, bin Laden huddled up various extremist groups including both Arab and Afghan mujahedeen, which resulted in the emergence of an idea of the Global Jihad and a platform to converge Jihad fighters in the name of ""Al-Qaeda"" . This group then moved to Sudan in early 1990s and established contacts with some potentially capable terrorist organizations across the Middle East and North Africa assembling thousands of radicals and extremist figures. After takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in late 1996, bin Laden founded the same shelter again, which he left following the departure of the Soviets. The Al-Qaeda started operations under the manifesto of the Global Jihad and carried out some vicious attacks in the world including the deadly attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 . The terrorism of AlQaeda never stopped and enforced the capability of their fighters, which led to the attacks on Twin Towers, the deadliest in the US history by September 11, 2001. a. US liberal interventionism or great power military interventionism As stated by professor of International Islamic University Islamabad during his interview, ""any superpower or major power tries to create reasons in order to have its own excuse for intervention for a specific matter. Today, it is named as liberal interventionism such as Operation Endurance was launched by the US administration in light of Global War on Terror for liberating Afghanistan from terrorists and Iraq from the WMDs. It is not the people of that concerned country liberating from the tyrant regime, but the matter of fact is that that particular rational action is actually maximization of power that is done to serve the interests of that power intervened"" . The rational approach of Bush's GWOT policy shifted unlawful great power's military intervention adventurism to lawful long-term counter-terrorism policy under the US grand strategy agenda for Afghanistan and South Asia. The emergence of the terrorist organization of Al-Qaeda was nothing but a perverse outcome of the foreign intervention and misadventures of the superpowers that started in late 1970s with the invasion of Afghanistan by the communist USSR and anti-communist measures by the US and its allies. The destruction of Afghanistan and international community went on, even after the horrific attacks on the US, and the Global War on Terror as one of the unintended consequences of the foreign intervention still exist to absorb the rest of global peace and stability and is operating with the same label of Al-Qaeda in various parts of the Middle East and Africa. The emergence of Al-Qaeda did not only lead to the destabilization of Afghanistan but also changed the geopolitical dynamics and security patterns of the entire region. Afghanistan was again chosen as the main base for what their founders have asserted as the Global Jihad and thus, made Afghanistan a focal point for the War against the international terrorism. Pakistan was again a frontline ally to fight this war, initiated in the beginning of twenty-first century. Pakistan affected directly from superpower's interventionism in the name of GWOT and ""so-called"" global Jihad . Buzan and Wæver perfectly portray the picture of this great power or superpower interventionism after 9/11 in these following words: ""Almost nobody disputes that the end of the Cold War had a profound impact on the whole pattern of international security but, more than a decade after the transition, the character of the post-Cold War security order still remains hotly contested...since decolonization, the regional level of security has become both more autonomous and more prominent in international politics, and that the ending of the Cold War accelerated this process. Cold War, both the remaining superpower and the other great powers had less incentive, and displayed less will, to intervene in security affairs outside their own regions. The terrorist attack on the United States in 2001 may well trigger some reassertion of great power interventionism"" . According to Pakistani analysts, holistically, the US take excuses in the garb of liberal interventionalist approach to reach any country where there is instability . For example in Iraq, there was internal striving between Saddam and the rest forces. But after the US intervention for liberating the Iraqi people from Saddam, it could not have paved the grounds for peace. In fact, Iraq was in a peaceful situation during Saddam's era and today it is practically fragmented and unstable. Another example is Afghanistan. ""In Afghanistan, the US doesn't want to stay anymore, but it is not eliminating its full presence becauseit doesn't want to give space to Russia and China. With the name of liberation, the US has only deceived Afghanis and they are not dear to the US as well. Merely the country's interests are dear to the US. The US intervention has undone the nationalcharacter of Afghanistan"" . 3. Re-conceptualization of the great game notion into new idea of the grand great game The Great Game concept is very well-known. But there is a long history in construction of any idea. The Grand Great Game or the 3G idea has been constructed and re-conceptualized in light of geopolitical dynamics and security patterns emerged in the post-9/11 era, since the term New Great Game was coined after the disintegration of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. A Pakistani professor Azmat Hayat Khan quoted Major Hoggerty that the old great game is defined as ""the struggle between Great Britain and Russia, to gain influence in Afghanistan was known as the great game"" . The OGG geopolitics was different from the New Great Game on the following points: The OGG was only between two powers, Great Britain and Czarist Russia, whereas the NGG has more than six players, Russia, US, India, Pakistan, China and Iran. There was no economy or religion involved in the old Great Game, whereas, now it is all dominated by economic interests and religion. In OGG, Afghanistan was used as a buffer to block hostile influence, where as of now, in the NGG it is being used as a jumping pad to achieve their objectives . In the OGG, Great Britain and Russia had an understanding that Russia would not interfere south of Hindu-Kush in Afghanistan, and Britain would not interfere north of Hindu-Kush. After 9/11, when the US invaded Afghanistan, it made the matter more complicated and grandeur, and has made it very hard for the regional countries, to come to some understanding. They neither the US nor do other regional countries trust each other and under these circumstances, there can be no peace in Afghanistan. Therefore, this 3G idea was approved by the most of research participants, since a sample size of 15 research respondents has been chosen for conducting interviews from senior and junior university doctorate professors, public-sector professionals, media persons, and doctorate scholars of International Relations from Pakistan, India, United States, Estonia, Australia, Singapore, Afghanistan and Iran . Few examples with comments of these participants are as follows a senior Professor expressed his views during interview to the author that ""Using the term Great Game is a bit misleading because apart from the fact that today's inter-state competition is taking place in the same geographic neighborhood as the original GG, there is very little similarity. Having said that, you could of course use your 3G nomenclature but you would need to explain right from the beginning the differences and the similarities with the original term . The renowned Afghanistan-Pakistan expert, Marvin G. Weinbaum reflected that ""Let it suffice to say that what these games have most in common is that Afghanistan serves as the focal point of larger regional contestations, all carrying lasting consequences for Afghanistan itself. In contrast to the Great Game and Cold War, rather than its being a competition essentially between two major antagonists, the new game encompasses multiple actors including, importantly, non-state ones. The 9/11 brought these non-state actors clearly to the forefront. Moreover, the current game, with its strategic economic and ideological dimensions does not fit easily into traditional realpolitik thinking. That said, the ""game"" metaphor may have lost its utility. The devising of term grand great game would not be inappropriate if in well defining it you have justified its use"" . Today's chess game is created neither for having the direct globe-spanning empire building nor keeping the contending chess players in balance . Rather, the master of this game has tried to buy political influence indirectly by devising new strategies, new tactics and new game rules to content with new players, such as the sole superpower with allies has moved towards gaining the direct influence in Afghanistan in disguise of countering the global challenge of terrorism under the long-term grand strategy of the GWOT. This point is truly expressed by Rubin and Rashid . ""The Great Game is no fun anymore. The term ""Great Game"" was used by nineteenth-century British imperialists to describe the British Russian struggle for position on the chessboard of Afghanistan and Central Asia, a contest with a few players, mostly limited to intelligence forays and short wars fought on horseback with rifles, and with those living on the chessboard largely bystanders or victims. More than a century later, the game continues. But now, the number of players has exploded, those living on the chessboard have become involved, and the intensity of the violence and the threats it produces affect the entire globe. The Great Game can no longer be treated as a sporting event for distant spectators. It is time to agree on some new rules."" Another senior Pakistani expert also is in favor of the reconstruction of new idea in the following words; As the geo-politics of the region has changed mostly after 9/11 and new players have entered the game, the word ""Grand Great Game"" would be appropriate. This is how political words develop with changing time and geopolitics. International politics before and after 9/11 will never be the same. Apart from politics and economics, religion has entered into international politics and in some areas, it is playing the dominant role and it is connected to each other all over the world e.g. Africa, Afghanistan and Syria etc. Times have changed, players have changed; but the methods, tactics and strategies are the same. Addition of this word grand great game would be a big boost to Political Science terminologies and once you write it would be quoted by others and this would pave the way for further research and studies"" . Another senior Pakistani analyst slightly differs with the aforementioned viewpoint that this great game geopolitics is continued with new character and new interests of new players. The nomenclature of the OGG and NGG can be changed, but definitely impact would be the same that is power politics"" . Another practitioner articulated in this way. ""During the Cold War, in the same battle ground, United States replaced British and the aim was twofold: US wanted its revenge from USSR for its failing in Vietnam and at the same time, US was denying the USSR, an access to warm waters of Indian Ocean. Now the battle ground is same. More players have joined i.e. China and India, in addition to existing players. U.S. and India also want to extend the battle ground to Pakistan. The term should be changed and have correctly been called it the ""grand game"". I fully agree with you."" . Similarly, a senior Indian professor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University gives their support to this idea. For example, ""the Grand Great Game is more appropriate as it is different as the Great Game involved UK and then USA in the Cold War and focused mostly on the USSR. The 3G not only involves Russia, Central Asian states plus, China, India, Iran and others"" . Another senior Indian professor maintained that ""As regards content of conflict, then it was for imperial and ideological pursuits and now it is for geo-economic gains, controlling trade and energy corridors besides worth the $trillion untapped mineral resources of Afghanistan. South Asian geography is, therefore, impacting the regional politics and international relations, since major competing players of the present ""Great Game"" are international, whereas India, Pakistan and Iran are the peripheral ones. [No issue in using the word ""Great Game"" as it points to the clash on interest. Nevertheless scholars must have used it for explanation in relation to the old great game"" . According to the perspective of Iranian participant, ""Today, there is also a great game in the form of a game for power. The issues of terrorism and extremism, Al-Qaeda, Taliban and ISIS, as well as the rise of India and China as two major powers, are among the issues that have affected the security scenario in the region. Afghanistan has been the arena for proxy wars between various countries, including Russia-the United States and India – Pakistan and etc., to reduce their rival's influence. And now the great game between Russia, China and Pakistan on the one side and the United States and India on the other hand are strengthening"" . Unlikely, Afghan participant goes into detail that first of all, some of the actors have switched and some new actors have entered the scene. Afghanistan was a buffer state during the old great game. But during part of the Cold War and what some call now new great game, Afghanistan is one of the focal points. The main axis of the Cold War and the new great game are the same - Russia - but their allies have switched or seemed to be in a state of switching sides. Pakistan, for example, is entering or posing to be entering the Russian-led camp. In the existing situation, the geostrategic interests, more than anything else, are driving the agendas of different countries and so far as the Af-Pak region is concerned, the situation is getting complex with the active involvement of India-Pakistan rivalries more than any time before, US-Iran trouble, Iran-Saudi rivalry, and the active quest for hegemony by the United States and Russia and somewhat silent, but overt struggle by China. It is not going to go away any time soon. ""I would prefer call it new Great Game than Grand Great Game"" . Unintended consequences of the 3G A Professor of John Hopkins University explained that ""I think that the term Great Game has some merit, insofar as it suggests that there is a complex rivalry playing out among major powers in Eurasia, with Afghanistan as a central theatre of that competition. Afghanistan is not, however, currently the object of the competition in a serious way. No country wants to control Afghanistan or seeks a permanent presence there. The investment by the US and NATO has been driven by counterterrorism concerns, and the behavior by other countries has largely been a reaction to that US/NATO presence"" . Yet, the consequences of this 3G struggle are clearly seen. ""The notion of a single chess player is equally false, especially in Central Asia, where dominant states and local states are all alike weak"" , because ""the emergent new structure of international security is 1 + 4 + regions"" , including the US (the international superpower, 4 rising powers and other different regional players. Therefore, Nye describe that ""the world politics today is like three-dimensional chess game. At the top level, military power among states is unipolar, but at the middle level, of interstate economic relations, the world is multipolar and has been so far more than that a decade. At the bottom level of transnational relations . Power is chaotically distributed and diffused to non-state actors"" . Moreover, the trend of confrontation and cooperation in the 3G under the umbrella of grand strategic partnerships are continued. On the one hand, states' strategic interests have a collision with the others, but also they are collaborating for humanitarian assistance, countering terrorism and peacemaking, which provide the imperial states an opportunity to manipulate the weak ones. Or, they use the geography of the latter for their geopolitical interests against their rival. Moreover, the 3G is the intensification of the great game politics in changing geopolitical dynamics of the anarchic world order and the imposition of a grand strategic plan by major power to achieve their strategic goals. Lastly, the substantial impacts of this game on Afghanistan and the South Asian region are the outcomes of a war-oriented geostrategy policy of the major powers and their disorganized collective aggression by proxy wars. The Grand Great Game is a backfire of the US planned strategy of Cold War after the Soviet invasion. As indicated by a senior Indian professor that ""the US responded by promoting and pitting Islamists/mujahedeen against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Saudi funds and Pakistani muscle turned the US strategy into success by evicting the Soviets from Afghanistan. But it had dangerous unintended consequences for the subcontinent, as a Frankenstein's monster was created not in the US but in the region , which is still grappling with the rise of Islamic extremism and terrorism"" . Therefore, this study establishes that the 3G is not a traditional chessboard game of international politics in which the only two powers are involved for pursuance of their grand agenda and imperial powers generally acted for 'rational' security and hegemony. Rather, in this game, multiple states have to design reactions and re-actions according to the perverse results of unplanned actions. Moreover, the unexpected responses are planned by taking past and present geopolitical developments into consideration. In changing dynamics of global geopolitics and complex interdependency, states usewar - direct or indirect - as a rational tool to gain political goals to cope with the challenges emerged as a result of security maximization and supremacy by socially-oriented means based on norms with realistic goals . Briefly, it is a combination of geo-economic and geocultural competitions - other than geopolitical contest of all great games and wars in Afghanistan. As stated by an Indian analyst, ""Hence there is the need to look beyond geopolitics and see through the possibilities of geo-economic and geo-cultural cooperation in this 3G between India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Regional economic cooperation will bring both peace and prosperity to the region and its peoples"" . Another expert described this topic in different words; , prior to 9-11 conflict between states was assumed to occur because of power clashes over conflicting interests . Post 9-11 revealed the extent to which cultural values, cultural worldview , and identity play a role in relations between states. Thus, there is a need for reconsideration of additional factors . The 3G is a boomerang of the US military interventionism in which Afghanistan has transformed into an international conflict with regional flavor . Changing of Afghan conflict into a full-fledged international conflict is one of the unseen consequences of the 3G. The Global War on Terror and proxy wars in Afghanistan are basically harbinger of this international nature of Afghan quagmire during the 3G, in which heterogeneous non-regional and regional players are fighting for their political goals under the cover of collective 'war' against terrorism. The players especially the US-led Western world, India, Japan, Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia and so forth are on one side engaged in cooperation to resolve the conflicting situation of terrorism in this land from decades, simultaneously they are busy in confrontation for their own strategic interests. The 3G is a dynamic conflict of interests and constant struggle for global primacy to be played by the United States even following 9/11, and this struggle shares geopolitical competition factor with all previous great game-like competitions. The international conflict of Afghanistan has transformed the nature of global rivalry of great game politics into a regional one in which regional players - Pakistan and India in South Asian region - are confronting each other for conflict of interests in the emerging current geopolitical developments of anarchic and complex interdependent world structure. As Buzan and Wæver proclaim that external major powers have played the regional great games in Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. However, the nature and scope of game being played in South Asia is different because the epicenter of this game is Afghanistan. Proxy conflict started becoming prominent feature of international politics partly after the end of Cold War and wholly after 9/11, as Hughes argue that ""proxy warfare is in itself also partly a legacy of the Cold War"" . In the current situation due to the US role in Afghanistan and de-hyphenation policy in South Asian, the two countries are entirely different for the US. ""In post 9/11 scenario, US devised Af-Pak policy which was aimed at treating both the countries as one. So, in this case one can make out clearly that the Pakistan is state which is treated with sticks and India with carrots"" . An Afghan expert states that ""Afghanistan is part of India and Pakistan's proxy war having replaced Kashmir as a battlefield between both the two rivals"" . Pakistani political analyst explained, ""There is a proxy war going on in Afghanistan between India and Pakistan. The fear and mistrust among these two countries is more than the actual conflict. Indian phobia among the Afghans is much more than what it actually is. The amount of money and energy the Indians are spending in Afghanistan, their achievements are nothing comparing the efforts and money Pakistan invested . An Indian political observer expressed, ""I would stick to the official position of India, and which states clearly that it is in Afghanistan for Afghanistan. In the span of last four decades, India has not cultivated a proxy for itself in Afghanistan the same way as Pakistan has. This has come with its own advantages and disadvantages. But overall, it makes sense to conclude that India does not lead a proxy war in Afghanistan both because it does not want to and it cannot . But on the other hand, another senior Indian analyst at JNU maintained that ""India decided to court Afghan governments to limit Pak influence in Kabul"" . The US war on terror and a wave of terrorism inside Pakistan has diminished the latter's policy of publicly supporting the Taliban fighters but have maintained a considerable influence over these groups in Afghanistan. India also enjoys the services of multiple groups inside the Afghan territory capable of mounting terrorist attacks on Pakistan's economic and military installations. The proxy conflict between Pakistan and India in Afghanistan being a theatre for such a war has increasingly changed the geo-political and strategic dynamics of the region and has transformed the region around Afghanistan and Central Asia into a flashpoint for a possible military engagement among regional powers. A Pakistani expert maintained that ""the power struggle between Indian and Pakistan in Afghanistan is complex because of the role of great major powers. Chinese aim does not fully coincide with Russians. At best we can broadly categorize these countries into two. The US and India want controlled and continued chaos in Afghanistan to contain and check rise of China and resurgence of Russia. China, Russia, and Pakistan want peace in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of United States and NATO foreign forces from Afghanistan"" . Pakistani circles maintain that India is operating terrorist activities against Pakistan via Afghanistan and Islamabad possesses serious security apprehensions and concerns against the India's strategic foothold in its backyard . A senior Pakistan professor expressed that India is encircling Pakistan through Afghanistan and Iran. India used this as opportunity and Kulbhushan Jadhav did all his activities in Baluchistan and Karachi through Iran. After 9/11, India has entered in Afghanistan extensively and Afghan soil is constantly being used against Pakistan. This is a stated policy of India that let's bleed Pakistan and let's use all anti-Pakistan elements within Pakistan and within Afghanistan against Pakistan for cause of terrorism . On the other hand, the US just invaded Afghanistan without any organized and constructive planning, therefore, after fighting 17 years long war, the international conflict of Afghanistan is still unresolved. According to M. Kamal, ""the term 'Grand Great Game' can be reconstructed under the evolving political scenario and US continuous and unjustifiable presence in Afghanistan against the uncertain threat of terrorism , moreover, rising Chinese status and refortification of the Russian role in Central Asia. The US-India nexus is another emerging bloc in Afghanistan that reaffirms the changing geopolitical dynamics and security patterns in post-9/11"" . Maley's argument seems wrong when he explains that ""for escalating international conflict situations and crises, assuming that the intervening power works with a clear political objective and plans well, the faster an intervention is deployed, the greater its chances of success. Paradoxically, crises often have to attain a certain level of severity before enough political support in the intervening state can be mustered for active involvement. Appropriate contingency planning is essential if an intervention is to occur expeditiously"" . Conclusion Afghanistan problem has been contextualized and comprehended in the great game politics to understand the story of unintended consequences of historical events related to foreign interventions in Afghanistan from the Soviet invasion to the 9/11 incident. As in inference, it is concluded an idea that the foreign intervention in Afghanistan has shrunk the scope of the international politics into a regional power struggle which remains a case of serious consequences. While analyzing the foreign interventions in Afghanistan, started back in 1979 with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the later situation that the policy makers of 1980s were expecting after the Soviet withdrawal were also not much worrisome; for, they thought the Soviet withdrawal would stabilize Afghanistan and the region. However, the situation created in the aftermath of post-Soviet boots was terrible, since it observed multiple unintended consequences of the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan. It did not only empower groups like the Taliban to emerge but also catalyzed the use of Opium and Heroin in the world. Transformation of mujahedeen into the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were the perverse unintended consequences of the US rational foreign policy actions. Moreover, the 9/11 incident is considered a yardstick in changing geopolitical scenario and security patterns not only in international arena but also in the canvas of Afghanistan. However, in this scenario, changes in geopolitical dynamics and security patterns altered the nature and scope of the great game into the 3G. As unseen consequences of the 3G, foreign intervention of the sole superpower in Afghanistan has shrunk the scope of the international politics into a regional power struggle which is deemed a case of serious consequences to the international and regional security and stability along with terrorism. The US de-hyphenated the South Asian key player, i.e. Pakistan and India. This policy of the sole superpower in the post 9/11 era adversely affected the relationship between the two neighbors and heralded the penetration of regional-based great game geopolitics in the South Asia. As Buzan proclaims this point as ""a variety of regional 'great games' is being played out by rival external powers in Central Asia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa...But South Asian politics is different in sense that this game is being played put in Afghanistan, located at its periphery . The political commentators agreed on this point that the proxy warfare between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan is a zero-sum game, since D'Souza expressed that India's growing aid diplomacy in the strategic backyard of Pakistan proven to be fatal between zero-sum rival. She further explained that the westerns dubbed this rivalry as the 'new great game', the source of insecurity and anarchy in the region that assures the renewal of 'Great Game' geopolitics that once played out there and in some ways or other still continue . But this study has drawn out three basic findings: the 9/11 incident was a perverse consequence of the US Cold War policies which paved the way for the 3G, wherein the regional and non-regional players are involved in complex strategic engagement under a new international structure unimultipolarity with sub-regional great games and competitions along with cooperation for universal threat of terrorism; India-Pakistan rivalry in Afghanistan is a traditional chess game in Afghanistan international conflict with regional taste; and Pakistan-India proxy war in Afghanistan is a backfire of the Grand Great Game which is accepted by most of the research participants.

4d613706e33d4486b39fb81bdc993a2d,beijing urge moscow,It was a tragic irony that in less than one year Nagy's wishful thinking of the application of the Five Principles to the Hungarian-Russian relations and his illusion about China's sympathy for the Hungarians would evaporate when Beijing urged Moscow to intervene and the People's Daily was one the first communist papers to praise the suppression.12,"In Hungary, the Chinese influence was reflected in the ideology of emerging Hungarian nationalist communists, particularly in Imre Nagy's admiration of China's Five Principles of coexistence. Nagy, who was purged during Stalin's later years, rehabilitated during the New Course, and appointed as Hungarian premier from late 1953 to 1955, proposed his reformist line that included easing the tempo of industrialization, allowing peasants to leave collective farms, and relaxing police terror. For this he was ousted in March 1955 by Hungarian Stalinists led by Matyas Rakosi. In his forced retirement, however, Nagy sensed the coming political storm and wrote a lengthy thesis titled ""In Defense of the New Course"" in late 1955 and early 1956. The paper was later published as a book in the West under the title On Communism, in which four major issues were addressed: industry, agriculture, political terror, and foreign policy. In the foreign policy chapter, China's Five Principles of coexistence became the pillars for his theoretical framework defending Hungarian national sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union. The Five Principles of coexistence included mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.9 China first proclaimed these principles in a communique with India in 1954. Then in 1955 at the Bandung Conference of Asian and African states, Zhou Enlai formally proposed them to all non-Western countries as the principles of international affairs as opposed to colonialism. The official Chinese statements referring to these principles often came with a restrictive phrase, ""between states of different social systems,"" which was made to allay the noncommunist Asian countries' fear about revolutions exported by China, but left unclear whether they could apply to ""states of the same social system."" The title of the foreign policy chapter in Nagy's paper was ""The Five Basic Principles of International Relations and the Question of Our Foreign Policy."" Not only were the Five Principles used as the overarching thesis in the chapter, but also it was announced that they ""must extend to the relations between the countries within the democratic and socialist camps.""10 Nagy's paper was circulated among dissident Hungarian communists, and in the spring of 1956 Nagy delivered one copy of his paper to the party's central committee and another to Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov, the Russian ambassador in Budapest.11 It was a tragic irony that in less than one year Nagy's wishful thinking of the application of the Five Principles to the Hungarian-Russian relations and his illusion about China's sympathy for the Hungarians would evaporate when Beijing urged Moscow to intervene and the People's Daily was one the first communist papers to praise the suppression.12",IIR

23f56e9cec2e4859bac19821b5a640f6,mep urge russia,MEPs further urged Russia and China to condemn the lethal use of force by the regime and to impose sanctions.,"The outbreak of pro-democracy protests in Tunisia in January 2011 developed into a wave of Arab popular uprisings that shook the Arab world, moving its way from the Maghreb to the Levant by March of the same year. The civilians of the town of Dara'a near the Jordanian border, took to the streets in protest against the torture inflicted by the Syrian regime on a number of local students who had been responsible for painting anti-government graffiti. The demands of the protesters evolved from the simple release of the students into broad, Syria-wide reforms, such as the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, introduction of multi-party democracy, instituting equal rights for the Kurds, and broader, more basic, human rights and political freedoms such as the freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly. By April the regime under al-Assad had reacted to these demands and formally repealed the 1963 emergency powers law that had granted the government sweeping powers to suspend constitutional rights. Yet, just as it seemed Syria would be yet another Arab state to give into the demands of demonstrators, the Syrian government launched a series of brutal crackdowns on protests.1 These actions of the Syrian government led to unrest throughout the country culminated into a civil war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights2 by March 2018, seven years after the start of the conflict, documented the deaths of 353,900 people, of which 106,000 were civilians. The civil war had resulted in about 1.5 million casualties of war with permanent disabilities, including within that number 86,000 who had lost limbs as a consequence of the conflict with a further 6.1 million Syrians fleeing the violence and danger, becoming internally displaced, whereas another 5.6 million had fled Syria for safety abroad to adjacent states and further afield to Europe and elsewhere. In just a matter of three months, from January to March 2019, an estimated 7,770 civilians were killed in Syria as a result of the ongoing conflict.3 For Europe, the Syrian conflict cannot be viewed or understood as events in a far-off Middle East. The geographic proximity of the Arab world to Europe has led it to be traditionally viewed as close to the ""backyard"" of Europe, separated by sea and deserts but still close to major European centres of population. It is because of this geographic proximity that Europe is consequently affected by what are ostensibly localised disturbances within the wider Middle East region. The Mediterranean may be Europe's ""backyard,"" and conflicts close to that ""backyard"" can result in more direct effects upon Europe.4 Syria signed a Cooperation Agreement, which governed its trading relationship with the European Union in 1977, beginning the formal relationship between the two. Syria would also become a part of the EU's Union for the Mediterranean, the Barcelona Process, the European Neighbourhood Policy and was in the process of completing the EU-Syria Association Agreement when the Syrian Civil War broke out.5 EU's Political Stance on the Syrian Crisis On 22 March 2011, the EU foreign policy High Representative, in a statement expressed the EU's 'profound concern' at the developing situation in Syria, and noted that the EU 'strongly condemned the violent repression, including through the use of live ammunition, of peaceful protests'.6 In a month's time and with no improvement in the behaviour of the Syrian regime, along with calls from the then US President Barack Obama, the EU also called for President al-Assad to 'step aside,' HR Ashton stated in a press release: ""The EU has repeatedly emphasized that the brutal repression must be stopped, detained protesters released, free access by international humanitarian and human rights organizations and media allowed, and a genuine and inclusive national dialogue launched. The Syrian leadership, however, has remained defiant to calls from the EU as well as the broad international community including Syria's own neighbours. This shows that the Syrian regime is unwilling to change. The President's promises of reform have lost all credibility as reforms cannot succeed under permanent repression. The EU notes the complete loss of Bashar al-Asad's legitimacy in the eyes of the Syrian people and the necessity for him to step aside.""7 The same stance was also reflected by other EU's institutions. The EU Parliament in September 2011 demanded an immediate halt to government crackdowns, for the Syrian regime and Assad to immediately relinquish power and for the establishment of a transparent investigation into all alleged human rights abuses. MEPs further urged Russia and China to condemn the lethal use of force by the regime and to impose sanctions. In the next month, the EU Parliament took the step to support the Syrian democratic opposition forces through a resolution. Clearly establishing the EU's stance on the legitimacy of the Syrian regime - there was none in their view.8 The European Council, the body responsible for defining the EU's overall political direction and priorities clarified the EU's position that the Syrian people themselves had a right to decide the future of their country without the fear of repression in October 2011. High Representative of the Union Catherine Ashton also indicated that if the Syrian regime continued with its programme of repression, the EU would be forced to apply further and more comprehensive measures against the Syrian regime,9 and her statement on the 1st of February 2012 called on the UN to take strong action against the Syrian regime.10 Following the EU-US declarations, the EU stressed Al-Assad to step down from Syria's Presidency had been reiterated by the Arab League with the Kofi Annan six-point peace plans submitted on March 16, 2012, to the UN Security Council.11 The six-point plan called for a Syrian-led political process to transfer political power, a UN supervised ending of the armed conflict in Syria in order to stabilize the situation, effective coordination of humanitarian assistance, the release of arbitrarily detained persons to be sped up, freedom of movement for journalists to be ensured, and for the regime to respect the right to peacefully demonstrate as well as of freedom of association.12 The European Union's policy settled in its response package JOIN 22 stated that its aim was to bring together the EU and its Member States' policies regarding the issue of justice in order to ""contain and resolve the Syrian crisis to promote access to justice and accountability"". The response package engaged ""multilateral fora in order to ensure the on-going and systematic violations of human rights, international humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms."" The EU played a ""leading role"" in dealing with the crisis and was a key driver behind the United Nations Human Rights Council's decision to form a UN Independent Commission of Inquiry. The response package went on to state that the EU ""should ensure that its concerns regarding the widespread violations of human rights are addressed as an integral part of the process to bring an end to the conflict."" Additionally, the EU's position was to remain that, ""if concerns about war crimes and crimes against humanity are not adequately addressed on a national level, the International Criminal Court should deal with the situation."" 13 The points in the RP were again addressed in the EU's strategy for Syria in April 2017, with the EU reiterating its demand for effective accountability for war crimes committed in the Civil War.14 In the third Brussels conference, the EU emphasized again the importance of justice and accountability for a sustainable peace to take hold and suggested that the war crimes committed in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.15 With regards to ISIL/Da'esh, the European Council on October 2014 calculated the growing proliferation of ISIL and other radical groups in Syria as a significant threat to the security and integrity of the wider Middle East region and the world at large. The EU's High Representative presented a detailed strategy for the EU to adopt with regards to Syria, Iraq and the ISIL threats. On 16 March, 2015, the Council of the European Union provided further furnishing of the EU's role in dealing with the ISIL the crisis in Syria, entitled ""Elements for an EU Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the ISIL/Da'esh threat"".16 The strategy aimed to: • Support the efforts of the international Coalition in countering the threat of ISIL. • Decrease the supply of foreign fighters, monetary funds and weaponry into ISIL. • Prevent further ISIL regional spill-overs and improve border security of neighbouring states. • Provide desperately needed humanitarian aid and international protection to those negatively affected by ISIL.17 The European Council in its meeting held on December 15, 2016, repeated the EU's demand for the Syrian regime to cease hostilities in Syria immediately and committed the EU to working constructively with all partners, under the auspices of the UN, towards a political transition as agreed upon in the UNSC Resolution 2254, emphasizing the need to ensure accountability for war crimes. 18 In an April 3, 2017, the EU Council meeting adopted many decisions, agreed on the need to develop a specific strategic framework for its approach to Syria. It endorsed the objectives which framed clear lines of action on all the dimensions of the crisis, stated below. The EU's aims with regards to Syria were summarized into the following six primary areas: 19 • Instituting a genuine Syrian-led political transition ending the Syrian Civil War. • Encouraging meaningful transition in Syria to be inclusive and non-sectarian. • Fulfilling the humanitarian needs. • Promoting the principles of democracy, human rights and freedom of speech. • Promoting accountability for war crimes committed against the Syrian people. • Supporting the resilience of the Syrian population and society.20 EU's engagements with other international partners in Syrian peace process With regards to the political process, the EU has mostly taking a backseat role, despite the fact that together with individual member states it has engaged in, and supported the political process under the auspices of the UN.21 Federica Mogherini, UNSC High Representative/Vice-President in March 2019 stated categorically the EU's stance on the Syrian conflict; consider it sustainable solution from a UN-led process and from the implementation of the UNSCR 2254,22 a ""road map for a peace process in Syria, setting a timetable"" for talks between the major warring parties, with responsibility for the Crisis placed on all sides so as to avoid either side outright refusing to enter into negotiations.23 The UNSC's first consideration of the unfolding events in Syria took place during an unrelated meeting on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in April 2011. The United States, and EU member states, Britain, France, and Germany expressed their serious reservations and concern regarding the level of force being used by the Syrian regime against the demonstrators, while Russia considered this response an unacceptable external interference in the internal matters of Syria. The UNSC held its first session focused entirely on Syria within a few days of this previous meeting which featured South Africa, Brazil as well as other states, joining the growing number of countries condemning the actions of the regime and encouraging a speedy conclusion to the violence. They were joined by Russia, China and India who expressed their concern at the development of events in Syria. Regardless, Russia reasserted that the developing situation in Syria did not constitute any major threat to the peace and security of the international community.24 In May 2011, a draft resolution sponsored by major EU member states was introduced to the Security Council denouncing the regime's crackdown of the demonstrators and called on the government to immediately cease exercising force against civilians and stressed the need for accountability. Additionally, draft resolution called upon UN member states to prevent the supply of arms and military-related material to Syria. The draft resolution rejected by the Chinese and Russians, who threatened to veto the draft. Other states including Brazil and India expressed their objections. A common concern of the delegations was that such a resolution could form the basis for an actual military intervention and subsequent regime change in Syria, as had been the case previously in Libya.25 As a result of these developments, two opposing draft resolutions came under consideration in the UNSC, one drafted by the UK and the other by Russia. The later draft included certain measures such as an asset freeze on key Syrian government officials and an arms embargo that were absent from the latter. This discrepancy between the two drafts led to the UK draft removing their more contentious points in order to make the resolution more receptive. The Chinese and Russian delegations, included a condemnation of violence exercised by state-organs against civilians, as well as a threat of sanctions. The Russian draft on the other hand merely required the regime to implement the protesters-demanded reforms they had themselves agreed to implement. With the Russian draft lacking significant support and the UK draft vetoed, the UN Security Council was divided led to a deadlock. The Arab League had been quick to respond. The Arab League suspended Syria's membership of the organization stressed Assad resignation, plus demanded power transfer to the al-Assad's deputy while a new coalition government to be formed within two months and need parliamentary and presidential elections be held after a further three months. These demands were immediately and, in their entirety, rejected by al-Assad. Failing to pressure the regime into compliance the Arab League requested the UNSC to endorse its plan. The joint vetoes of both Russia and China faced severe backlash from Western states. The US ambassador expressed his ""disgust"" by the vetoes, the UK ""appalled by the decision of Russia and China to veto"", a break from tradition for the British with the ambassador additionally saying that Russia and China had ""failed in their responsibility as permanent members of the Security Council."" 26France went ahead in declaring that ""history will prove wrong, and it will judge them."" 27Even the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that the vetoes will have emboldened the Syrian regime and will lead to an escalation in the violence.28 Despite the growing division and lack of unity in the UNSC, the UNSCs permanent members had unanimously adopted Resolution 2059 which renewed the period of the mandate of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria on 20 July 2012.29 Unlike the UNSC, the UN Human Rights Council responded rapidly in Syria, passed a resolution in April 2011 calling for an investigation into the human rights abuses and war crimes in Syria ""with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring full accountability"". The subsequent Commission of Inquiry on Syria was established for the fulfilment of this aim. Its initial reports required the Syrian regime to properly address war criminals and abuses. However, by its fourth report, the Commission recognised the inaction of the regime with regards to its reports and stated that it was ""incumbent upon the Security Council, influential Member States and regional organisations to act urgently to ensure accountability"", shifting focus and impetus of action from the Syrian government to the Security Council and the wider international community. The report recommended that the UNSC ""take appropriate action... by means of referral to justice, possibly to the International Criminal Court."" 30 In June 2012, Switzerland led the process by drafting a letter to the UNSC requesting a referral, noting that the credibility of the UN would be called into question should it resolve to stay unresponsive to the crimes in Syria. The letter, signed by a total of 57 states, argued that ""without accountability... there will be no sustainable peace in Syria"" and that even the threat to refer Syria to the ICC due to the absence of any credible process within Syria to hold those responsible accountable, the threat ""would have an important dissuasive effect.""31 The letter had been signed by all EU member states barring Sweden. Sweden was of the opinion that the referral itself would pose a significant hindrance in future negotiations with the Syrian regime concerning a political settlement to the dispute.32 However, the chemical attacks carried out by the regime in August 2013 raised the point that by ignoring ensuring accountability for war crimes committed early in the civil war, it has now led to the Syrian regime more confidently attacking their own population with an increase in atrocities, and conflict within the country.33 The UNSC resolution 2554 became the long-sought after foundation for negotiations with the regime in Syria and served as a framework for political transition. The resolution outlined the UN's backing of a Syrian-led political process that ""establishes credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance and sets a schedule and process for drafting a new constitution"" within six months. Its other recommendations were that ""free and fair elections, pursuant to the new constitution, to be held within 18 months"" under the supervision of the UN.34 However, there were still significant divisions within the UNSC over the role, if any, of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Additionally, the resolution failed due to the differing views within the permanent members of the UNSC. Actions against groups considered terrorist organisations including Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front, were not deemed violations of the cease fire, allowing Russian and the US-led coalitions air-strikes against the ""Islamic State""/Daesh to continue.35 The resolution had effectively adopted the stance of the International Syria Support Group, providing the Vienna statement international legal backing but had significant differences, a key one being that the resolution placed responsibility for the crisis on all sides whereas the Geneva communique had singled out the regime.36 Geneva Peace Talks on Syria The EU had also participated in UN-sponsored talks on the future of Syria in Geneva that had presented a potential for a more long-lasting settlement.37 The Geneva Conferences on Syria were a UN-backed international peace conferences on the future of Syria38. Following the failure of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria, special envoy Kofi Annan sought to establish a United Nations ""Action Group on Syria"", and to form a multilateral forum in order to ""agree on guidelines and principles for a Syrian-led political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people"". In June 2012 in Geneva conference was attended by the five permanent members of the UNSC as well as officials from Qatar, Turkey, Kuwait, Iraq and a representative from the EU, but none from Iran - a key player in the Syrian crisis.39 The conference paved the way for a political settlement, calling for the establishment of a power-sharing regime that would, surprisingly, include both members of the government and the resistance.40 The Syrian Civil War continued, with both the regime and opposition forces attempting to gain an advantage over the other before a ceasefire for negotiations came into effect in order to position themselves as in as powerful a position for those negotiations.41 The Geneva II talks in January 2014, to create a process agreeable to both the parties on achieving a political end to the crisis, but failed. The Geneva II negotiations were failures due to three main factors. First, there was no common ground between the involved parties over which armed organizations should be counted to be part of the ""Syrian opposition"". Syrian Kurds under the Yekineyen Parastina Gel were largely excluded out of the process due to Turkish objections. Second, the exiled group that officially represented the Syrian opposition, the Syrian Interim Government, at the Geneva II talks had limited contact with or even control over the rebel units and fighters on the ground. Third, Assad had no incentive to participate as US was not in his favour.42 The failure of the Geneva II talks to yield any result that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fought through and captured large swathes of Syria and then crossed the border into Iraq, seizing land and shifting the focus of the international community from peacemaking between the Assad regime and the Syrian opposition in the civil war itself to combating the terrorist group that made constantly headlines due to their actions. The United States increased its support to rebels fighting such as the Kurds and brought together a coalition of countries to defeat ISIL in 2014.43 The third round of talks of Geneva began in 2016, failed due to Syrian regime retaliation, backed by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militia support, against the oppositions-held areas around the city of Aleppo. While the international community sought to establish a process without the cooperation of the Syrian regime, the Syrian government itself sought to dictate the reality on the ground.44 The proceeding Geneva peace talks IV, V, VI in, VII, and VIII on Syria collapsed with no breakthrough.45 With the escalation of violence in eastern Gouta and Idlib, Russia sponsored peace talks on the settlement of the Syrian conflict in Astana in 2017, and then in Sochi in January 2018 undermining the multilateral process being undertaken by the UN.46 In the 8th round of the Geneva Intra-Syrian peace talks in December 2017, a declaration was issued that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad definitively did not have a role to play in the country's future political transition.47 Friends of Democratic Syria Group/ Friends of Syria The deadlock and subsequent inaction in the UNSC following Russian and Chinese vetoes prompted the US and France to initiate the creation of a group in February 2012 that was referred to as the Friends of Democratic Syria Group/Friends of Syria. It holds no official international status; it is more akin to a group of like-minded states and international institutions that set up a forum to discuss the ongoing crisis in Syria outside of the UN Security Council rather than an actual political entity aimed at providing a workable, agreed upon solution to the conflict.48 The Friends of Syria group held its first conference in Tunis in February 2012 with 60 countries sending delegations including representatives from the UN, the EU, the Arab League, the OIC, Arab Maghreb Union and the GCC. Besides affirming their firm commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of Syria, they condemned the Syrian regime's widespread human rights violations and their failure to stop despite the international outcry. The group reiterated the crucial need to hold those responsible for perpetrating crimes against the Syrian people and end the impunity enjoyed by those perpetrators.49 The Group intent was to take the proper political and economic measures in order to apply pressure on the regime to end its continued human rights violations and prevent the further escalation instability. These agenda point of groups of friends included the following: • Travel ban on the officials of the Syrian government. • Freezing the personal assets of officials of the Assad government. • Ending the purchase of Syrian hydrocarbon products. • Ceasing infrastructure investment in, and financial services relating to, Syria. • To decrease diplomatic relations with the Syrian government. • Prevent the shipment of weapons and related equipments to the Syrian government.50 The Friends' Group additionally recognized the Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrians and sought to increase its communication with and material support for the Syrian opposition forces.51 The Friends Group met the seventh time in May 2013 in Amman and demanded that Hezbollah militias and Iran immediately withdraw from the country.52 Within the Friends of Syria, the core faction were the London 11 comprising of the US, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar. The London 11's meeting in October 2013 was to persuade the leadership of the National Coalition to attend a major peace conference in Geneva next month. They reiterated their stance on the issue that a transition government should be established as part of the final political settlement and that President Bashar al-Assad could play no role in any future government.53 In January 2014 the London 11 held a joint meeting with the Syrian National Coalition in Paris strongly condemned the refusal of the Syrian regime to attend the Geneva negotiations. The Syrian regime yet again found itself condemned by the international community by its violation of UNSC Resolution 2118. Also, the regime's insistence that any future presidential election would have Assad running for office, would be a violation of the Geneva II process.54 Federica Mogherini, EU's High Representative on May 9, 2016 expressed the support of the EU to the joint statement by Russia and the US on the need to reinitiate the ceasefires as a preliminary step to prepare the groundwork for the next meeting of the ISSG. She also made clear to Riad Hijab, Syrian opposition general coordinator, that the Group's expectations of their readiness to engage in the Geneva talks under the leadership of the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, to make the political talks in Geneva work and hence provide a perspective for the country.55 The International Syria Support Group The ISSG was established in October 2015 to facilitate the discussions and negotiations at a ministerial level and to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria. The participants of the ISSG were the US, Russia, the European Union, China, Iran, Turkey, the Arab League, and the UN. The Co-Chairs of the ISSG are Russia and the U.S.56 The ISSG met in Vienna, Austria on October 30, 2015 and on November 14, 2015 consequently to resolve the conflict in Syria, developed ""mutual understanding"" on a number of issues, including that ""Syria's unity, independence, territorial integrity, and secular character fundamental"" and that ""the rights of all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity or religious denomination must be protected.""57 However, the failure of these meetings was that due to the fact it does not include any reference to, nor any plan how to effectively process perpetrators of war crimes, a system of justice and a mechanism for a transitional governments be implemented. These statements would however, despite their perceived faults, eventually become the foundations of the UNSC Resolution 2254 - which also excluded any mention of justice and accountability.58 The ISSG, in a meeting held in Munich in February 2016, issued their united approval and support of the UNSC Resolution 225459, the Vienna Statements of 2015 and the Geneva communique 2012.60 The ISSG committed themselves to a Syrian-led and owned political transition based completely upon the Geneva Communique, stressing the need to end the indiscriminate use of weapons, implement a Syrian-wide ceasefire, facilitate immediate humanitarian access to areas under siege, release any arbitrarily detained people and fight terrorist groups.61 Brussels conferences The European Union, Germany, Britain, Norway, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Nations convened a Conference in Brussels focused on ""Supporting the future of Syria and the region"", in April, 2017.62 The EU and the UN co-chaired the second and third conference on 'Supporting the future of Syria and the region', which held in Brussels in April 2018 and in March 2019. The overall aim of the three Syria Conferences had been to provide much needed support to Syrian people plus gather support of the international community to achieve a political solution to the Syria crisis, along the lines of the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 and the Geneva Communique. The Brussels III also focused on the humanitarian crisis affecting the Syrian populace as well as the international communities hosting Syrian refugees. It additionally stated the international community's intention to provide political and financial support for Syria's neighbours who had undertaken an unbalanced and primary burden of having to host Syrian refugees, notably Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. 63 The last Brussels conference reaffirmed the need for justice and accountability for war crimes for maintaining sustainable and genuine peace and hence called for the issue of the Syrian civil war be referred to the ICC.64 EU's Restrictive Measures Following the beginning of the civil war in Syria in 2011 and the resulting constant escalation and widespread violations of human rights, the EU adopted many restrictive actions towards Syria. The EU's first step against the Syrian regime, was to adopt ""The Council of the European Union, Regulation No. 442/2011 of 9 May 2011 concerning ""restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria"". Regulation 442/2011 represented an early example of the broader and future EU strategy and described measures to be undertaken with regards to Syria.65 Since then, the EU has suspended bilateral cooperation with the Syrian regime and froze the Association Agreement that had been under negotiation before the outbreak of war, in response to the Syrian regime's high handed repression of the peaceful anti-government protests. All of these restrictive actions were undertaken before any thought-out strategy towards Syria was outlined, either from the EU or any other state or international organization. A strategy for Syria was outlined in June 2013 two years after the joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, presenting these measures as steps ""towards a comprehensive EU approach to the Syrian crisis"".66 Before the war, the EU was the fourth largest trading partner for Syria after Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. With the implementation of the EU's restrictive measures lead to bilateral trade volumes contracting substantially over the years, to decrease to only €0.5 billion in 2016, whereby imports from Syria dropped by 97% and exports by 85% as compared to 2011.67 The EU suspended the participation of the Assad regime in the regional programs and institutions such as the European Investment Bank, with the EIB suspending all loan operations and technical assistance to the Syrian government.68 The EU established and then expanded a list of targeted sanctions, including an arms embargo, asset freeze and a travel ban on select key government officials69 which was extended to May 2018 and will remain in place until June 2019.70 Now the European Union extended restrictive measures until June 2020. President Assad and his family were also included on the sanction list in May 2013, and an oil embargo was imposed. Syria consequently suspended its membership of and participation in the Union for the Mediterranean in retaliation.71 The EU put full and complete arms embargo on Syria for two years in response to the violent repression of peaceful protestors by Syrian government forces and the following spiral into civil war.72 However, the EU faced difficulties in developing a coherent policy that would enable them to adopt a strong role in handling the crisis on an international level. The EU's position was further damaged when some countries and groups, among them the Friends of Syria, realized that the EU arms embargo had mostly failed in its purpose and had inadvertently hurt the position of the Syrian Opposition Coalition and the armed groups recognizing its authority. With the supply of weaponry from Russia and Iran, the Gulf States and Croatia, neither the regime nor the jihadist armed groups had been seriously limited by the EU weapons embargo.73 The EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Dublin on March 22, 2013, France and the UK proposed to lift or amend the EU arms embargo to make exceptions for the sale and transfer of weapons to the Syrian opposition simultaneously armed Free Syrian Army in order ""to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria"". While, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden showed their reservations, especially on the practicality of the assurances given by the Britain and France that weaponry could be directed to moderate rebel groupings and kept out of the hands of the more radical Islamist elements in Syria - Germany and Austria, favored easing economic sanctions on rebel-held areas of Syria to strengthen the rebel's position. This apprehensive environment pleaded that if a consensus to renew arms embargo by June 1st could not be reached, then not just the arms embargo but all other EU sanctions against the Syrian regime would lapse.74 Further, British and French determination to act alone, not only confirmed this possibility, but also led to extension of the Syrian conflict.75 The common approach of the EU member states towards the arms embargo was doomed by May 2013, and the member countries opted to pursue their own independent policies towards Syria. The fractional approach in Syrian conflict was again demonstrated when the EU opposed direct military intervention in Syria in retaliation to the alleged chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013 by the Syrian regime on the outskirts of Damascus which had resulted in hundreds of civilian dead in direct contravention of international humanitarian law.76 The EU President on November 2013 adopted a neutral position calling for a political solution to the crisis in Syria, with military intervention in Syria being supported only by France and the United Kingdom. Subsequently, the UK government forced to adopt a policy against military intervention when the UK Parliament rejected the possibility of UK military action in Syria in a vote in August 2013.77 Germany also avoided joining the US-led coalition bombing Syria on a constitutional basis since foreign German military deployment requires a change in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany.78 In April 2018, the European Council supported the American, French and British airstrikes on chemical weapons facilities in Syria by emphasizing that the EU's stance on the crisis remained to seek a political solution to the dispute within the framework of the UN-led Geneva process.79 However, the response of the EU and its member countries to strikes clearly exposed the strengths and weaknesses of European power. While individual member states wielded the power and ability to engage in military action, the EU in its entirety was paralyzed to do so due to the multiplicity of views within its organization. This weakness being exploited and fostered by countries such as Russia to the benefit of the Syrian regime, which has a clear interest in keeping Europe divided.80 In May 17, 2019, the EU Council extended restrictive measures against the Assad regime and its supporters due to the continued repression of the civilian population until June 1, 2020, in line with the broader EU strategy on Syria. The sanctions currently in place against Syria include an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank held in the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression or for war as well as on equipment and technology for the monitoring or interception of the internet or telephone communications. The EU believes that there can be no sustainable, and legitimate military solution to the Syrian civil war and remains committed to finding a lasting and credible political solution to the conflict in Syria as held in the UNSC resolution 2254 and in the 2012 Geneva Communique.81 This stance also endorsed by the EU's High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the UNSC in March 2019.82 Humanitarian Assistance With regards to the international aid to the victims of the Syrian civil war, the EU and its Member States took the lead. In March of 2019, the Brussels Conference managed to obtain pledges for aid totaling €8.3 billion for 2019-20 and beyond, out of which €6.2 billion was for 2019 after which €2.1 billion was pledged yearly. Of the overall pledge, roughly 2/3 was from the European Union which had contributed a total of €6.79 billion: €2.57 billion from the EU budget managed by the European Commission and €4.22 billion from individual member states. Out of the €2.57 billion from EU budget, €2.01 billion was committed for 2019 while €560 million was committed for 2020 for vulnerable Syrians within Syria and refugees in countries in the region. 83 To date, millions of people have been helped by EU humanitarian assistance, aid such as emergency medical treatment, healthcare, psycho-social support, protection of children and vulnerable people, food, safe drinking water, essential items, and shelters. 84 Since 2011, the EU's humanitarian funding has amounted to €580 million. In Jordan, the EU supports almost 660,000 Syrian refugees, most of them women and children, by supplying cash assistance, protection, and healthcare. In 2017, €55 million of the EU's humanitarian funding allocated to Jordan also targeted the emergency needs of more than 45,000 refugees stranded along its northeastern border with Syria and Iraq. Another €36 million was allocated for 2018. In Egypt, which hosts upwards of 122,000 registered refugees, the EU has allocated €7.8 million to help refugees living in substandard conditions in urban areas through healthcare, education and cash assistance. Since 2012, the EU's humanitarian aid to Lebanon has reached around 750,000 Syrians. An additional €4 million was earmarked for 2018.85 In Turkey, there are an estimated 4 million refugees, of whom 3.6 million are Syrian.86 The EU had pledged €6 billion in aid to refugees in Turkey. However, since June 2019 only €2.22 billion were disbursed.87 Conclusion The geographical proximity of Europe to the Middle East means that Europe cannot ignore the internal developments that take place in the neighbouring states in the Middle Eastern region. The effects of the refugee crisis are huge on the EU. In the Syrian civil war, the EU re-focused its attention from economic and political partnerships with Syria to the application of sanctions and scaling down of its mission in Damascus. The aim undoubtedly was to punish the Syrian regime for their human rights violations but the secondary effects of these measures was the reduction of the EU's political leverage within Syria and a worsening state of existence for the already battered populace. The EU sacrificed what political leverage it had when it joined the US in pursuing Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to step down without having the power to force. With the increasing influence of Iran and Russian air support for the current Syrian regime and Assad's triumph over most of his rivals on the battlefields of Syria, his resignation seems an unattainable goal without the cooperation of Syria's supporters, Russia, Iran and China. To further make the situation worse for the US and its allies. All of these factors helped compounded the already worsening refugee and humanitarian crisis taking place in Syria. The EU has taken a back seat with regards to who has the leading role in the conflict. This stems from the EU's institutional make-up, with the 28 member states of the EU all failing to find a common stance on the issue, and without a common stance, the EU is internally paralyzed as to what its role in the conflict should be? What is common amongst all the members states regarding the conflict are their primary concerns, those being migration and terrorism. The EU's fractured response to these issues has mainly been due to the wave of far-right political developments in its member states such as 'Brexit' in the UK and the rise of the AfD in Germany, developments that threaten the integrity of the Union. Hence, demonstrating how events in Syria have had drastic socio-political consequences for Europe. The major players in the EU with regards to the Syrian crisis are France, Germany and the UK. Each with their own aims regarding the role that they have as individual states, and collectively as a Union. The smaller member states have to choose to fall in line with one of the ""big three"", for example: the Netherlands has decided to side with the German position and hesitate over military intervention, choosing to push more responsibility towards the UN Security Council. The major question of how far member states are willing to militarily intervene is another issue in this crisis that the EU member states have been unable to find a consensus on. Some member states will argue that military intervention remains the only meaningful and practical option to remove Assad from power and others will express their reluctance towards it, arguing that military action will only make the situation worse. Libya is a case in point. So, instead of a military intervention support, the anti-interventionist states support revitalizing the failed UN-sponsored Geneva talks among the warring actors in Syria. The EU has been able to agree upon is embargo on Syria, blocking the sale of arms and setting in place economic sanctions against the regime. The Syrian regime is trying to mitigate the effects of crippling EU and European Investment Bank sanctions by turning towards its allies Russia and Iran. Syrian goods found markets in Iraq and Lebanon while the Russian banking sector helped make funds available that the EIB had withdrawn or made unavailable. The oil embargo that proved crippling initially for Assad's forces was sidestepped with imports from Russia and Iran. These efforts helped reduce the impact of the EU's sanctions, allowing Assad to continue the war and further diminished already crumbling EU political leverage over Syria. Another key aspect of the EU's role in Syria is its coordination with the US with regards to sanctions and for individual member states, limited military intervention. In the initial stages of the conflict the US and the EU, restricted themselves but the cumulative effects of the civil war forced them. It was in response to the growing radical Islamist presence in Syria that the US, moved to take military action against them. The EU however, still lacking a consensus, was too paralyzed to follow the US's footsteps and engage even the terrorist organisations militarily. The EU is still searching for the common stance towards the conflict. The EU's focus on soft power projection, preference for legal solutions, and enthusiasm for multilateral diplomacy, has found it struggling to change the direction of the Syrian conflict, a conflict that is seen to be dominated by hard power politics in an increasingly multipolar world. The EU has often tried, and failed in many regards, to be a crisis manager, whether it be in Syria, Libya or in the Ukraine crisis. It's lack of hard power capabilities has played a vital role in its failures. This military deficiency, that will continue for the foreseeable future, as well as the limitations of soft power projection were major reasons behind the EU failing to achieve its stated objections. Having made tall demands of Syria and lacking any ways of forcing compliance the EU finds itself in a difficult position, a position where the only options are an insistence on Assad's resignation or a retraction of their earlier stance and an attempt to reach a compromise with the regime. None of the options are good for the image and standing of the EU. The EU will further lose clout in the international arena, making its weaker among the international actors. There are, however, a number of possible actions the EU can take in order to regain some of its lost influence in the Syrian crisis: 1. The EU can bargain its economic strengths in return for concessions from the regime during negotiations: All the pre-war agreements between the EU and Syria, such as the Association agreement and cooperation programmes such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the economic support of the European Investment Bank with its loan operations and technical assistance to the regime, can be used as incentives for the Syrian regime to be more compliant in its behaviour. Additional benefits from such a move would be to combat Syria's war economy by re-legalising Syria's formal economy. It would help in providing more humanitarian aid in more parts of Syria to those who need it most. 2. The EU can also send a monitoring mission to ensure local ceasefires in Syria are upheld as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy. 3. The EU can also increase its support and aid for the local, democratic and legitimate actors in particular the Local Administrative Councils in Opposition-held Syria or LACs.

This war was the culmination of a vicious circle, involving hvo alliances: Germany and Austria-Hungary,a on the one hand; France, Great Britain, and Russia, on the other. The crisis began with the assassination of an Austrian archduke in Serbia followed by an ultimatum from Austria to Serbia and a declaration of war. Russia, which was determined to protect Serbia, mobilized against Austria and Germany. Germany, fearing a Russian invasion, warned Russia that continued mobilization would lead to war. When Russia refused to comply, Germany declared war on Russia and France and announced a plan to invade France through Belgium. This brought Great Britain into the war on the side of Russia and France.It is interesting to compare the crisis of 1914 with several earlier crises, involving members of the same alliances, which did not lead to war. In 1905-06 Germany became involved in a conflict with France over the control of Morocco which looked as if it might lead to war. This crisis was resolved in an international conference.

Nagy, who was purged during Stalin's later years, rehabilitated during the New Course, and appointed as Hungarian premier from late 1953 to 1955, proposed his reformist line that included easing the tempo of industrialization, allowing peasants to leave collective farms, and relaxing police terror. For this he was ousted in March 1955 by Hungarian Stalinists led by Matyas Rakosi. In his forced retirement, however, Nagy sensed the coming political storm and wrote a lengthy thesis titled ""In Defense of the New Course"" in late 1955 and early 1956. The paper was later published as a book in the West under the title On Communism, in which four major issues were addressed: industry, agriculture, political terror, and foreign policy. In the foreign policy chapter, China's Five Principles of coexistence became the pillars for his theoretical framework defending Hungarian national sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union. The Five Principles of coexistence included mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.9 China first proclaimed these principles in a communique with India in 1954. Then in 1955 at the Bandung Conference of Asian and African states, Zhou Enlai formally proposed them to all non-Western countries as the principles of international affairs as opposed to colonialism. The official Chinese statements referring to these principles often came with a restrictive phrase, ""between states of different social systems,"" which was made to allay the noncommunist Asian countries' fear about revolutions exported by China, but left unclear whether they could apply to ""states of the same social system."" The title of the foreign policy chapter in Nagy's paper was ""The Five Basic Principles of International Relations and the Question of Our Foreign Policy."" Not only were the Five Principles used as the overarching thesis in the chapter, but also it was announced that they ""must extend to the relations between the countries within the democratic and socialist camps.""10 Nagy's paper was circulated among dissident Hungarian communists, and in the spring of 1956 Nagy delivered one copy of his paper to the party's central committee and another to Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov, the Russian ambassador in Budapest.11 It was a tragic irony that in less than one year Nagy's wishful thinking of the application of the Five Principles to the Hungarian-Russian relations and his illusion about China's sympathy for the Hungarians would evaporate when Beijing urged Moscow to intervene and the People's Daily was one the first communist papers to praise the suppression.12",broad

Turkmenistan is the single major source of natural gas that can help keep the supply sufficient for European markets.While the mutually converging interests for exports and imports seem to bind these two countries together, there are tensions .6 However, frequent price disputes and the vulnerability Turkmenistan faces regarding the potential manipulation of its pipeline monopoly by Russia make the diversification of gas pipelines a desirable energy strategy for Turkmen leaders. Recent losses suffered due to a stoppage of exports to Russia in 2009 meant that its gas production fell to 38 bcm from 70.5 bcm the previous year. This stoppage translated into a one-quarter drop in Turkmenistan's gross domestic product . Events such as theApril 9, 2009, pipeline explosion near the Turkmen-Uzbek border demonstrate the tensions. In that case, Turkmenistan accused Gazprom of deliberately arranging the explosion. Russia attempted to leverage Turkmenistan either to reduce the price or the volume of gas or a combination of both prior to resuming the gas flow . This is an example of complex interdependence in that Russia's role as the primary importer of Turkmen gas has actually given Turkmenistan some leverage.",broad

Barnes and Peter Spiegel, ""Fighting May Spark a New U.S. Policy Battle Over Russia,"" The Los Angeles Times, August 13, 2008. In relation to the U.S. reaction to the supposed change in Russian policy, even a very level-headed former diplomat with much Russian experience, Strobe Talbot, stated that: ""Outrage is not policy ...
